plan comes together oh yeah [Music] [Applause] a big fish but look event it 's got a tag in it I 'm gonna do is get me to get the number of that tango pool tag air hope to build sewing up we won 't even be able to find out when this fish was tagged how much it 's grown it 's just on 64 centimeters got the tag number [Music] ready so bill I was pretty excited to catch a tag bearer here in the fitzroy river yesterday right in the middle of town and you 've already come up with the data and it 's really interesting it was actually a stocked fish that was released up above the barrage it 's been out for four hundred and sixty nine days and it 's grown 450 millimeters that 's nearly a millimeter a day is that phenomenal no that 's about normal for the stocked fish up in the freshwater they grow very fast up that much faster than in the saltwater and so that 's not unusual that growth rate the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were very instrumental in in getting the net free zone declared up here are you seeing an impact yet on barramundi numbers oh yes having collected information in the river for 30 odd years we know pretty well what 's going on we even forecasts each season we make a forecast for what to expect in terms of catch rates what we saw prior to the net free zone was generally in the order of half a dozen or so barramundi over a meter long we 're now seeing up in the 20s and 20-plus berra for threadfin where we only saw a very small number of threadfin over me long this last year 's Barrow bounty there were over 50 threadfin that were a meter long so there 's really a lot of big fish in the river right now and what about the crystal bowl how does that work okay what we 've done is we 've set up a whole series of what we call dashboards they provide information on things like catch rates locations where it caches are occurring things like that size range age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's updated daily at the moment we have around about 200 dashboards I think with over a thousand charts graphs and maps that are updated daily so as far as we know that 's a world-first there 's nowhere else in the world in fisheries that are tracking data like we are in real time and what can you tell from looking at that data well it depends on the area we 're in areas where we do have a lot of good data we 're able to forecast farik fairly accurately into the next year where the data is much poorer we still do forecasts but they 've got much bigger ranges on the forecast and when we do our forecasts we 're not just talking sort of airy-fairy oh it 's going to be better than this it 's going to be better than that we 're really talking about predicting in the size range like for barramundi we predict plus or minus 20% in terms of the catch rates so it 's pretty accurate and the last few years we 've been pretty much on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forecast that pretty accurately we 've got a crystal ball website where people can go there and check their own particular areas some of the areas have got very good data and as I said others so not quite so good depending on how much information we 've got we try and collect information for as many sources as possible we use our tagging data from the recreational taggers we also use their catch details when they provide us with their catch information we also we also have access to the fisheries boat ramp surveys we also have access to the commercial catches and then we have access to the the weather which is an important component in their fishery so bringing all those things together enables us to provide a pretty comprehensive picture of what 's happening in different places we do get quite a lot of data from visiting anglers particularly they catch details in the past most data was collected through boat ramp surveys we still do that to some extent that what we try and do is to hone in on the twenty percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the ones that respond most to changes in the environment if you see a change in the in the river conditions it 'll be very quickly reflected in the catches are those top twenty percent we call them the T 20s and there 's some scientific there 's some scientific validity behind using those top 20% wishes so we get a lot of good information coming in from those and visiting anglers who we know that that a good anglers we get information from them as well as from the locals we 've developed a phone app that 's becoming very popular in a lot of the fishing tournaments recently we 've done tournaments in Tasmania Western Australia New South Wales and the northern territories tell me a little bit about this voluntary code of practice when the net free area came in we decided that we wanted to make sure that the fishery in the river was sustainable and so we asked the fishermen around is what they thought would be sustainable fishing practices and then we came up with a voluntary code that voluntary code has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking people to voluntarily limit their catch to two bar to threadfin between sixty centimetres and a meter that 's quite a bit lower than the regulations allow you to do but the interesting thing is with we 've done surveys of the catches in the river 97% of trips actually conform to the code of practice so that 's pretty good other elements of the code of practice include reporting illegal netting or illegal fishing activities also to make sure that you look after the environment rubbish it and and generally those sort of activities that are going to ensure the sustainability of our River into the future if we are to build the Fitzroy fishery here into the future then it 's absolutely imperative that we have a sustainable product there and the only way we can do that is by making sure that we limit the catches but also that we have the data there to understand what is happening in the river at any time [Music],"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

version,7185ocpg2VY,20191010,748.079,"Rockhampton QLD 4700, Australia",1325,welcome to video six for the key topic supply chain collaboration and partnerships to seize opportunities this video provides information regarding collaborative bidding two reasons collaborative business relationships fail key drivers of collaborative business relationships partnership versus collaboration assessing a relationship criticality the collaboration framework and tender Ettie activities supply opportunities within major project supply chains can be easier to attract secure and deliver when working closely with another business in a structured and managed relationship collaboration is the key to long-term business success and competitiveness the Queensland Government through Business Queensland provides guidance for businesses to bid collaboratively for government tenders this guide is also useful for when forming collaborative relationships to bid on major projects the guide explains how to bid collaboratively to increase your chances of winning tenders the pros and cons of collaborative bidding to understand the advantages and disadvantages of collaborative bidding making collaboration work successful business collaborations require commitment understanding planning and communication working as a subcontractor subcontracting is a popular collaborating option and is a good way to enter major supply chains working in a consortium a consortium allows two or more businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaboration agreements checklists this provides the main points issues and topics to address when creating a collaborative work agreement more information and links to business Queensland is provided in your booklet there are two primary reasons why supply chain collaborations or partnerships have not worked the primary reasons for disappointment are unrealistic expectations going into the relationship or expectations were reasonable but were never untick you lated or agreed hence there was no plan for achieving them and failure was the result long term collaborative business relationships require both parties to assess the key drivers of the relationship to structure and agreed action plan to implement the relationship there are many reasons to establish collaborative business-to-business relationships one party or both parties may lack something for example expertise equipment people funds and customer contacts together each party can contribute to the relationship so that both parties can achieve their goals when forming a long term collaborative business relationship for key drivers can be used to identify what the parties want to achieve from the relationship understanding the key drivers of the relationship is critical to articulating and communicating expectations the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in achieving asset efficiencies or cost efficiencies they may be seeking better utilization of assets and cost reductions that might occur in areas such as transportation costs handling costs packaging costs information costs cost or managerial efficiencies the second key driver seeks to understand which party is interested in achieving customer service improvements they may be seeking improvements in customer service performance to increase sales or helping customers to experience benefits such as reduced inventory improved availability which leads to increased sales and more timely and accurate information the third key driver seeks to understand which party is interested in marketing advantages they may be seeking enhancement of the company 's marketing mix through joint programs or entry into new markets or better access to technology and innovation the fourth key driver seeks to understand which party is interested in achieving profit stability or profit growth they may be seeking the potential to stabilize profit or may be seeking to strengthen a relationship which often leads to long term volume commitments reduced variability and sales joint use of assets and other improvements that reduce variability of profits more information to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaboration framework it is important to understand the difference between collaboration and partnership for legal reasons and for the success of the relationship if seeking to form a partnership with a key customer or key supplier the reason for the relationship becomes much more serious the objective is to structure a mutually beneficial and successful commercial relationship that will co-create substantial value let 's now look at the differences between partnership and collaboration partnerships are for existing relationships whereas collaboration is for new relationship or for when management wants to develop a plan for the next 18 to 24 months in partnerships both parties view the relationship has partnership potential in a collaboration both parties do not view the relationship as a partnership but do view that the relationship is important in a partnership both parties are seeking substantial mutual benefit in the collaboration both parties will still gain from the relationship but the benefit will be less than substantial in a partnership the relationship is balanced in a collaboration the relationship is typically not balanced as one party may gain more than the other partnerships can require both parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship is not exclusive in a partnership both parties shared the risks and rewards in a collaboration both parties may not share the risks and rewards in a partnership there is openness and Trust in a collaboration both parties are still protective of their information but Trust is still very important for the relationship to be successful in a partnership joint problem solving is the norm whereas in a collaboration problems can be solved jointly if necessary when assessing the criticality of key business relationships consider the following points the impact on each firm if the relationship were to end the volume of purchases from or sales to the firm the involvement of the other firm in the core competency or primary product the availability of other sources of supply if the other firm is supplier and the percentage of the firm 's profitability if the other firm is a customer the greater the criticality of the relationship the greater the investment or resourcing of the relationship to ensure it is structured and well-managed earlier in this video we learnt about four key drivers that can be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to business relationship the collaboration framework is a tool owned by the supply chain management Institute in Florida this tool is used for structuring and sustaining high performance relationships the tool is used as follows both parties hold a workshop to structure their business relationship company a in Company B each go into separate rooms to assess the four key drivers this allows each team to articulate the business goals for the relationship then both parties come back together to present their requirements that they wish to achieve from the relationship this allows both parties to align their expectations and to jointly establish 18 to 24 month goals and goal priorities for the relationship both teams then jointly develop an action plan which includes developing action items prioritizing the actions establishing timelines and assigning responsibilities the parties then develop their product and service agreement this allows the teams to determine the rules of engagement and summarizes their action plans both parties then implement the agreement by implementing the action plan they then review the performance of the relationship by measuring performance against their joint expectations parties also periodically re-examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key drivers and their goals are appropriate your booklet also provides the partnership model which is used to structure and sustained significant partnership relationships you are now encouraged to completely tender ready evaluation in your booklet regarding supply chain collaboration and partnerships to

goods and services required to complete each stage of the project your booklet provides examples of the goods and services required at each stage a mine major project will commence with three exploration stages to find commercially viable quantities of minerals to mine the three exploration stages require services from suppliers to carry out the exploration the generative stage identifies the general area to be explored the primary exploration stage uses exploratory drilling trenching or sampling to find likely zones of mineral deposits the evaluation stage determines whether mineral deposits are economically viable to develop this stage also involves socio-economic analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction work and commences after all necessary permits and approvals have been obtained this stage represents significant opportunities for suppliers of goods and services to assist the mind to complete the construction work the production phase is the actual operation of the mine where the mine will extract and process the minerals the production phase is the longest stage in the mines life and represents significant opportunities for suppliers of goods and services to assist the mind to operate the mine closure and rehabilitation stage commences once mineral deposits have been exhausted the mine owner must then rehabilitate the site and return the land as close as reasonably possible to its pre disturbance condition suitable for use by traditional owners and as habitat for flora and fauna the monitoring and evaluation stage ensures that a safe and stable post mine landscape has been created the lease relinquishment stage is the final phase of the mining operation and involves a relevant government undertaking an assessment of the extent to which the rehabilitation outcomes meet agreed mine rehabilitation criteria it is important for suppliers to major projects to understand what stage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in within the major project lifecycle

this Fitzroy River fishery is just amazing we are literally in the middle of downtown Rockhampton busy bridges with traffic pouring across them the buildings of the CBD up here and right here is one of the best barramundi and threadfin salmon fisheries on the Queensland coast it 's just remarkable and it just shows what can happen if you get the Nets out it 's not rocket science commercial netting in the Fitzroy River and along a sizeable stretch of coastline either side of its mouth ceased in November 2015 with the creation of the capricorn coast net free zone since then fishing in the Fitzroy has rebounded spectacularly and it 's not hard to see why this massive river system the most extensive on Australia 's East Coast is absolutely loaded with prime fish habitat but finding fish and all of that country isn 't always easy running a high quality depth sounder and knowing how to interpret it is a big key to unlocking the bounty of the Fitzroy so is knowing what gear to use and where to cast it not to mention reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing these water conditions you become quite adept at picking the different water it all looks fairly muddy when you first arrive but there 's this darker colored water that you can see 50 or 60 centimetres in and then there 's the milk coffee coloured water that you can only see about 10 centimetres in and the clearer stuff is definitely better for lure fishing we 're right on the edge of a color change at the moment on the absolute bottom of the tide the tides going to turn in the next half an hour or so and actually start to push in down south where I come from an incoming tide would normally mean clean water getting pushed in from the ocean but we 're a long way from the ocean here and there are a lot of mud flats between us in the ocean so here the incoming tide can actually mean dirtier water and that 's what it 's doing to us at the moment so we may have to turn around and chase these fish with the front of the advancing tide you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about what you 're doing fishing these soft vibes isn 't particularly hard get them out there make absolutely sure you get the vibe to the bottom and that can be a little bit hard to pick when there 's a bit of wind and a bit of tide but if you watch the belly of the line when the lure hits the bottom it 'll relax ever so slightly just for a moment and you know you 've made contact with the bottom so then wind up the slack make contact with the lure and I 'm fishing this quiet southerly today I 'm just a little left follow it back down get back onto the bottom again little left follow it back down so that vibes going up through the water and then it 's also swimming on the way back down and in fact it 's on the way back down but it will usually get it not all the time they 'll hit it on the lift as well she 's got to be really on the ball and what in this wind watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm pretty adept at that after a lot of years of bream fishing and there 's a lot of parallels with fishing for bream on soft plastics and vibes a little bit different once you get the hook in there it 's bigger fish and a fair bit stronger but it can be quite a subtle take the bearer will usually hit a little bit harder but these thread ease can be very very gentle at times stay on the ball work it all the way back I can see on the sounder that we 've got fish right under the boat so I 'm in no hurry I 'll just do a few lifts and drops right under the back of the boat and then I still won 't just rip it in I 'll just wind it off the bottom because they might hit it then and wind it all the way up and then as soon as you can see it look in the water behind it just to make sure there 's not a fish following it and then fire out another cast you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of a day but I 'll tell you what it 's worth that when that line comes up tight and takes off there 's some big fishing gear so official all over the sound up just a matter of working on them lightened up a little bit gone to bit light a leader small alert only got quite lightweight lips their little salt ISM mustards they 're quite fine gauge so I 'm not going too hard on this fish sometimes you 've just got to go light to get the hook nice ready look at the colors of that fish beautiful you can see I 've gone for quite a bright luminous looking lure it 's quite similar to the colors of the threadfin [Applause] beautifully pin they often take it [Applause] not a big threadfin but a beautiful specimen all the same just pinned perfectly on that little number six mustard salt ism hawk small hook but sharp all right oh you 're ready to go here they go I actually moved off those fish to release that last threat thing don 't worry sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take them away nothing 's hurt just to go out 50 meters and let the fish go and I put a waypoint on the GPS and I 've come back into it now and sure enough we 're starting to see if you push on the sounder again crazy bye let 's be safe that Lauren came straight towards me it was just like someone had cut my line suddenly there was no loo always there I wear on the enjoy him instruct and there he was got the flight coming in to rockhampton airport over our heads here right in the middle of the city this is urban fishing at its best erratic fighters very very fast fish very thin when they when they engage that big tail and take off but they 're also incredibly erratic you think you 've lost them and then they 're on again and they 're all over the place double back on themselves such good fun and there it is another beautiful threadfin salmon these guys are at least as good a sport fish as a bearer and they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really unusual fish they belong to a large family of thread fins that are found all around the world there 's a very very big one lives in Africa grows to about 50 kilos this one is called a golden thread fin you can see why or a king thread fin or a thread fin salmon it 's got lots of names depending on where you catch it the biggest characteristic are those whiskers and you can see they 're actually filaments that come out of the fish in front of the pectoral fins and they 're loaded with sensory organs taste buds and the fish use them in this discolored water to find prawns and small fish yeah I 've got my wires here I 'll just clean it up it looks if I can with that yeah threads in salmon definitely not a second prize they are a fantastic fish lightweight hooks they go into easily but they also come out quite easily here we go out of the way look at those whiskers reaching forward and that 's what they do when they round up crohn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskers and round up the prawns jelly prawns they particularly love the little little tiny jelly prawns they can be hard to catch when there are lows right I 'm late I 'll get you back in the water here we go you 're ready to go Rockhampton Queensland 's premier net free zone why not make it your next fishing destination,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

barramundi is an ancient name for a fish with large scales it traces its origins far back in time to the indigenous to rhumble people of what is today there are camped in region of central Queensland for thousands of generations barramundi were an integral part of the indigenous culture and a valuable food source the first Australians only took enough to satisfy their needs they had a true understanding of the value of these fish as malcolm man explains so i 'm from the Darvill nation garble peoples here on our country made up of about four clan groups so yeah over 2,000 generations it 's about connection me and our country here but the Eternals certainly seen a fair bit of change particularly in the last couple of generations in relation to our river and sea country in that so I 'm I 'm fairly passionate about you know the sustainability of these areas barramundi years is one of those animals that you know certainly tells stories about looking after the place sort of a reminder to around what sustainability is and if we sort of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals then you know this you know where we call yadda Baroda Birds respect you really cut across that line of respect for that animal sadly modern man did cut across that important line of respect especially during the long years of intensive commercial netting that took place in the Fitzroy River and surrounding waters the sheer tonnage of fish extracted from the system over this time was nothing short of staggering it was also clearly not sustainable in the long term happily all that has changed the records and community has seized the initiative by embracing one of the state 's largest net free zones and the social benefits have been immense longtime recreational angler and tireless researcher bill sonic provides a wonderful information service to the fishing industry and remain as passionate as ever about the future of the mighty Fitzroy River and it 's fish he also loves nothing better than a little hands-on data collection [Music] not a little there it 's just white people they empty [Music] [Applause] [Music] 45 year to year and fish the number is 17 6 4 4 in the lead-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before the actual election the government particularly through Bill Burton made an announcement that they were going to establish a number of neck free areas along the Queensland coast as part of their election commitment and those three areas were Ken 's McCoy and Rockhampton and everybody thought well you know the Fitzroy was never going to be a net free zone that through bills hard work he bought that about all of the things that we said on the upside are coming to fruition and you don 't have to be Einstein to see that there 's an enormous amount of data out there validating the points we 've made the the bigger guys look at the river on a on an Illiad daily basis and see the amount of activity that there is in and around the river these days relative to what there once was you know it 's an attractive piece for all the reasons we said it would be and tourism is certainly benefiting in this region there 's no doubt of that as well as small businesses as a piggy backing off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a total resetting of the system resetting in a good way because what we have here is much more sustainable than what it was prior to the Nets being removed respected fishing journalist and commentator Steve Starling is one of the many regular visitors who now travel to rockhampton every year to sample the dramatically improved standard of recreational fishing on offer today star low knows that world class action like this will only continue to draw more and more visitors from across the country and around the globe with obvious benefits to the local economy that 's nice when a plan comes together Oh [Music] wasn 't that beautiful even in local creeps like Kerman Creek the interesting thing about that was it always been a net freezer Oh Bob seeing a lot more fish even in that area so it 's really good to see big fish we serve always hard in the system as well moving around a lot more may be used to get these schools the threadfin here when the Nets were in and the massive schools you know especially this time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow them around and I suppose even not so much tile floor but around the closing islands and that sort of stuff when the Barrow movie out there and we know there 's a lot more barrier there this time of year than what it used to be the Fitzroy and its many feeders represent a massive interconnected system with many different habitat types and target species on offer it 's just amazing the variety on offer here in the Fitzroy River around Rockhampton you don 't know whether you 're gonna catch a bearer threadfin salmon a blue salmon one of these beautiful javelin fishel grunta they 're a brim they 're a flathead all kinds of things right in the middle of town I 'm seeing a pretty good increase in fish numbers up in town in Rockhampton definitely lots of smaller fish ative bred over the last few years these numbers of the Barrow and Kings retina have definitely increased yes so it looks like in the group of charter operators that we have in the area that the general consensus is that the numbers are increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is widening as well I found that the flats fishing offshore has improved dramatically as well so the net free zone has been a fantastic thing all round the numbers of fish we see and the shallow water up on the flats now you just don 't see here in areas where the flats are commercially netted so it 's been a great thing for Rockhampton in the whole region some bigger species the mackerel what people didn 't realize that they were netted so they come down and spawn every year in the mouth of the Fitzroy so good to see the numbers of growing mackerel and stuff like that picking up his rocks getting the nets out has had an incredibly positive effect across the whole region with benefits that extend well beyond the mouth for the Fitzroy River intercapital Bay and surrounding waters fish numbers are booming further inland the backcountry and its rich beef cattle grazing lands also offer access to a multitude of fascinating freshwater environments that are set against striking natural backdrops here in rivers creeks wares lagoons and Billabong 's anglers can chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found anywhere in the country the Fitzroy River catchment is truly massive it 's also highly varied and fascinating and with the surface area more than double that of Tasmania there are no shortage of options to be explored while barramundi range through many of these inland waters it 's the unique and fascinating Saratoga that lures so many keen fishers into the backcountry these living fossils provide exceptional sight fishing opportunities for both fly and lure anglers their flesh is full of bones making them a catch and release only prospect and helping to protect their stocks nonetheless there 's still a need for careful management especially in terms of ensuring water quality in these places where they live and breed the other big draw card in the title reaches of the Fitzroy is a wonderful sport fish known as the king thread fin or thread fin salmon fast powerful and tasty they 're present in great numbers but they 're not always easy to catch you can see on the sounder just don 't give up keep working away on them something might trigger them to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lure right across one to know is this point I felt him tap it once and then eat it you may have even touched it for these feelers there 's there 's a big salmon he 's not yellow like they often are here market might have come up fairly fresh from down further in the total water this black oh thank you love well one up for him very silvery often they 're um they 're a golden yellow out of here almost like they should Teresa Lewis yeah see look at that just pin big mouth you know they can eat whatever they want they can eat big pop iron mullet and all kinds of things but they actually spend a lot of time eating small stuff prawns and little baked fish let 's get a length on this guy massive difference of course between for Clinton tip links on a thread fin salmon I 'll tell you both just the coolest fish so he 's about 81 81 and a half to the fourth but 90 well actually get ninety near 98 and a bit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it 's about average for the Fitzroy River here in town now because he 's put in a pretty hard battle I 'm gonna hold him in the water there and swimming me for a little bit before I let him go I 'm just holding him here facing into the incoming tide letting that water slow into his mouth out over his gills and he just bit me quite hard so he 's getting quite close to being ready to go these fish are quite susceptible to merit or moral pressure James but luckily we 're only in about four and a half metres of water here so it 's not such an issue but when you 're pulling them out of nine ten twelve metres of water you need to get them back into the water as quick as possible and you may even need to use a a drop weight to get them down to depths to recompress them but out of the shallower stuff I reckon is going to go pretty well when though net Riera came in we decided that we wanted to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we asked the fishermen around what they thought would be sustainable fishing practices and then we came up with a voluntary code that voluntary code has a number of elements to it one is that we are asking people to voluntarily limit their catch to to Bower to threadfin between sixty centimetres and a meter that 's quite a bit lower than the regulations allow you to do but the interesting thing is with we 've done surveys of the catches in the river 97% of trips actually conform to the code of practice take home a feed dot afrezza fall is pretty much the catch cry that we 've come up with in terms of that and so with with even our visiting anglers now most of them are actually conformed into that code of practice even though they 're probably not even aware that it exists if we are to build the Fitzroy fishery here into the future then it 's absolutely imperative that we have a sustainable product there and the only way we can do that is by making sure that we limit the catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is happening in at anytime where the net free areas extend offshore to encompass surrounding islands and reef systems there 's also exceptional fishing on offer for all manner of exciting marine species such as these Queen fish another one Oh you do from the offshore islands to the rugged tropical coast line through the bays and the vast lower s3 and up to the tidal river reaches to the city precincts of Rockhampton itself fish numbers are booming now that the nets have been removed when conditions are right there are few better places on earth to cast a line miss Fitzroy River fishery is just amazing we are literally in the middle of downtown Rockhampton busy bridges with traffic pouring across them the buildings of the CBD up here and right here is one of the best barramundi and threads in salmon fisheries on the Queensland coast it 's just remarkable and it just shows what can happen if you get the Nets out it 's not rocket science Barrow one cast threadfin the next how good 's this look at the color I 'm just amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffled strike they tend to come up and surround the lool with those big long sensory whiskers and and then they sort of mumble and fumble their way on to it sometimes it 's not a crisp distinctive strike a lot of the times but boy oh boy you know when you get them on fast and erratic is the best way to describe the threadfin they all fight differently some some come in fairly easily others go completely ballistic but there are a wonderful fish also really nice fish to eat but I 'm going to put this one back we are absolutely thrilled here on the beautiful Fitzroy at the success of the Nets razón program this came about through a gutsy move from the state government and Rockhampton at just that moment was looking for ways in which we could increase visitor numbers and we realized that recreational fishing is a huge opportunity for Queensland generally but it really brought major opportunities to us Council grabbed it with both hands there was a little bit of money offered by the state government for marketing but we then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I obviously muchly helped by the fact that the fish are really there but we have seen a significant increase in the number of visitors who are coming here to fish it has reinvigorated fishing as a an activity and hobby among our own community but we 've seen a six-fold increase in the number of visitors to the region who are coming to fish this is a massive catchment that we 've got here it 's the second largest river catchment in Australia largest on the East Coast of Australia and it is home to obviously the barramundi but also throughout things salmon and a host of other fish varieties in fact barramundi is are an indigenous word it 's from our own local to rhumble people and this was the first place that European visitors and settlers saw of a mighty fish so we are thrilled with what the barramundi and red bean salmon and our whole recreational fishing strategy has brought to our community I couldn 't be happier with how things are progressing I still think we 've probably got a couple more years of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I think is a naught will be a normalize level and what when we get there I can 't wait to see what the results will be because you can see now the types of captures that are happening in the system and they are incredible and everybody who 's got the slightest interest in this knows that they see it with their own two eyes and they see the fish being captured you can sit and have a coffee overlooking the river in the Rockhampton now as I 'll be doing this afternoon and you can watch people pulling in digging up and pulling in barramundi literally 30 meters from me so

[Music] but first let 's talk to a lease from the Rockhampton regional councils smart hub so at least when did this markup start 2016 yes it 's brand-new it 's part of the council smart way forward strategy part of the smart boards strategy was to establish a place called the smart hub which is our region 's co-working space and since then I think it was May 2016 we 've have like 25 people businesses working from this space now and startup stars was ready to encourage more startups so more people who wanted to reach international markets more people with global aspirations that would grow start and grow their companies quickly and so startup stars is what it says in the name I 'm looking for star entrepreneurs to start a business and to grow and scale it really quickly to an international market at least tell us about some of the candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates all have a lot of potential we do have a mixed bag of ideas but I do believe that the people involved will with the right mentoring and the right program will be able to reach that international market and well look it 's a pilot program it 's a test like everything in business is a test we 're a start-up essentially so we 're just going to have a go and see what happens [Music] we have five amazing startup stars currently in our program don 't invest our money just at their light bulb moment and I 'm still in development while others are just about ready to hit the Go button so let 's go meet them that Ballinger is a mother of four and has always kept on her toes she realized that finding time to read to her kids can sometimes be difficult but it is important she wanted to create a program where her kids could still have the opportunity to be read a story even when she is busy as a busy mum for me the times like when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids to bed and the other one also wants me at the same time rather than just entertaining them with TV or distracting them where the phone kids can re-engage with the books she landed on the idea of creating kids audiobooks which allows children to select a book from the bookshelf and then find the audio on the kids audiobook website that will read the book to them and provide turn the page prompts and especially for pre readers that can 't read to themselves kids audiobooks provides the audio with the prompt when to turn the page for any book that they 've got on their bookshelf at home in the library Simon lever has been around for many years working in tourism safety aviation and around the world has reached that point in his life where he wants to settle down but he 's not quite ready to call it quits do monitoring we did 24-hour monitoring we actually make sure that the people 's well-being is there we have four

is one of those computer guys who loves to sit behind the screen and code all day long it 's his thing he loves it as the owner of pres Viacom Bruce has been behind a computer for many years creating websites providing web hosting and social media services some of the issues that my clients have at the moment is that their time poor and they don 't know what to do in social media even if they do get to a point that they know what content they need to post they are at the next stage of the problem which is how do I reach out to my leads and how do I engage with them through that through his experience he has identified that many business owners don 't have time to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business these days so how is he going to fix it well Bruce is going to create a platform

tester it 's a product imported from America and it accurately analyzes how many calories or kilojoules you need for your particular body I wanted to create a program where people who really care

I just yeah like to thank everyone for coming along tonight not very often we get a big crowd like this in front of engineers to explain what we 've been doing for last three years but it really apreciate around the time to come along and listen to us we 're very happy introductions that I 'm joined by Brian and Rob so we 'll both do a bit of handing over just to to cover the technical aspects of the project so I 'd like to start with our role so a lot of people are too are a con so we 've we 've operated an office here in Rockhampton for about 17 years we have 30 local staff but we 're much bigger beasts than that I guess if you 're looking at a global perspective so you can see the graphic there in a lot of countries we have a lot of staff and we do this kind of work fairly regularly with flood mitigation projects so it 's just a few of examples this is some work that we have been doing international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on the left is actually a major flood pumping station and floodgate put a big gate up in the top there as well swing gate and then we 've got some earth levees there as well so just gives a snapshot so in terms of our role so we were engaged by council and ultimately we were there to assess the technical feasibility of the south rocky flood levee project our role is to provide independent advice and technical analysis we 're not here to say whether the levee should proceed or not we 're here to give all the informations for ultimately you to make that decision there 's a lot of guidelines and technical standards that that surround levies levies are a major submit for structured projects and so we have to align to those as engineers we also have obtained inputs from a range of stakeholders throughout the design process and overall it 's three of us here but we 're going to be talking for about a hundred technical specialists from a common have been involved on this project both in Australia and the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitions because we will we will talk about this throughout tonight and probably in the QA as well levy I 've got a little definition there but I will have a slide shortly just to explain that most people I 'm pretty sure and aware of what a levy is we will talk about average annual damage and so that 's the cost the long-term annual cost to the community and the economy due to flood damage and so when we do economic evaluations or levies that 's something that we look at we look at what was the damage before annually and what is it afterwards that we can see how that levy performs efflux is another key term that 's used fairly regularly some will be aware of that but FX is basically where we put an obstruction in a flow path we have an increase in water level upstream of that obstruction normally a decrease of flood levels downstream so when we 're talking about a flux that 's what we 're referring to benefit cost ratio is another one which will also be discussed tonight so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project and costs so when the VCR is above one that 's normally an indication that it 's worth considering for funding and for implementation lastly and probably the key one which I 'll cover is annual exceedence probability now when we come to do risk assessments and flood studies and studies and major river systems and as engineers we always talk about annual exceedence probability so that 's the chance that you would have a flood at equal to or greater than that in a given year so some people would have heard the Q 100 or 100 year flood that 's used fairly regularly we won 't be saying that tonight it 's it 's a it 's a terminology that can be misunderstood by the community and some people think is you 've had a 1 in 100 year floods you won 't have that for another hundred years that 's just not the case statistically what we 'd prefer to say is you 've got a 1% chance of that happening each year Emerald 's a good example so emerald had a a major flood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they followed that in two years later and had a 130 years load so they 've had two major floods within two years of each other statistically that 's just how it goes so in terms of levees as a flood mitigation option as Peter mentioned there 's a range of different options and levies aren 't always the answer levees are used in particular circumstances where it warrants them but if the levee is a essential option then what we look normally looking at is raised spread on the earth embankments however there are other types of levees which I 'll go through as well just in terms of how how they get used around the world so it 's about 48,000 kilometers in the u.s. that the US Army Corps knows of that they expect that there 's another 150,000 kilometers of a don 't have documented and that 's across 12 almost 12,000 different systems so the statistics are pretty mind-boggling you 've got two-thirds of the US population is behind a levee over there so it 's frequently used there 's several hundred thousand kilometers then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even in Australia we 've got seven several hundred the several thousand kilometers use in Australia so they are used around the place so just some examples I thought it 's worthwhile just doing a quick snapshot these aren 't all the levees but these are some some key ones this is in Rocky this is in our backyard so this is the Dowling Street levee kershel Gardens for those familiar with that area so it 's an 800 meter long crib wall system so that particular levee was put in place in 2016 protects about 20 homes you can see on the left that was before construction on the right after construction and this was it during the flood so we just add it 's a bit hard to see but that 's the levees running around here so everyone knows about this or those locals familiar with the area so this is our north rocky flood mitigation scheme Stage one of the scheme now there 's a bit of background to this project in terms of planning but the works for this project isn 't just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a significant amount of backflow prevention works done on the stormwater out leading to Lakes Creek Road and also a significant amount of works to the sewer system to prevent ingress from flood water back through the sewer what would hand in hand with this is then temporary flood barrier which was about 380 meters long that was rolled out on Ellison Roberts Street and we had a number of temporary pump stations set up as well at key points to collect any minor seepage that occurred and pump back over so I know a lot of people would have seen those out and about with the trucks pumping some of those flows back over so that 's you can see the system set up and then bottom left during the flood probably the better ones are actually so these are the actual aerial imagery showing what actually occurred during the peak of the flood we 've had this year so cover this one here so for those not aware that Lakes Creek Road is actually is actually a high point all the way along and we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and rail there are higher than the flood fire all the way up to a 1% annual exceedence probability so it 's quite a high level of flood protection offered by Lakes Creek Road the issue we 've had previously is that the rivers gone through the storm water pipes backed up into the area in behind Lakes Creek Road and slaughtered those properties and it 's also come back up around the creek and inundated back through that way as well this is a backward area of the floodplain and with those backflow prevention devices on the road and with the barrier which you can see and feel the shots there we can actually particularly this one that 's where the river came up around the creek and we cut it off by the barrier and protected the homes in here so about 400 properties protected with this stage one of the scheme and stage two of the scheme is ultimately moved that barrier further down and protected more properties and move down to Water Street but Water Street requires reconstruction in order to achieve that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the neighbors up in Makai so because had I had a flood levee system since the 1970s on the Pioneer River it 's a mixed type system so they have earth levees that have vertical flood walls I have crib walls very very similar actually to the South Rocky somebody proposed here longer than ounce 13 kilometers and across seven different levee type levee systems you can see on both sides of the Pioneer River so that system has been in yeah since the 1970s it 's protected Makai on numerous occassions 2008-2010 and even in some of the recent flooding we 've had this year Charleville most people will probably wear this one as well so completed in 2009 upgraded slightly in 2013 it 's protected against three a lot of instance construction again it 's a combination so you 've got some earth levee components we 've got gate crossings across the roads like we have here and some temporary barrier as well and some vertical walls so that 's another example of a flood levee system used in in rural Queensland 20 million dollar cost and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer insurance premiums 990 a year down to 400 after the levee was completed and it 's actually paid for itself already after what 's that about eight years ago the Hunter Valley the Hunter Valley scheme is enormous so it 's got 160 kilometres of sod levee in the Hunter we 've got there 's five basins three spillway overflow points and basically it was the flooding that occurred in 1955 which really spurred the council the state government the feds to implement this scheme but it 's mind-boggling 160 kilometers of levee and it 's protected that a number of the townships there in 1971 1977 2007 so it 's been there for a long time old substance down in Tasmania again this is another good example of a scheme that was completed earlier some quite some time ago and was starting to become structurally deficient due to old standards and codes and ongoing issues of not maintaining some components so they 've got in there and they 've actually reconstructed the scheme so it 's a 12 kilometer levee system completed in 2015 it 's only recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 2016 event which was quite a significant part of that down there I 'll get in front of everyone who 's going to ask the question about Lismore so it just will put the record straight with Liz more because the media did a pretty poor job to be honest around explaining what happened in Lismore the Liz more flood levee system was completed in 2000 2005 so it 's protected the CBD of Liz more in 2005 2007 2009 the cost of those three events alone has already paid for itself plus almost again with the levee system so it 's a three o 'clock three kilometer long levee system and it 's 20 was twenty million dollars and as all you 've probably know it overtopped in 2017 so that particular levee system was designed for a 10 percent annual exceedence probability so 10 percent every year you have a chance you get a flood greater than the levee system so it was a fairly low level of immunity offered by the Celebi it was what was affordable at the time and I 've just included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original design and showing that there were two spillway points to allow flow into town when there was an event larger than the levee was designed for and the photo on the bottom right is exactly what occurred and you can even see on their gauge they talked about with the community when it reaches a certain gauge height when levee overtopping will start to commence the levee did not fail it did not breach it did not give away its the overtopped which it was designed to do in events larger than what it was designed for in terms of design criterion standards there 's a number of relevant design guidelines and standards the one on the far left is really good news for the engineering industry the Queensland state government is now regulating levee banks and has been for a couple of years now it was something that was much needed to make sure that levees are designed to the to the right codes and requirements so there 's now a requirement for council as in this case to actually make application under the new levee regulations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet in order to achieve approval under those those regulations the Queensland levee guidelines make significant reference to the International levy handbook that 's been the work over five or six years from the International levee community across multiple governments to basically pull together the international best practice when it comes to levees and put that in one big guideline and that 's the particular guideline that 's been adopted for the south rockin side levee planning and design so probably just moving through the alignment because that 's probably the very first place to start first question that we always ask is well what are we trying to protect with this levee system so just to help everyone North arrows just here so this way and so the first question is we 've got obviously lower dorten Road everyone 's aware that yep and North and South have now been upgraded to provide immunity of the Bruce Highway into town but then diverting to up a Dawson Road so lower Dawson Road it 's a particular focus to try and protect that there 's also a number of businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then residential areas so this was the original alignment put forward in 1992 which Peter showed a bit of a map out of the study back then and that 's where we started with it with the study so as we work through this of things that that probably pop up for most people it did encompass the key infrastructure and the residential here and commercial buildings this is the key flow path and I 'll go through this a little bit more but this is the roundabout and this is going out through the yep and crossing and coming into town the flow through this throat here three or four north as we call it is significant it 's a very important flow path for the western floodplain the implications of the levee here causes the majority of the affects back upstream through the western floodplain and back to the airport and so the the alignment here the choice of the alignment is needs to be made very very carefully so that was a key issue was it old money to alignment that jutted out a bit and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time probably unknown back then but now we do know that it 's crossed right through the middle of a wetland here and not just any wetland that 's earth and one of national significance is a key wetland for the region and it also has significant cultural heritage values to the drum board people and so that 's that was a key issue with the original 1992 alignment crossing through there and we also had some interference with some fairly major overhead transmission lines coming in to rockhampton power regard so the study commenced with us looking at alignment options and so we generated a number of options which you can see there different pros and cons as always with this kind of infrastructure some people being left out some people being left in and obviously different costs as well associated with those different levy alignments the process then becomes a fairly rigorous one over about five or six months so what we looked at is on a number of different disciplines across our technical teams what are the pros and cons of each of those alignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and workshopping so we 've had a number of workshops with key stakeholders so we 're talking to state government inputs through a number of those and basically trying to arrive at what was the best balance with the selected levy alignment there 's always it 's always a balancing act with any of this kind of infrastructure what that left us was was the the selected alignment which you can see there so you 'll notice that we have we changed the alignment fairly significantly around around the Hastings so I we 've pulled it in tucked it in quite significantly and also incorporated so fairly important bends in the levee there to take the flow and divert it smoothly around that at the end of the levee we 've moved well away from that wetland and on to the fitters Street area and similarly with we 've pushed right over to Roselle Park and got around the back of the treatment plant before coming down the main strip down main down key Street so one of the key questions we get asked is what does it look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give an indication of what the system looks like in the different areas but we will show some apps later on which shows that in a bit more detail so this particular location that 's Walter Reed most people familiar with that landmark so around the Walter Reed Center particularly when we 're getting closer up key Street past Derby Street we 're looking at a full demand herbal stop log system which is the bottom system you can see the reason being is we don 't want any levee shown along the leavitt along the river bank there it 's a key location for the community and the visual impacts of a levee along there would be fairly horrendous so that particular system involves a footing that would be permanently there and then before flood events the stop log system would be erected when there 's the first warning a flooding came further down we also passed past Walter Reed we start to use a composite wall system as an example of that there where we have a small permanent wall levee which can then be have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra height that we require along that section of the riverbank so as we move further down the river I 'm particularly past the boat ramp to further down we we start to convert to a credible system so crude oil system is the same system used at Downing Street at kershel Gardens so again somewhere you could go and have a look at what it looks like but that 's the image there the top right out of Kershaw garments and that 's assistant I will use due to space constraints stuffs getting tight around that particular area down past the boat ramp so we 're using that from a space perspective when we do get that into the rural areas where we 've got more space we adopt the earth levee and so it 's fairly sort of stock standard we 'll talk a bit more detail around the specifics and the material properties and what 's required but we go and earth levee whiz and in this case we 're adopting a vinyl sheet pile on the top the intent of the volge vinyl sheet pile is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch on free build and what that means shortly but for the most part of the earth embankment grasped and in some some locations rock protected so we need to from velocities we do have a number of gates where we 're crossing existing roads and we also cross the North Coast rail line and require a gate structure there as well gates across roads and rails are done all the time and levee systems they 're nothing new in this particular place you can see a number of examples they 're both Australia Europe the US they 're done fairly frequently so ultimately it 's about bringing the levee in terminating on either side of the road or rail and again putting the mountable barrier in before the flood event arrives to actually close that opening up but in normal situations the levee will terminate either side of the road and rail and continue on with pump stations so we do have a few pump stations obviously we 'll talk again about those in a bit more detail top ones they 're just showing an exterior and interior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger pump station just to put that in perspective so we 're talking there a 30 cubic meter of second pump station so 30,000 litres a second so again we 'll put that in context as we go through but that is a much bigger pump station obvious intent of the pump station is to collect storm water if we do have a river flood occurring at the same time so collecting that storm water from the local runoff and rainfall and pumping that over the levee it 's again it 's a frequent frequently used bit of infrastructure for most levees we also have a number of backflow prevention devices that 's just an example I 've shown there there 's a number of different types different manufacturers and different uses and different conditions but basically put those back away prevention devices on existing stormwater outfalls again to prevent the river from backing up through our storm water network and flooding the interior side of the levee very similar to what 's been put out there for the north rocky scheme so again if you took a walk down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been installed as part of that scheme that 's just a quick snapshot doesn 't show all the technical jargon it 's just something fairly simple to see how the levees laid out in terms of configuration so again you can see north north up this way so if we just work our way so we connect in up at the the new jellyfish Street intersection on lower dorsum roads probably at the north project they 've raised that area there so there 's a connection of the levee there floodgate over the north coast rail line and then we work our way down again this is the key flow path right here and also obviously down the main river so we tied along this area here incorporate a couple of gates in this area as well to facilitate normal road access there 's a pump station located in proximity to the hastings site where we 're collecting storm water from this portion of the catchment we then turn out around fitters street so this is currently for the street along here we have an emergency spillway again we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pump station that 's actually our biggest pump station of the three I 'm in the fifth Street area with announcer Roselle Park protecting most of the sewage treatment plant around the corner here again we have a number of flood gates we have then a pump station on the main drain again we 'll go through that most be familiar with the main drain system that we 're pumping from there and you can see we do transition to a crib wall system so we 're going that retaining wall system due to space around the corner here and then we do transition back to earth and then ultimately we do go to our composite levee through that Wolfe Street area where we get types of space back to earth and then ultimately then the full heed amount of all systems through the main CBD area to ensure that there 's no visual impacts so in terms of just a summary of the configuration we will put again a bit of the technical behind this but that just gives a quick snapshot of the different elements we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that means and free board but at this stage it so it 's a 1% annual exceedence probability design criteria for the levee system which is equivalent to nine point six on the gauge for those familiar with with gage datum that incorporates that 0.9 meter free board quite significant probably one of the largest that any Queensland levy has got on it at the moment and we 'll explain why working through we then have a number of lovely types so you can see the breakdown of the levy types that we just discussed before ultimately earth levies use predominately 5.6 kilometers it 's the cheapest it 's the most effective and we use that wherever we can we do have transitions in between levy types and that 's that 's really important it 's a key consideration from a technical perspective about how you transition from one levy type to the other in history in history and time gone by they can be weak points and so there 's a lot of guidance around design of those transitions in terms of interior drainage management again we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detention basins one at fitters street one in Hastings 3 pump stations so again trying to put that in perspective you can see the the discharges Duty discharges there so you know think of a 1 liter milk container we 're talking 9,000 of those a second at 5th Street we 're talking 1,000 at Hastings and 3,000 when this is 2nd of the main drain Kollwitz we obviously have culverts to allow flow so where the river isn 't up and we just have a local storm event we want that that runoff to get through the levee system and so we have a number of culverts 13 that allow the flow through the levee and normal operation and each of those have backflow prevention to prevent the river from backing up through those culverts we do have some complementary works or Associated works for Lucius Street and Wall Street both stormwater drainage upgrades to actually facilitate interior drainage behind the levee and gets that water to the main drain then be pumped out there 's obviously a number of existing services which I go through all those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment requirements for those services like power gas electrical and then we have our emergency spillway so it 's a 400 meter long still way at the fifth Street or again we 'll talk in a bit more detail about that","(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

gentlemen it 's 30 and our forums about to begin just by way of introduction my name is Paul Bell I 'm a councillor in the central Holland Regional Council area rocky resident born and bred here and written I left in the rocky area about 1979 to go to Emerald so um it 's nice to be back here again yeah well back here every week but nice to be back here again to be here with you all for the several can 't inform levy for on this evening so welcome so what have you all here tonight 's an opportunity for us to hear more about where and the engineering and design phase of this project is gone and some of the most questions that people have been asking or being able to be looked at in a design sense and I think the supplement tonight we got the opportunity to have a nice little question-and-answer session later on by way of welcome of life of the Rockhampton City Council I would like to welcome you all here to have you all here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities are set for us to have a conversation about the the South Rock the flood project I 'd like to recognize the mayor it 's good to have you with us again Margaret I 'm motor and I 've certainly worked together on many platforms continuing to push for this great pilot Queensland and and it worked together for many many years and local government to the other councillors and rocky and rocky city councils that are here some of those will be looking after you all later on with their microphones but it 's good to see my fellow councillors here as well our federal member meshell Landry Michelle 's great to have you here and I was only about three weeks ago and catching up with Michelle and Kenny O 'Dowd and others some again promoting this great region so it 's so nice to see you back to you Michelle and and the certainly great to have you here with us this evening look there 's just a couple little things we need to sort of keep I think own mind bathrooms are out either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there are is any those fired noses the ones and whatever else we go through the same places through the exits this evening we will as I said will like they 'll be able to have an opportunity though to to sit around the auditorium and have a great discussion but to to start that that discussion let 's have an opportunity I think to listen to Ethel Hatfield from every speedy Ethel speedy not Hatfield that evil speedy from the rumble people and honey a thought it 's going to do I welcome to country thank you thank you to tamale man bigger dumb brother auntie bindi no ed no ago endured over year ago unum Callaghan Gary my name says of speedy but it will Hatfield that 's my younger sister earnest yes I Hatfield give it a look at them oh I thank you that maybe because with aid you mature and look better yes I 'd like to pay my respects to my elders my ancestors who passed on and I would like to acknowledge your elders and your ancestors arm that are present here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a kid I grew up along a picture a river because I lived a gambler for a lot of years I started school in the little country place called Millman now--they and used the Connelly mother up every Sunday to go down and have her swim in the river but we had to do our housework before we donate now I 've seen the changes in the river over the years because I grew up got married and lived out there again but again when they put the garages at the barrage when they put the barrage up there but before when I was young we used to swim there all day and to the point where our skin was lily-white and wrinkled you know because we were and eyes was red ass because of its wagon in the river and you could throw a white pebble about three or four meters and we used to dive down and get the white pebble pick the white pebble up and bring it up to the service you know as kids we could dive deep and we could do these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for the simple reason the river got really dirty and it just backed up and and it it was really a big change and it was I wasn 't really impressed at it but you know there was a purpose for that branch and I know that this session here this evening is about the flood levee and this is serious matter because when you change the system of the river you change the whole environment around it so and I 'm sorry but I 'm 71 years of age and I 've lived on the river and I 've seen the changes and I pray to my Great Creator that the decision you make about the flood levee will be for the better for everyone around I 've lived here through the Cyclones through the floods and I 've seen what 's happened and I must apologize I did not acknowledge our mayor margaret 's Trillo and have had to remember I 'm very sorry for that but I just wanted to let you know about my story as an indigenous person our spirit is within the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you must welcome I know that a lot of years would 've lived around this area most of your lives some may have just moved here but others have lived here most of their lives but the rumble people have walked along that feature a river for thousands of years not just two hundred thousands so I think I 've said enough and if I said the wrong thing I don 't give permission for you to shoot [Laughter] thank you very much for listening thank you fo for those wise words and they wonderful welcome to the country look there 's a little couple things that might be going on in the first five or ten minutes media are going to be here maybe taking some little back shots from up the back there might be some both print and TV media moving around but I think as per the rules of the house some that will just peek around that first ten minutes there will be other media here during the day of the forum but as I said the the vision will be be short-lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about those first ten minutes the only other thing of what to say Nia was it done we 're in for two lovely welcomes one from Michelle Landry a local member and then followed by Margaret Taylor Army acai please welcome Michelle Landry just to give us who welcome please thanks very much Paul and I too would like to acknowledge mayor Margaret Strehlow and rocky regional counselors here today and ladies and gentlemen thank you everyone for coming along tonight I don 't want to say too much because the forum is about letting you hear from the experts and asking your questions I would like to thank Rockhampton Regional Council for holding the forum and understanding that there are a lot of concerns blood mitigation is important for everyone we want our region to prosper and not be hamstrung by the negativity and impacts of flooding however it is important that in finding a solution we don 't create additional headaches and heartache for others so tonight I urge everyone to listen to the answers with an open mind we have listened to your concerns and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can share the courtesy as always please feel free to contact my office if you wish to discuss this further thank you thank you very much Michelle and now without a further ado I just asked um how many means trilogy you got to come in to do a brief op here mo thank you and I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land and I pay my respects to their elders past present and future acknowledge Michelle Landry acknowledged the counselors most importantly I acknowledge those in our community who have come to hear firsthand but the detail of this extraordinary piece of engineering that we plan to build you won 't hear anything new the studies were completed a few years ago and the reports have been on our website in one form or another and in the public domain for a long time but hopefully this evening is an opportunity to hear in one sitting from the experts directly and with hopefully good visuals and explanations to join the dots of the project this is our once in a generation opportunity what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the state government what has been contributed and committed by local government adds up to 60 million dollars now we 've also got a commitment from the federal opposition but they 're not in government so we really do need support from our federal member they proposed 25 million dollars that we are asking from the federal government is about what is usually allocated every year for the whole of Australia for flood mitigation so it is a huge ask and the fact that it wasn 't shut down straight away by the by the prime minister or Barnaby Joyce gives us an extraordinary opportunity that won 't come again the levy studies have been detailed and thorough it is an ambitious project but oddly it Sachs very logical levy to build it is able to accommodate a detention basin and three separate pump stations a luxury that many levees just don 't have we have the room to do this and to do it well this levee is a landmark proposal which will change the future of our city if we had the courage to grab hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boundaries of the old Rocky City 13% floods between the north Rockhampton levee already done the next hundred houses in the north rock anthems that will be 500 out of North Rockhampton this proposal here that we 're discussing this evening and some other bits and pieces of fill and valves and whatever that we know we can do each one that picks up a few here and a few there we can address about 70% of the properties that flood in this city hopefully by the time the experts are finished you 'll understand it 's not an arbitrary thing we didn 't kind of go and I think the use of the temporary levee confused people a little they thought we just picked somewhere to put it as a whole lot of science around it I wish we can protect every property so there is science there is hydrology you have a much better understanding of that by the end of today some of you here have come with your mind 's made up and there is nothing that we can say that will change your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of hands the people who are in that category okay can I ask you please to just to listen and and respect that there are other people here and I 'll thank you there were so few of you so if you can respect that others who are here this evening are here too and and their mind is still open and they 're keen to hear what the experts have got to say I thank you for your openness I commend this work to you and I really look forward to watching for myself as the whole project gets put together in one one sitting so thank you and welcome [Applause] thanks Margaret well we just suppose the forum proper will be a will look an opportunity for you to hear from from two or three speak groups of speakers and there will be a little opportunity to hear about the history and background which will be from our council engineer Peter Coe furred and then followed by the aecom team who are here and then people just gives a little bit of a finish off and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to have about thirty minutes of questions at your time then in turn then to ask questions so we really would hope that you are able to focus your questions on the presentation on the forum and and I think you know just if you have other ideas and other options and other things that are away from the forum and the intent of what 's being presented tonight there 's lots of opportunities for you to be able to present those either the council to aecom and others in your packs you 'll see websites contacts and other arrangements you can make to directly provide those alternatives or options directly to to any of the team from RCC or from home so that 's a little bit about the how I think we 'll the forum will move forwards this evening here it is it 's all up there and then that 's a bit about some and how we should move forward our forward presenters this evening are of course Peter Peter Kofi to Peter if you understand just this really quickly Peter some regional services are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 20 years and Peters very experienced executive manager in local government and currently has that that regional manager regional services rocky City Council so this is very much his baby from the a comm team Bend McMaster then if you like to stand or but you have bending so locally I know his mum Wells he works also chair the board of the HH s therapy hospital board and month his mum works up there and she 's very strong part of their team so but hear all about her then tonight we 'll hear more from them Ben 's the principal engineer with extensive experience certainly in hydrology hydraulics and flood risks does a lot of work in that area and has been I think of animal principles in both the emeral levy feasibility study which I know a lot about and also with the other Southampton flood levee project as well the other members of Ben 's team Brian Wright who 's the industry director for water for a calm of heparin and lots of places and Ryan as the the engineer with that I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37 years experience in water and Sybil so extensive experience there and he has led and participated in various studies particularly in urban areas and design projects on floodplains right throughout regional Queensland iced over here Brian and Robert Burke so Robert is a Geo sucio technical guys and he 's their lead for Northern Territory and North Queensland for aecom geotech our guys are really important when it comes to tying these things into the ground and and how they will work and how the system itself operates if you if you have a levee is the pokies they 're certainly the icons practice leader 20 years experience and he 's managed many geo technical analytics and designed for for lots of levees around including the South Rockhampton levee and also the Emerald levee as well so look that 's our pedal they 'll be there for your questions as well when question times comes but firstly I just like to peer ask you would you like to take the microphone or lead us through the project history please welcome Peter [Applause] okay good afternoon ladies and gentlemen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run through such a comprehensive project and make sure everyone can understand where we 're up to and what we think we can achieve by this project being implemented the first part of my presentation is about the history of developing an understanding of the Fitzroy River it 's obviously a massive River very complex and it 's been studied over many years I 'm also going to talk about what has been done over the years to reduce flood risks in the in that catchment and in Rockhampton but specifically and the last part is about really about how do you go forward managing flood risks in Rockhampton go back okay this slide is just to show you the amount of studies that have been done on this catchment most people in this room would know there was some major floods in 1911 and there was a number of floods that kept occurring but it wasn 't till the 1960s when actually more links started to occur in this catchment typically to those studies you looked up there it was prompted by another flood and people said we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to understand the river better and we need to address the flood risks in our community the most significant one where really it was all wrapped up in a 1 review of history was 1992 so the next slide was in 1992 major it was there was a major flood event in 1991 that prompted this study of 1992 was done by the waters Resources Commission in this of Queensland and as you can see it was funded by the federal government it was undertaken out 18 months one of the most major studies ever done on the catchment it detailed and reviewed all the options to mitigate risk for Rockhampton and you 'll see that there 's a things called structural and non-structural and I 'll talk about them a little bit later and it was the most detailed risk assessment have occurred to date what that study identified is some key things it had two priority areas the first highest priorities were the yep and crossing the second was the South rocking flood levee the third was the airport levee and then there was splitters Creek levee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dams Weir 's it looked at diverting sideways dredging the river a buyback scheme for the properties that were affected and also raising the pink level every really break out and what 's important is this is the first map that actually displayed the flood mitigation scheme so this is back in 1992 and you 'll see on the right-hand side there they 're both labeled priority one one is the Epping crossing and the second is the South Rockhampton side levee the priority two and three areas was be important and the splitters Creek and north Rockhampton was fall so some 25 years ago it was first presented as the option go to the next slide this just shows that Levy and that was the layout proposed back in 1992 and you 'll see later on how that 's been revisited and refined over time so that was 1992 and as you would have saw on earth those slides earlier there 's been many other studies and it got to a point where the council then basically got and said we 're going to develop its own slow-play management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the strategy when adopted actually set the same priorities so it was still yep and Crossing North Rockhampton was jumped up and I 'll explain why and the South Rockhampton levy was still up there at the top so this shows the phases very clear we were fortunate enough to have the yep and Crossing completed there 's been there was not achieved for funding that brought forward the North Rockhampton flood mitigation scheme as we 've said previously the South Rockhampton suddely has been fully designed there was some initial high level feasibility work done on the airport splitters Creek and there are other ongoing projects across the city that we are studying right now okay flooding is about not solving it it 's about magic managing the risk right around Australia communities are built on floodplains typically beside rivers because it was a very logical and practical thing to do for a whole range of reasons part of flood mitigation is about minute minimizing and reducing risks and there 's three risks that we deal with inside mitigation I 'll go I 'll jump to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the risk that you can never remove is just not feasible and the only way to manage that is through disaster management and being having a community aware it 's flood risks and being prepared the future risk rock Hamptons done a lot of work in this area it 's about fun policy it 's about planning rules it 's about making sure you don 't put any more people within the floodplain at risk the last component is existing risk and really this is what the South Fork and from flood level what living is about it 's about the existing buildings and the development that 's in the front plane at risk and the only way to solve it is through a structural measure and this is just another way of looking at it though so land use planning and site policy keeps people away from the water structural which is like the levee is keeping water away from the people those other areas which I talked about before which is development and planning which is reducing risks for people who live in homes it 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them away from those high velocity areas and the last as I said is about disaster management so where are we at the moment Council made a commitment in 2013 to investigate the levees it set money aside in its budget it sought funding from federal and state government and was successful in achieving that as it says they 're 1.4 four or five million has been spent on the feasibility and design of the South Rockhampton living 416,000 has been provided by each state in federal the study was completed in 21 months and he shows the phases so the initial phase is about modeling and it 's effectively understanding the flows the depths and how the floodplain behaves it looks at the options and you 'll see some more of that in the presentation first who was preliminary design and as it says there in October 2014 the final design was prepared that included detailed drawings of the proposal the alignment and also had prepared estimates and had done a review of environmental considerations so they are just a snapshot of the investigations that were undertaken as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see drainage and hydraulics the most fundamental that 's what we need to understand before we can move forward then we talk about environmental heritage geotechnical analysis civil design visual amenity the impact on services transport and ultimately then the cost estimate and economic evaluation back then the project objectives were to develop a levee system which will protect low-lying areas of Rockhampton occupied by homes businesses schools parks and infrastructure from major flood events not all events but major flood events to a certain level improve the flood immunity of the Bruce Highway but lower Dawson Lance Road which is which back then was still also looking for that construction of the yep and crossing the other objective was to minimize adverse impacts of the levee visual amenity hydraulics environmental impacts on our existing infrastructure and minimize resumption for that corridor I 'm now going to hand over to Ben 's he 's going to run through the technical presentation that it 's been undertaken by AECOM thank you thanks Peter well firstly just yeah lots of thank you very much for coming along tonight it 's not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of engineers to explain what we 've been doing for the last three years but it really apreciate around time to come along and listen to us we 're very happy introductions but I 'm joined by Brian and Rob so we 'll both do a bit of handing over just to to cover the technical aspects of the project so I 'd like to start with our role so a lot of people are too are a con so we 've operated an office here in North Hampton for about 17 years we have 30 local staff but we 're much bigger beasts than that I guess if you 're looking at a global perspective so you can see the graphic they 're in a lot of countries we have a lot of staff and we do this kind of work fairly regularly with flood mitigation projects so it 's just a few of examples this is some work that we have been doing international sort of projects but also some projects locally as well one on the left is actually a major flood pumping station and floodgate got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing gate and then we 've got some earth levees there as well so just gives a snapshot sometimes of our role so we were engaged by council and ultimately we were there to assess the technical feasibility of the South rocky flood levee project our role is to provide independent advice and technical analysis we 're not here to stay with the levee should proceed or not we 're here to give all the informations for ultimately you to make that decision there 's a lot of guidelines and technical standards that that surround levees now levees are a major service fee structure projects and so we have to align to those as engineers we also have obtained inputs from a range of stakeholders throughout the design process and overall its River sea but we 're going to be talking for about 100 technical specialists from a common we 've been involved on this project both in Australia and the US so I 'll just quickly step through a few key definitions because we 've we will talk about this throughout tonight and probably in the QA as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a slide shortly just to explain that most people I 'm pretty sure I 'm aware of what a levy is we will talk about average annual damage and so that 's the cost the long-term annual cost to the community and the economy due to flood damage and so when we do economic evaluations of levies that 's something that we look at we look at what was the damage before annually and what is it afterwards that we can see how that levy performs efflux is another key term that 's used fairly regularly some will be aware of that but our flux is basically where we put an obstruction in a flow path we have an increase in water level upstream of that obstruction normally a decrease in flood levels downstream so when we 're talking about a flux that 's what we 're referring to benefit cost ratio is another one which will also be discussed tonight so basically that 's a ratio between economic benefits of a project and costs so when the BCR is above one that 's normally an indication that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the key one which I 'll cover is annual exceedence probability now when we come to do risk assessments and flood studies and studies of major river systems and as engineers we always talk about annual exceedence probability so that 's the chance that you would have a flood as equal to or greater than that in a given year so some people would have heard the Q 100 or 100 year flood that 's used fairly regularly we won 't be saying that tonight it 's it 's a it 's a terminology that can be misunderstood by the community and some people think if you 've had a 1 in 100 year floods you won 't have that for another 100 years that 's just not the case statistically what we 'd prefer to say is you 've got a 1% chance of that happening each year Emerald 's a good example so emerald had a a major flood in 2008 which was one in 70 year flood and then they followed that in two years later and had a 130 year flood so I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's just our goes so in terms of levees as a flood mitigation option as Peter mentioned there 's a range of different options and levies aren 't always the answer levees are used in particular circumstances where it warrants them but if the levee is a central option then what we look normally looking at is raised predominator the embankments however there are other types of levees which I 'll go through as well just in terms of how how they get used around the world so it 's about 48,000 kilometers in the u.s. that the US Army Corps knows about they expect that there 's another 150,000 kilometers that they don 't have documented and that 's across 12 almost 12,000 different systems so the statistics are pretty mind-boggling you 've got two-thirds of the US population is behind a levee over there so it 's frequently used there 's several hundred thousand kilometres then when you sum that up with the US and Europe and even in Australia we 've got seven several hundreds of several thousand kilometres use in Australia so they are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worthwhile just doing a quick snapshot these aren 't all the levees but these are some some key ones this is in Rocky this is in our backyard so this is the Darling Street levee Kershaw Gardens for those familiar with that area so it 's an 800 meter long crib wall system so that particular levee was put in place in 2016 protects about 20 homes you could see on the left that was before construction on the right after construction and this was it during the flood so we just add it 's a bit hard to see but that 's the levee running around here so everyone knows about this or those locals familiar with the area so this is our North Rockies flood mitigation scheme Stage one of the scheme now there 's a bit of background to this project in terms of planning but the works for this project isn 't just the barrier that 's what people saw but prior to this there was a significant amount of backflow prevention works done on the storm water out leading to Lakes Creek Road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent ingress from flood water back through the sewer what went hand-in-hand with this is then temporary flood barrier which was about 380 meters long that was rolled out on Ellison rod with Street and we had a number of temporary pump stations set up as well at key points to collect any minor seepage that occurred and pump that back over so I know a lot of people would have seen those out and about with the trucks pumping some of those flows back over so that 's you can see the the system set up and then bottom left during the flood probably the better ones are actually these so these are the actual aerial imagery showing what actually occurred during the peak of the flood we 've had this year so cover this one here so for those not aware the lakes Creek Road is actually is actually a high point all the way along and we do that that system in itself formed as a levee so the road and rail there are higher than the flood line all the way up to a 1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flood protection offered by Lakes Creek Road the issue we 've had previously is that the rivers gone through the storm water pipes backed up into the area in behind Lakes Creek Road and slided those properties and it 's also come back up around the creek and in undated back through that way as well this is a backward area of the floodplain and with those backflow prevention devices on the road and with the barrier which you can see and it 's feel the shots there we can actually particularly this one that 's where the river came up around the creek and we cut it off by the barrier and protected the homes in here so about 400 properties protected with this stage one of the scheme and stage two of the scheme is to ultimately move that barrier further down and protect more properties and move down to Water Street but Water Street requires reconstruction in order to achieve that so that 's that 's a future stage of the scheme and all the neighbors up in Makai some acquires had I had a flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a mixed type system so they have earth levees that have vertical flood walls I have crib walls very very similar actually to the South Rocky flood levee proposed here longer than ounce 13 kilometers and across seven different levee type levee systems you can see on both sides of the Pioneer River so that system has been in yes since the 1970s it 's protected Makai on numerous occasions 2008 2010 and even in some of the recent flooding we 've had this year charville most people will probably wear this one as well so completed in 2009 upgraded slightly in 2013 it 's protected against three a lot of instance construction again it 's a combination so you 've got some earthly components we 've got gate crossings across the roads like we 'll have here and some temporary barrier as well and some vertical walls so that 's another example of a flood levee system used in in rural Queensland 20 million dollar cost and after that one Suncorp have done some assessments so average sheer insurance premiums 990 a year down to 400 after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already after what 's that about eight years so you go to the Hunter Valley the Hunter Valley scheme is enormous so it 's got 160 kilometres of sub levee in the Hunter we 've got there 's five basins three school way overflow points and basically it was the flooding that occurred in 1955 which really spurred the council the state government the feds to implement this scheme but it 's mind boggling 160 kilometers of levee and it 's protected that a number of the townships there in 1971 1977 2007 so it 's been there for a long time all systems down in Tasmania again this is another good example of a scheme that was completed earlier some quite some time ago and was starting to become structurally deficient due to old standards and codes and ongoing issues of not maintaining some components so they 've got in there and they 've actually reconstructed the scheme so it 's a 12 kilometer levy system completed in 2015 it 's only recently and that 's a 60 million dollar project which protected in the 2016 event which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of everyone who 's going to ask the question about Lismore so just we 'll put the record straight with Liz more because the media did a pretty poor job to be honest around explaining what happened in Lismore the Lismore flood levee system was completed in 2000 2005 so it 's protected the CBD of Liz mall in 2005 2007 2009 the cost of those three events alone has already paid for itself plus almost again with the levee system so it 's a three o 'clock three kilometer long levee system and it 's 20 was twenty million dollars and as all you probably know it overtopped in 2017 so that 's the TfL levee system was designed for a 10-person annual exceedence probability so 10% every year you have a chance you get a flood greater than the levee system so with a fairly low level of immunity offered by the Celebi it was what was affordable at the time and I 've just included up here at the top right that 's actually the original designs and showing that there were two spillway points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than the levee was designed for and the site on the bottom right is exactly what occurred and you can even see on that gauge they talked about with the community when it reaches a certain gauge height when levee overtopping will start to commence the levee did not fail it did not breach it did not give away its the overtopped which it was designed to do in events larger than what it was designed for in terms of design criteria and standards there 's a number of relevant design guidelines and standards the one on the far left is really good news for the engineering industry the Queensland state government is now regulating levee banks and has been for a couple of years now it was something that was much needed to make sure that levies are designed to the to the right codes and requirements so there 's now a requirement for council as in this case to actually made application under the new levy regulations and there 's specific guidelines and requirements that levies have to meet in order to achieve approval under those those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International levy handbook that 's been the work over five or six years from the International levy community across multiple governments to basically pull together the international best practice when it comes to levies and put that in one big guideline and that 's the particular guideline that 's been adopted for the south rocking flood levee planning and design so probably just moving through the alignment because that 's probably the very first place to start first question that we always ask is well what are we trying to protect with this levee system so just to help everyone North arrows this year so north this way and so the first question is we 've got obviously lower dorten Road everyone 's aware that yep in north and south have now been upgraded to provide immunity of the Bruce Highway into town but then diverting to up a Torsen roads so lower Dawson Road is a particular focus to try and protect that there 's also a number of businesses shown in Orange Park schools and infrastructure in blue and then residential areas so this was the original alignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map out of the study back then and that 's where we started with it with the study first as we work through this there 's a number of things that that probably pop up for most people it did encompass the key infrastructure and the residential hair and commercial buildings this is a key flow path and I 'll go through this in a bit more but this is the roundabout and this is going out through the yep and crossing and coming into town the flow through this throat here through yep and north as we call it is significant it 's a very important flow path for the Western floodplain the implications of the levee here causes the majority of the effects back upstream through the western floodplain and back to the airport and so the the alignment here the choice of the alignment is needs to be made very very carefully so that was a key issue was it old money to alignment is it shut it out a bit and that wasn 't going to be good from a hydraulics perspective at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's crossed right through the middle of a wetland here and not just any wetland that 's and one of national significance it 's a key wetland for the region and it also has significant cultural heritage values to the drum ball people and so that 's that was a key issue with the original 1992 alignment crossing through there and we also had some interference with some fairly major overhead transmission lines coming in to rockhampton power and going so the study commenced with us looking at alignment options and so we generated a number of options which you can see there different pros and cons as always with this kind of infrastructure some people being left out some people being left in and obviously different costs as well associated with those different levy alignments the process then becomes a fairly rigorous one over about five or six months so what we looked at is on a number of different disciplines across our technical teams what are the pros and cons of each of those alignments and then we basically run through a process of scoring and workshopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholders we 're talking state government inputs through a number of those and basically trying to arrive at what was the best balance with the selected levy alignment there 's always always a balancing act with any of this kind of infrastructure what that left us was was the the selected alignment which you can see there so you 'll notice that we have we changed the alignment fairly significantly around around the Hastings so we 've pulled it in tucked it in quite significantly and also incorporated some fairly important bends in the levy there to take the flow and divert it smoothly around that at the end of the levy we 've moved well away from that wetland and on to the fitters street area and similarly with we 've pushed right over to Roselle Park and right around the back of the treatment plan before coming down the main strip down banks and down Keys trees so one of the key questions we get asked is what does it look like so I 've try to use some photos here just to give an indication of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will share some apps later on which shows that in a bit more detail so this particular location that 's well to read most people familiar with with that landmark so around the Walter Reed Center particularly when we 're getting closer up key Street past Derby Street we 're looking at a full demand herbal stop log system which is the bottom system you can see their reason being is we don 't want any levy shown along the leavitt along the riverbank there it 's a key location for the community and the visual impacts of a levee along there would be fairly horrendous so that particular system involves a footing that would be permanently there and then before flood events the stop log system would be erected when there 's a first warning a sliding cam further down we also passed past Walter Reed we start to use a composite wall system so as an example of that there where we have a small permanent wall levee which can then be had the the panel system incorporated on top just to give that extra height that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move further down the river I 'm particularly out past the boat ramp and further down we we start to convert to a credible system so crib all system is the same system used at Dowling Street at Kershaw Gardens so again somewhere you could go and have a look at what it looks like but that 's the image there the top right out of Kershaw balance and that 's a system I will use due to space constraints stuff getting tight around that particular area down past the boat ramp so we 're using that from a space perspective when we do get that into the rural areas where we 've got more space we adopt the levee and so it 's fairly sort of stock standards we 'll talk a bit more detail around the specifics and the material properties and what 's required but we go and oh fluffy with and in this case we 're adopting a vinyl sheet pile on the top the intent of old vinyl sheet pile is purely just to provide the freeboard and again I 'll touch on freeboard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth embankment grasped and in some some locations rock protected so we need to from velocities we do have a number of gates where we 're crossing existing roads and we also cross the North Coast rail line and require a gate structure there as well gates across roads and rails are done all the time and levee systems they 're nothing new in this particular case you can see a number of examples are both australia europe west they 're done fairly frequently so ultimately it 's about bringing the levee in terminating on either side of the road or rail and again putting the mountable barrier in before the flood event arrives to actually close that opening up but in normal situations the levee will terminate either side of the road and rail and continue on with pump stations so we do have a few pump stations obviously we 'll talk again about those in a bit more detail top ones there 's just showing an exterior and interior of a pump station we 've designed recently that 's a speaker pump stations just to put that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of second pump station so 30,000 litres a second so again we 'll put that in context as we go through but that is a much bigger pump station obvious intent of the pump station is to collect stormwater if we do have a river flood occurring at the same time so collecting that storm water from the local runoff and rainfall and pumping that over the levee it 's again it 's a frequent frequently used bit of infrastructure for most levees we also have a number of backflow prevention devices that 's just an example I 've shown there there 's a number of different types are different manufacturers and different uses and different conditions but basically put those back away prevention devices on existing stormwater outfalls again to prevent the river from backing up through our storm water network and flooding the interior side of the levee very similar to what 's been put out there for the north rocky scheme so again if you took a walk down Lakes Creek Road you see a number of these that have been installed as part of that scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the technical jargon it 's just something fairly simple to see how the levees laid out in terms of configuration so again you can see north north up this way so if we just work our way so we we connect in up at the the new jellify Street intersection on lowered or some roads probably yet the north project they 've raised that area there so there 's a connection of the levee there floodgate over the north coast rail line and then we work our way down again this is the key flow path right here and also obviously down the main river so we tied along this area here incorporate a couple of gates in this area as well to facilitate normal road access there 's a pump station located in proximity to the hastings site where we 're collecting storm water from this portion of the catchment we then turn out around fitters street so this is currently for the street along here we have an emergency spillway again we 'll talk what that all means in this location here and a pump station that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in the fifth Street area within our Surrey Roselle Park protecting most of the sewage treatment plant around the corner here again we have a number of flood gates we have then a pump station on the main drain again we 'll go through that most be familiar with the main drain systems that we 're pumping from there and you can see we do transition to a crib wall system so we 're going that retaining wall system due to space around the corner here and then we do transition back to earth and then ultimately we do go to our composite levee through that Wolfe Street area where we get type of space back to earth and then ultimately then the fully demand herbal system through the main CBD area to ensure that there 's no visual impacts so in terms are just a summary of the configuration we 'll put again a bit of the technical behind this but that just gives a quick snapshot of the different elements we 'll talk shortly about design immunity of the levee and what that means and three ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probability design criteria for the levee system which is equivalent to nine point six on the gage for those familiar with gage datum that incorporates that 0.9 meter free board it 's quite significant probably one of the largest that any Queensland levy has got on it at the moment and we 'll explain why working through we then have a number of lovely types so you can see the breakdown of the levee types that we just discussed before ultimately earth levees used predominantly 5.6 kilometers if the cheapest it 's the most effective and we use that wherever we can we do have transitions in between levee types and that 's that 's really important it 's a key consideration from a technical perspective about how you transition from one let me type to the other in history in history and time gone by they can be weak points and so there 's a lot of guidance around design of those transitions in terms of interior drainage management again we 'll talk a bit more about this but we have two detention basins one at fitters Street one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in perspective you can see the discharges Duty discharges there so you know think of a one liter milk container we 're talking 9,000 of those a seconds add fitters Street we 're talking 1,000 at a sings and 3,000 when this and of the main drain kovetz we obviously have culverts to allow flow so where the river isn 't up and we just have a local storm event we want that that runoff to get through the levee system and so we have a number of culverts 13 that allow the flow through the levee in normal operation and each of those have backflow prevention to prevent the river from backing up through those culverts we do have some complementary works or Associated works for Lucius Street and Wall Street both stormwater drainage upgrades to actually facilitate interior drainage behind the levee and gets that water to the main drain then be pumped out there 's obviously a number of existing services so I go through all those in detail now but there 's a number of protection and treatment requirements for those services like power gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 400 meter long still way of fitter Street or again we 're talking a bit more detail about that so that 's me for now I 'll hand over to rob and I 'll let him to cover the geotech considerations [Applause] good evening everybody I 'm going to give a relatively brief overview of the geotech condition especially after that first start as you can see here the the ground conditions along the alignment our alluvial and alluvial earth flood born deposits easily comprising of sands and clothes this is borne out by the findings of the investigations that have been undertaken so between the lower Dawson Road to 5th Street you can see there 's what 's been identified to date has been a thin stratum of surface clay and Elaine by clay gravels and fans generally that alignment the based on the embankment arrangements is definitely suitable for carrying the loads the embankment and with expected moderate seepage to occur primarily underneath the beneath the clay capping whereas for 5th Street to fitzroy bridge there 's a thicker up 6 meter stiff clay underlined by clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but however because of the thicker clay deposits there seepage potential it 's worth noting that there are some softer firm clay layers at depth and there will be a little bit of consolidation of some of the embankments which has been accounted for in the design soft consolidating soils basically have the ability to basically reduce it in in size due to the loads placed due to groundwater being squeezed out of the soil structure I 'll just flip on to what some of the ground investigations were undertaken there are three grand investigations have been undertaken the count were extremely proactive and undertaking the first investigation before the commencement is the design which basically followed the alignment of the original the first option alignment that was very helpful in determining additional works and investigations which was staged thereafter which comprised geophysics and then borehole probes test pits and cone penetrometer testing to supplement that Institute testing to determine expected permeability ie the groundwater seepage is going to travel through the soil was undertaken in the field to give us more accurate representation of the ground models as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embankments are built in particular from soil and finding a source that would meet the expected four hundred thousand cubic meters of soil required to build the levee were required and therefore the great smear site was looked at after reviewing some other alternatives the great smear site was found to provide suitable material for our embankments which is comprised of a core core Center with less more permeable material on the outer flanks some treatment would be required but the proximity and location seem to provide value to the project as part of the design we go through four I 'll just go through with the embankments we look at stability and we look at seepage the picture on the left hand side is a steady state seepage analysis and this is when all the ground embankment becomes saturated and basically the contours that can be seen there from red going down to blue is the pressures and the velocities of the war of the groundwater going or the flood water passing through the living and down below the levee and as you can see the pressures dissipate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trenches and drainage system on the dry side could we just keep your question to the to the side because we have a question and answer period back and so I 'll just finish the presentation if we could just write down that question there will be opportunity in your bags as an SMS number as well when it 's just we 're really conscious of timing but we 'll definitely try to give you an answer during the the next stage so basically after assessing the seepage potential the flow past that was what goes into determining pumps how to collect the water and how the hydraulics is managed stability is another aspect of the embankment to ensure that during what 's called a rapid drawdown state which is usually the most critical state for an embankment a soil embankment is when it 's saturated and waters up against it up against the side on the leeward side or the web side of the levee when that water drop that water wallets at its maximum height actually provides stabilizing force and what occurs is when the flood levee drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be susceptible to instability and the stability ensures the long term performance and behavior of the embankment and this also carried out to confirm compliance with all those specifications so from all that information that seeds into the other design teams that evaluate the hydraulics the requirements for pumps so I 'll pass over to my colleague Brian to discuss the other all structures associated with the project just a quick note that during questions we certain more than happy to put the slides back up if people got a specific question about the slide so feel free to do so just in terms of the civil and structural design as Rob mentioned we we gather a whole lot of information from the geotech side from the hydrology in the hydraulics and we obviously develop the engineering components of the of the delivery system there 's certainly some lidar data was originally and then site survey specific site survey along the route was undertaken we developed from that then we developed our type cross-sections and has been mentioned before there 's basically three types as an earth levee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at property access arrangements including turnaround areas some gates access roads etc and we don 't preceded the structural design of the gates which is Mason basically either concrete or steel structural zones just as an indication the average height is about 2.8 meters the levee but it does vary from about 0.3 up to about five point eight meters high so and obviously at the end of all that we ended up with producing some detailed zone drawings and the documentation that goes with that whoops fasten fingers so I won 't go into too much detail other than to show that there 's basically three I think different types of earth levees is two on this side on another slide there 's the vertical temporary look at my bleep mother whoops sorry we go fat fingers out of the rat so okay did the light do it there it is so the crest for the earth levy it 's got a crest width of 4 meters and effectively that is for access but it also there 's widening widened areas for turnarounds and for passing it could comprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay zone on the outside and this is around I guess optimization and materials but more importantly the stability of the structure it 's got sea peach pits at the ends here that you can see so that relieves the pore pressure from the water the different types sections are basically to suit the different ground conditions coming back to what I was saying before so this is the temporary levee that been mentioned before so there 's basically a footing in the ground and the temporary livery is erected as we go and this is the composite levee which has got a footing and an extension concrete extension above ground and then the temporary levee goes up above that and that 's because the height of that is too high for a temporary levy alone and I guess what the other one is just to mention that in this top one there is some rock protection on some areas of the the outer embankment where the flood velocities higher that needs to protect the living and then again this is the composite levee down here sorry that wasn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also about visual amending very quickly and that 's that it 's a very high-level study assessment it 's looking at greening areas I just saw I 'm getting them not to say we 've got to keep moving quickly so so I guess there 's some prefer the work that we 've done in terms of that a visual amenity and on a fan back over to Bent Creek thanks Brian all right we 're getting pressed for time so what I 'll do is I 'll flip through some slides here and we will put them up when it comes to Q and X I 'm sure you 're all going to ask questions that we 'll all probably have some information more or hopefully the environment heritage protection I won 't cover this in detail more dissipates being assessed in terms of planning approvals and cultural heritage requirements and there 's some information on the screen there which you can probably see and again that 's all the reports are on councils website around the environment assessments right drainage hydraulics so probably a key question for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to try and be quick and again come back to this and show more information if you need firstly interior with exterior flooding is two separate issues here with levees and the bottom hopefully shows that so when we have exterior flooding we 're talking the Fitzroy River when we 're talking interior talking the South audience and local catchment which can flood as well behind the Libby how I go through this most are aware Fitzroy River catchment one hundred forty two thousand square kilometres second biggest catchment to the east coast of Australia and large flows there 's probably only other things so 16 2002 mix or greater that bottom left probably just gives you a quick snapshot that that flows for the the previous notable flood events you can see 1918 s there big flows 18,000 cubic meters a second at the peak and you can see there 's a number of other events there alongside including our recent 2017 event total the flood behavior when we get flows greater than about seven thousand cubic meters a second down the river we get the waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure all of you aware of so how do we come and how do we look at a catchment side of the Fitzroy so in this case we 're fairly lucky we 've got over 100 years a gauge data upstream of rocky at the end the Waddell Bank in the gap and so we combine those records and we can look at flood peaks and volumes every floods different everyone 's aware of that but we can do statistical analysis of all those records to work out that best fit probability distribution which you can see on the right and that allows us to estimate flood frequency quantiles which are flows basically for different probability events then we turn to the hydraulic so we we have an indication of how much flow is coming down the river for different different annual exceedence probabilities and so then the hydraulic model then turns those flows into flood behavior and more high what extent what level what velocity would that water get to around the floodplain in this case it 's a two dimensional two flow model developed for the river to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn 't use for flood forecasting so if the flood forecasting in the last event was a little bit out that 's not this model that 's a model that bomb runs which takes a couple of hours if that this run this this model here runs for at four days three to four days so it 's a much more detailed model required that 's required for this for the UM the floodplain model covers four hundred forty square kilometers of flood plains seven hundred thousand grid cells to assess flooding and then when we produce these models we calibrate them to actual recorded flood heights and recorded velocities we make sure that the model can replicate conditions that occur during those flood flood events out of all the study that we 've been involved in this that this Fitzroy River is probably in the most extensively studied so the number of models that show good correlation between them couple animations here so you 're seeing side-by-side basically we 'll replay it if we have to befall do that during the Q&A so just a side by side simulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design height of a levy and so critically you can see the levy on the right here in yellow and if I go back if I 'm going to run again so initially everyone 's aware and you saw this recently is you have that back water come back up cave your Creek and into the Western floodplains those right coming across the floodplain probably saw a dirty water here clean water on the other side in the last flood that occurs initially and then the breakout occurs at the western a particularly and that slows then come back through the Epping crossing so slows particularly through here as I said earlier a critical in terms of levee because the levee has to take that flow around the corner this just go one more time the other critical flow path is obviously then down the main river channel and so the levee along here we 're positioning on the top bank away from the bankers as far as we practically can to get it away from constricting the river there is some slight constriction though that curves down particularly around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in some increase in heights particularly just north rocky area and that was a key reason why the north Rocky scheme the other project was brought forward was to try and offset the impacts that the south rocky levy would create so we can play the signal close again in Q&A if we need to why go through that that 's the peak flood depth for the for the one percent on I 'm live with six gauge height with the levee in place and you 've all seen this I 'm sure a fox max so do predicted differences with the levee being put in place what would occur what happens to the flooding so the area in green is obviously protected area that 's no longer wet and so again you can see that the key flow past being through the yet the north throat and also to some extent through the Western the yep and south area that area there where the levee comes out does call increasing slide Heights but you can see there and transitions back to about back to the airport so where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no change in flood behavior or height as a result of levee so basically once you get to around the airport you almost with you back to existing conditions prior to the levee in these areas here you can see the color coding here there 's increases in height most substantial increases is right upstream of this jump around Hastings increases in flood heights serve about 300 mils keeping in mind that 's in the lagoon area where flooding is already about three three to four meters in depth so it 's adding another three hundred mils on top of that in that area north rocky again you can see there 's slight increases in flooding but again the north rocky scheme Darling Street levee and north rocky scheme offsets that to large extent more zoomed in with some arrows so you can see again it backs up into this area first back up through the crossing and shortly you 'll see the turns around and we get the flow around Hastings and down the river obviously so again we 'll come back to these if a bit more zoomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so south so the the South Rocky local catchment obviously is in behind the levee it 's ten point eight square kilometers fairly reasonable sized catchment it 's mostly urbanized shorter critical duration so two to nine hours roughly storm duration will cause flooding in this particular catchment it 's fairly aging infrastructure as you 're aware so all the development and lesser storm water infrastructure and has had a number of recent floods the most most recent lesser extent in 2017 particularly 2008 there was a significant flood event in south rocky local catchment 2030 in the Australia Day event and also Marsh from 2015 to some extent so how do we do it how do we look at this so again we develop a model that 's common practice for the engineering industry to develop a numeric model to assess flood behavior again it 's a similar process determined flows simulate actual noland events and make sure that the model can replicate those conditions and then we simulate with and without the levee conditions what that all shows is that that and most people are aware who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the levee and that stormwater arriving at the levee most the time we see sunny day floods in Rocky and we have for a number of floods the 2008 is a good example where we didn 't where we had minor River levels up but we also had a local rain event occur over the south rocky catchment and that for a levee is where we would need to capture some of that storm water and pump it over the levee through the assessment what we 've concluded is that we need three conversations I 've said earlier 13 Kaba penetrations through the system with backflow prevention devices and storm water diversion works to complement the levee operations again this is just an extract for the model showing flood behavior so there 's already existing flood risk that most people are aware that the main flight paths comes down through the urban areas into the main drain system and the main drain comes down to the river there 's already existing issues here and also upstream the rail so the rail the key control and it 's actually subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at flood mitigation for the local catchment through this area the levee system the whole intent is to try and make sure we don 't make that any worse and to try and still capture those flows down it 's particularly fitted Street so you can see the significant storage that occurs down at the fitters streets or the lagoon areas and so that 's where I made your conversations it 's to collect that water and pump it over pumping also on the main drain and locks there down the Hastings so that 's the flood depth for the local catchment with the levee end and this is their assessment of the implications of what what the levee does if you do get that concurrent concurrent flooding so what we 've tried to do is is maximize obviously costs with pumping goes up as you choose greater and greater pumps so we 've tried to do an offset so we 've got pumping here here and down here and so we 've tried to optimize the pumping rates to ensure that any impacts that do occur here which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that aren 't populated so that we within open areas and not affecting existing buildings or floor for heights keeping in mind again and it needs to be very clear is that that 's up to the 1% design event now there may still be an event that occurs greater than that and everyone needs to be aware that that 's a risk with a levee that you have an interior rainfall event that exceeds the 1% and there would be some impact interior to a levee system I will scoot through this very quickly so risk management it 's in its inherent and everything we do in terms of engineering and so there 's a risk register being developed for this project in accordance with a levy international Levy handbook operations and maintenance so we 've got an O&M manuals operations and maintenance manual that we 've produced and an emergency response plan for the project this project is is it 's a major projects or require annual maintenance routine condition assessments inspections and in there and the like throughout its life current estimate is one hundred thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the project most will probably have seen the cost estimate so there 's a few assumptions there again we can flip back to this in the Q&A around what the the assumptions are on the estimates that 's the breakdown about 50 just to touch over 50 million in terms of real construction costs with principles obligations and contingency another nine a bit so total project of sixty million the economics that economics is obviously important as well in terms of justifying whether the project should proceed when we look at the economics for any flood mitigation project we have direct benefits and indirect benefits so director like you can figure those this year reduction and flood damages that occur because the levies in place we 're offsetting the need to invest in Lowell Dawson Road mmunity upgrade so it 's about forty million dollar project there to to upgrade lower Dawson Road eventually and then there 's other indirect benefits like reduction in insurance premiums that may occur inside the loaded area and also reduce business interruptions and the like with a levy on the flip side then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure and then the ongoing operations and maintenance costs and we pull that into an economic model and we assess that against the numbers sensitivities which is in accordance with federal requirements for funding applications and in this particular case the average benefit cost ratio for the project was 1.6 and it 's never dropped below 1 for all the sensitivities that we assessed in and then got up to I think about 2.5 or so in the best case sensitivity but in general around that 1.6 suggesting that the project is is the benefits are greater than the costs basically firstly rate of return is higher than the cash discount rate which is important from an economics perspective because that means that the project should proceed immediately if you can and though it 's current appraisal so as a quick summary again project was led by one of our us practice leads Jim neehoff he was here throughout the project as it 's a process of ourselves to do constructibility review setting as 100 views and in this case council also engaged independent consultant oricon to reduce independent reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technical efforts are there and there on the website so again there 's it 's not a small bit of work as you can probably understand there 's a significant amount of outputs and technical reports and a like that gets produced and that 's that 's of a quick snapshot the other complimentary works and these are important because we have recommended these to council as well ting clearly meander it 's still ongoing erosion at the pink really meander getting closer to the road every flood and so stabilization in the meander is important and needs to occur whether that 's through council TMR or whoever and that 's also a priority three mitigate a priority three in the 92 study as well stabilisation on the riverbank between wood street and the bend currently there 's an unprotected section of banks there where the Alevi will be adjacent that 's recommended that council do that works prior to or just after the levee project probably the key thing is if the project recedes council needs to be very clear with residual flood risk so we don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levees it 's not not a good outcome so development controls and I 'm making sure the community understands their flood risk after the levee is is paramount so our technical findings after the project was complete technically viable and would significantly reduce flood risk for the interior area the project will impact on some private lands and require assumptions or easements that 's important to note it will have some impacts of flood behavior which we 've documented in our reports economic evaluation shows that the project is positive in terms of BCR and importantly any levee or any major infrastructure requires careful construction and an operation and maintenance to ensure that it actually performs its intended function and so that 's that 's an important recommendation right that 's me [Applause] okay just before I start I just want to ensure everyone that we will allocate a full 30 minutes for question time and I 'm conscious of time at the moment soil is quicker than brief as I can some of this has already been discovered by Ben so I 'm going to go through these quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified as in the flood zone there 's the regular cleanup costs and damage costs that should be included there is a potential for reduction in insurance premiums the final alignment as it was as it has it 's been designed prevents protects key infrastructure and it 's critical now with that yep and crossing button completed that really does put a focus on Gladstone Road because once it closes and rate is protected suddenly we have the National Highways protected so that is a very significant piece of infrastructure to be considered I also mentioned on that slide of South Rockhampton treatment plan and also a number of existing schools so there is some key infrastructure that is protected by this levee right now countless current commitment I mentioned earlier we have our floodplain management strategy that 's adopted Council spends on average around three million dollars a year to effectively undertake studies and design flood mitigation works these studies and the works are funded from our general revenue where we are right now councils draft 2017-18 budget as Ben has allocated ten million dollars over three years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next steps this was mentioned briefly by Ben the project has been fully designed in an engineering sense there are some other steps to go forward planning approval is required and that involves effectively council lodging an application and getting environmental approval and planning approval to proceed and that is another step in the process where an actual fact this project will be exhibited for public comment there 's property acquisitions there is an early works package there was lots of talk about utilities stormwater and down in the need for backflow so there is an opportunity to start work on that early works which is effectively works we control ourselves and then the final step is the construction of a levee and that would be done as a major contract and through a tender process thank you very much [Applause]","(-23.3786203,

Australia",1292,hello my name is Tracy Cooper Lavery and I 'm the director of rockhampton art gallery well I 'm I 've been here at the gallery for just on seven months and came to the gallery from bendigo and Victoria my most memorable experience with that would be when I was young I was probably when I was in primary school and I was studying art and it was one of my favorite things at school it 's always been one of my favorite things and I remember my teacher at the time calling my mum at a parent-teacher evening and and saying to my mother that she had to stop encouraging me to be interested in art and to be an artist because I was never going to be any good and that I should I should probably focus my attention on business studies so I guess for me that 's probably my most memorable experience because I didn 't pay any attention to what she said and I kept going with my love of art the strengths of the Rockhampton art gallery collection are definitely the works from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing collection of artists such as Sydney Nolan Fred Williams John Brack Charles Blackman and it for a regional gallery it 's a really impressive collection and I think that 's something for me that I 'm really keen to promote while i 'm here at the gallery is to kind of get that collection out to the public so that the people can really enjoy it my favorite part of the collection would be those those really well-known artists from from the collection so that sort of mid 20th century period particularly the the artists that were involved as part of the angry penguins the group that formed so in the 40s in Melbourne all part of the Heidi group as well they 're also that same group I think they are really strong in the collection the work I 've chosen today is alice in wonderland by charles Blackman from the mid-1950s I guess I 've always been a bit of a fan of Charles Blackman I really like his work and in particular the Alice series i think are really beautiful and quite profound works I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a really good example of that series by by Blackmon I was really drawn to this artwork by black men particularly the eyes I think what kind of caught my attention first the eyes are really large in Alice 's face and when you know a little bit about the history of this series by Blackmon it kind of makes sense because at the time when he produced these works his wife Barbara Blackman was actually starting to lose her sight quite dramatically and that obviously affected him quite a lot and so when you look at a lot of the Alice works Alice has very large eyes and quite gray eyes and Blackman actually after the Alice series was completed towards the late 50s he actually did a portrait of his wife Barbara after she 'd lost her sight and the eyes are really quite different to how the Alice pictures look I think the other interesting thing about this work and and I guess the the blackman series and the way that child 's black man paints is it 's quite an expressionistic way of painting you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a very kind of graphic it 's a very graphic painting for me and I think the thing that is interesting as well is that when you when you look at the Alice in Wonderland story even though it 's a children 's story it really has quite a dark strange kind of even gothic undertone i guess and and I kind of sense that from this picture as well because even though you 've got Alice standing there with her pretty blue dress and her flowers I guess the way the background is painted in those kind of you should browns and grays it kind of gives a dark sinister feel to the painting the composition in the work i think is is really striking again when you sort of look at alice 's face you 've got these very kind of angular shapes and the background is very angular as well you have these lines kind of heading up towards her forward that kind of draw your eye up to the face and and also I kind of guess looking at the image again now when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual shape of the face is a really heart-shaped face which i think is probably a symbolic feature that Blackman 's put into the image I think with this work Blackman and and also I guess with the with the Alice in Wonderland series it a lot of Blackman 's work kind of I guess looks at the duality of life so the pictures really telling two stories it 's telling us the story about Alice in Wonderland which you know would be familiar to most people but it 's also telling us the story of his wife Barbara and her her sight and the way that her sight started to fail and and just the difficulties that that would have had associated with it Charles Blackmon is probably I guess arguably one of Australia 's most important living artists he as I said he he was involved with the Heidi group and was was part of the angry penguins many years ago now when I used to work at the Gold Coast City Art Gallery we did a big exhibition of Charles Blackman 's Alice pictures and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mad Hatter 's Tea Party and it was just a fantastic opportunity that I got to actually meet Charles Blackman and speak with him about the works and he spent the evening in this giant throne that we had brought in to thee into the gallery and he sat at the end of a very long table decided Mad Hatter 's Tea Party and wore a crown and it was again it was quite surreal to have Charles Blackman in the room surrounded with all these pictures and kind of supposed lording over the group of people there since I 've been working at the gallery I 've had I 've had some opportunity to start to really investigate the collection but it 's been great to actually do this artwork of the month because it 's meant that it 's given me that little bit more focus and to really think about the the pieces that are in the collection I have to admit it was really hard to pick a work because we have so many great pictures in the collection I 'm looking forward to working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic mid 20th century pictures that we have in the collection having this fantastic collection in rockhampton is a fantastic opportunity for people to really experience some of the greatest artists and and Reyes works created by Australian artists and I think that you know it 's really important I mean one of the things I really want to do while I 'm here is is encourage as many people as possible to come and see the collection and see the exhibitions that we put together from this amazing group of works,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

I 'm approve any further you 'll get this word for word trainees already been prepared as well for you so we 're using the base case from the QTC report this was also modeled for the d amalgamation proponents the Livingston community will receive a 4.3 percent rate rise in general rates with this budget with 5.3 temperature teens there are no new long-term borrowings on behalf of Livingston we have drafted a full capital works list 7 23 24 million dollars of which heart will be delivered prior to the first of January the remaining we delivered were altered by the incoming living in

down a mini budget to cover the first six months of its operation and must address these denomination costs in either its first or second to budget we have taken every decision as happy as possible and in good faith recognizing Livingston 's desire to be separate and respecting that so the budget that I 'm bringing down today or that I am presenting to the community today is a budget in two parts there 's 12 months of rockhampton Regional Council and six months of living system when council passes its budge resolution it will actually be as one budget but a big long site in two parts there are so the long-term financial plan always had the rates rise this year is one percent above the council cost index and that is what we use we will also be carved in appropriate resolutions that

is a an outstanding incredibly important aspect of the budget and if I had a wish about what the headlines would be tomorrow would not be eight percent rate rise it would be while County Regional

QTC review later this year and hope and believe that we will return to our model a grating my mother point out that this has not and will not come without some pain we will however move forward and there are a range of things some of which I 've already talked about in the public domain that are put us on this great trajectory the rate rise for the average owner-occupier is eight percent for our

backwards remembering that by 2017 QTC were saying we 've run out of cash if we had raised our rates they were projecting sixteen percent we have made cuts and our eyes as a present and our cash is is

a Tennyson right tries this is higher than was planned prior to DML information that causes the losses in the sixteen percent that QTC had suggested we do to balance the budget pages will receive an extra leeway to fifty dollars per year or twenty-five dollars per half year this should offset the negative impact of the higher than anticipated rate rise incorporated seniors groups in each

minister 's deliberate strategy as he sell saurik the mayor is the one in his held responsible come election councillors now have the option and full authority to change the bug anyway they wish I 've already told them that I accept and encourage them to make the budget at home if they are not happy with this one they have seen how the budget came together through multiple workshops council staff are now at their disposal to make any changes as most of the things taking effect for the continuing rockhampton region don 't take effect until the first of January may I request that the instant

which takes in number of responsibilities including boating facilities I 'd like to take a few minutes of your time to discuss the both boat ramp feasibility study or undertaking and the community engagement that we 're about to embark on as you may or may not be aware the region only has a few all tied rents in this area which are being used beyond their capacity and particularly through peak periods it 's inadequate but given the amount of both users and the amount of recreational fishermen in this area certainly within our region and the forecast growth and demand we are well behind our quota of eligible voters to cater for the needs when you take into account the number of ramps in our northern cities and the number of recreational fishermen compared with ours we are disproportionately behind seriously behind so it 's done interest at the seams and our people are putting the pressure on us so to speak to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very much project that I 'm hopefully Victor by the time we 've can our communications with the public we will be able to satisfy their needs given the information that we 're blend from our vote users are many vote users we put this information to the state government and this is resulted in a Memorandum of Understanding between the Rockhampton Regional Council and the Department of Transport and Main Roads and the MOU is to conduct a joint study into the identification of potential sites for an all tied bow dream this is focused on the southern end of the Capricorn Coast essentially from Roseland beta couple scenes this has been identified as the main focus the main need for our bodies so we 've started at that point in this joint study the castle essentially needs to provide the Department of Transport and Main Roads up to ten potential areas of interest in the order of preference the Department will then undertake further studies into suitability for a more technical perspective undertaking tests such as bathymetric studies etc there will be of course there is other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before about red would be built so at this point we 're at the start of the process but the wheels are moving at last it is essential from councils perspective that the community is involved from the very beginning while we have an in community that is involved they have ownership and it saves us a lot of headaches down the track if we bring them into the discussion too early in the Peace Council will be undertaking an extensive community engagement exercise seeking local knowledge and experience to help inform us where the most optimal place for an all tight boat ramp should be we all say we need to take into account any concerns residents or stakeholders may have with these potential sites our community engagement exercise will involve a one-on-one interviews with representatives outlined in the infrastructure committee minutes which is recreational boating facilities study of the fourth of July 2012 beginning mid-september 2012 a one-on-one discussion with local stakeholder groups to outline process and how to be involved through the survey and submissions beginning mid-september 2012 the creation of south Capricorn Coast boqueria advisory committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information of potential sites and provision of a preference order of these sites from their analysis and discussions expect these will be quite intense beginning late-september 2012 a preference survey of potential sites sent to all local residents and groups of the identified area essentially residents including South of Rosslyn babe through to pebble sentence beginning mid October 2012 detailed submissions can be submitted to council beginning mid-october 2012 an open online survey for all community members any resident without internet access across the Rockhampton region can request a survey be provided to them mid october two thousand just contact customer service number 1 300 double to double five double seven I need to mention that council acknowledges the efforts of various boating and fishing groups that have requested these facilities for some time and we look forward to them being involved in this process their input is most crucial to obtaining a very beneficial outcome we are aiming to have detailed information of all potential sites a preference order of sites from the Advisory Committee residents and all other information collated in a report that will go to counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infrastructure committee here at council I look forward to your participation in this

's infrastructure committee recently the south capricorn coast advisory committee meant to discuss potential sites along the coast based on their preliminary advice we are understand undertaking a survey on several potential sites these sites are firstly the rosalind bay boat harbour the proposed concept is to provide additional boat ramps at the current site the pros for this site there is existing infrastructure already established and it is accessible via a main arterial road that being the scenic highway and breakwaters are already in place to protect from adverse weather and wind the cons additional parking spaces would need to be found as available land is limited potential levels of congestion as it is currently congested on public and school holiday periods there 's only one road in and out of the facility and the current facility backs onto a national park our next location is north kemp beach the proposed concept for north kemp is creation of a new all-tied boat ramp facility the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-time boat ramp facility at north camp beach to the east of the already existing rosslyn bay boat harbour the pros for this site it is accessible via remain arterial road which again is the scenic highway close to rosland bay boat harbour with its existing infrastructure deep water can be accept accessed and protected from northerly winds the cons additional parking spaces would need to be found available land is limited potential levels of congestion with roslyn bay boat harbor may be incurred but and there is only one road in and out of this facility the current facility backs onto a national park and this would be costly to implement our next location is south kemp beach the proposed concept is the creation of a new all-time boat ramp facility the description proposed concept is the creation of a new all-time boat facility at south kemp beach close to the existing amenities located here the pros south kemp accessible by our main arterial road which is the scenic highway council is a custodian of a recreational reserve at this location with protection from south easterlies and access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs onto a national path all facilities would need to be built and would therefore be costly to implement there is the potential for environmental issues and extensive marine studies would need to be completed our next location is rita mata the proposed concept is the creation of a new all-time boat ramp facility description proposed concept is the creation of an all-time boat ramp facility that would have a breakwater and head to the north from the rita mata headland the pros for this site is protection from the southeasterly winds potential for long-term future development and closer to the major townships of new park and zlz the cons land tenure issues as this land is not owned by any level of government various rocky outcrops are in this area and all facilities would need to be built and would therefore be costly to implement and potential environmental issues would exist our next location is fisherman 's beach bbu park south headland the proposed concept is a creation of a new all-time boat ramp facility this is a conscious conceptual layout only the description proposed concept is the reclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself would need to be north of the headland with the parking to the east the pros professional beach is protection from south easterly and northerly winds road infrastructure is in place located in a growing township avenue park and currently a beach access ramp is located at fisherman 's beach and could add to the township 's local economy the cons for this site potential traffic issues with the construction and operations of the boat ramp they may impede on the township 's residence unknown total cost and more extensive marine studies would need to be undertaken our next location is ladies beach and the proposed concept is the creation of a new all-time boat ramp facility the description the proposed concept is the creation of a marina style boat ramp utilizing either hill street or granville street as access the pros for ladies beach located in the growing township of emu park close to zilsey and could add to the township 's local economy the cons it 's costly higher impact and open location to both south easterly and north easterly winds the potential traffic issues with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the township 's residence there are unknown total costs and more extensive marine studies would need to be undertaken our final location is kurubum creek the proposed concept is additional boat ramps implemented at the current site the description the proposed concept is the further addition of extra boat ramps to be placed at the existing site with additional pontoons and channel markers to allow for easier access to and from plural creek and the ocean the pros for coromand creek existing infrastructure is already established generally protected from strong winds it is in a growing area and may be good for launching point for smaller boats that is under six metres where larger boats could use rosalind bay boat harper the cons for permanent crew are larger vessels that 's six metres and over may not be able to obtain ocean access in low tides unless some dredging work is completed as chair of your infrastructure committee here at council i look forward to your participation because it is important that we hear your voice your opinions are very important to us thank you,"(-23.3786203,

art bits of paint and everything all around so that was always a fun place to explore but my own personal memories obviously with a camera and it was her camera that I first got to play with and there 's an SLR and was a lot of fun just exploring that and i think is where my passion for photography has come from I 'll take photos every day i I do do some stuff for myself probably not as often as I 'd like to I do have some of my artwork though hanging up on the wall at home the collection is amazing it 's such a variety of topics of styles there 's something for everybody I guess it 's a lot of history a lot of local work which is amazing to see yeah it 's just fascinating place to happen tell them chance to have a browse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were looking at and thinking wow that 's amazing knowing that it was a local artist was really good to know you don 't always appreciate that we have such a talent in this area whether it 's parenteral talent or their its talent from McGorry but we do have a great amount of talent this region and it 's good to encourage that oftentimes when you think of an artwork it 's not always as big as some of the ones and the one I pick today 's is on the larger side and it 's great to have something that 's very big but you don 't always have the chance to hang something like that in your own house I chose entanglement inversion by a net bezoar this is actually the second time I 'd say in this piece and it struck me the first time as well it 's it 's an immense painting but it 's just the feeling that it gives you it 's the emotion behind it the color the style just everything it 's something that you can look at and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much in it it 's something that you don 't have to get close to look at you stand back and just absorb it all it 's just trying to think of the word it 's it 's intoxicating as a soft pastel tones mixed with some of them the brighter colors just the overall emotion that comes out of the color scheme grab me first and obviously then the larger pictures that form part of their over over the overall painting it features women and it features women in in a soft light but also in a strong light it 's a positive painting for me as far as women goes the smaller sub features make it an earthy sort of emotion with he put swans if you look closely there 's other animals it 's just a really organic sort of image really earthy but really motherly as well it makes me feel proud to be a woman for starters but it just it has a real for me the color scheme has a real peaceful very to it you 've got three rather large parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same they 're different women 's faces or parts of their body and they can take your imagination each individual on its own but then when you put it back into the whole context it just there 's just so much to look at I like the colors the soft pinks the past early sort of tones that bring you into richer colors so the color scheme in particular really appeal for me it 's vibrant but being in a soft way that 's not too overpowering it 's once again I think it 's an organic sort of thing you 've got areas that are growing into other areas the more you look at it the more you see lots of layering lots of texture I think it ties in with the idea behind what she 's painting is it is multi-layered the texture of the painting is not always smooth there 's rough areas as well as smooth areas some of the facial features are very soft yet you go down to where the organic matter is and it 's some of it 's quite rough guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch some of the alarms are relating to you 've got three different phases in there you 've got you got swans you 've got that could be an egg it could be just shapes there 's lots of things in there that make you wonder what is she trying to say but it 's what it brings back to your own self so it makes you think what does it mean to me and to me it means it can be the two swans boat swans are paired for life it could be something about eternity could be new growth new life there 's so many different things that it can make you feel the face is in in the picture are quite peaceful you 've got to with their eyes shut and the two with their eyes shot do give you a sense of peace that they 're Pleasant looks on their faces there 's nothing in there at all that makes you think of anything dramatic it 's soft it 's peaceful it 's womanly you can tell she 's a woman just the way that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell she 's a woman purely because of the way she 's treated the subject it 's some done with love to me it looks like the artist is trying to say that women being one with nature that could be one element there 's lots of other elements even with the name it once again that it can also mean many different things it can be entanglement you 've got the different nature elements can be entanglement within yourself finding your own true yourself here in an HR can make it once again it can mean a lot of things as well so it 's what you take away from it and that 's I think for me it 's the best point of art what it brings to you talk to me the artwork says that the artist is certainly interested in Quantico you 'll hurt yourself self her natural self it could also be about finding her natural partner her natural life for natural lifestyle finding out where she comes from where she 's going to there 's a lot of elements in there but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entangled in where is she where is she coming from for me it 's a very personal thing it 's what it makes you feel to me it doesn 't matter who you who did it or it came from it 's what it 's about and what it actually means to you and looking through some of those pieces today has just brought back memories of my own childhood there were some pieces there that reminded me of the troubles my family went on some of them reminded me of history of the way Australia used to be even overseas it 's it takes you on a journey and that 's the best part it 's a personal journey you can have three people go through look at the exact same things and they 've all been on a different journey so for me that 's what art is the best and I 'm glad I had that chance to do that today it 's good to see that a lot of local artists who had a chance to have their works displayed whether their past artists or current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of artists Australian and overseas artists here um for anyone that 's never been here you 're really missing out there 's such a wide variety of things to look at you,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

morning we 've got some great speakers who travel wide and far and i 'm really looking forward as well i 'm sure all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for home agribusiness as well so before we get started i would like to do an acknowledgement of country i would like today to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet today the people of the narrow the gear and the jewelry nations and recognize their continuing connections to land water and culture pay our respects to their elders past and present and emerging a little bit of housekeeping for you um if you haven 't filled out the registration sheet at the front you could please ensure you do that before you leave today i 'd like to acknowledge those online online attendees who are joining us today for any reason you 're unable to stay on for the whole event this will be recorded and available online on our website and um possibly also on the movies on the regional council website as well our event running time is from 10 a.m to 12 pm however the guest speakers will be staying for at least half an hour for some networking post events so if you 'd like to ask any extra questions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till then amenities now amenities are very simple to find you can go down either set of stairs they 're located downstairs uh you 'll see them on the back of the building our emergency exit is the way you arrived and please if you have your mobile phone if you can please turn it to silent as a courtesy to our speakers this morning so first up we have uh we have an agreement lady who is a libya broadcast many of you have already met her she is the coordinator of the whitsunday climate change innovation hub she facilitates projects that provide information resources and funding to improve the whitsunda regional council 's ability to mitigate prepare for and adapt to predictive climate change she has worked closely with landholders community and industry to achieve positive outcomes to improve the resilience of our region to future natural disasters and other predicted climate extremes so this morning olivia will be framing the event by providing an overview of climate change and a bit of a regional snapshot of our region so please welcome olivia thanks lee and welcome everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm just going to be giving a little bit of an introduction and setting the scene and i wouldn 't be the climate health coordinator without giving you a little bit of an update on climate change to start so i 'll just all right so on the right hand side of the slide you can see what is the general predictions for our region under climate change and i have also put up there um the february carbon dioxide levels globally so this comes from a laboratory in hawaii where they measure the global levels of carbon dioxide carbon dioxide levels are currently at about 419 parts per million increasing from around 280 pre-industrial revolutions so before we got really smart and started driving lots of cars and manufacturing and really boosting industrial product production our levels of carbon dioxide were 280 they used to increase naturally by 0.6 parts per million per year and now we 're at about two and a half parts per million per year so you can see that humans have greatly increased the amount of carbon dioxide that is increasing in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of emission scenario so all of the modelling that has been getting done today tracks a high emission scenario and we are well above that so we 've been tracking climate change for over 30 years now we 've been making predictions about climate change which have all more than come true so when we talk about climate change and we do make those those modeling predictions we can take them as being fairly accurate from the history that we 've seen over the past 30 years with the predictions so at the moment we are all looking at climate change and starting to set some targets and starting to really mobilize our action um we are all made all set targets and you would have heard the paris agreement talk about trying to limit warming to below two degrees or that let 's let 's try and limit warming to 1.5 degrees well we 're already at 1.1 degrees forming globally so a lot of people think that that 's what we 've got to go from now but that is actually a goal which we 're already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global temperature was 1.19 degrees above the industrial revolution goal so we are already tracking towards that 1.5 degrees warming scenario [Music] so i suppose i can add then one point i missed on this one for frozen on it is that um with the current emission scenario as it is now we will be tracking a 2.8 degrees warming by 2050 and close to 5 degrees by 2100 so if we keep going the way we 're going we 're going to well overshoot our 1.5 degree target and i have put here on the right a little diagram about what that means and for us here in this region obviously there 's massive impacts for all of our industries and economies natural disaster impacts and agricultural impacts but the biggest one is probably going to be the reef so the reef we call the canary for climate change the biggest threat to the reef is climate change you might have heard we 're going through a large marine heatwave event at the moment and the marine park authority are out there mapping at the moment what the coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quite a severe bleaching event so what that means is the water has heated up to a certain temperature in which the corals are all under stress and they 've all expelled their symbiotic algae if that algae does not return within 40 days and that that would happen normally under a scenario where a storm event comes through and cools down water if that does not happen within 40 days then those corals will die so at the moment they 're under high stress and we 're hoping that we 'll get that cool cooling come so they don 't all actually die from the bleaching event so we 'll wait and see about that but you can see here that if we hit the 1.5 degree warming 90 of our corals are at risk so we might see a few species survive some of the cooler water species deeper water species some of them might survive but we 're going to lose majority majority of our biodiversity on the reef and the reef will looks will look completely different as it is now but if we head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even squeezing out those corals that have that more are more adapted to rock higher temperatures next all right renewable energy so the purpose of today is to really talk about renewable energy and look at how we can tap into that renewable energy in our region and really um start to change what the um what what the emissions look like in our region that are coming from electricity so i put up here some of the um ways that we can produce renewable electricity so we 've got hydroelectric power coming from dams and river water etc wave and tidal energy coming from our oceans solar energy coming from sunlight biomass geothermal and wind energies i think that 's quite self-explanatory next renewals are increasing so these stats are from december 2020 so you can see there um how the power in our in australia is broken up so you can see that solar power wind power is increasing or is at seven percent of the um network and hydropower sitting at five percent next all right so i have pulled out some statistics here from 2019 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two percent the only reason i 'm focusing on that year and not a more recent year is because the statistics are delaying coming out so this is the latest statistics so black coal production fell by two percent brown coals fell by four percent um 54 of the network was made from um coal power that year and we 've started to see 24 made by renewables so we did have a brief times last year where over 50 of the group was fueled by renewable power so over the whole year we 're sitting at about 24 renewable but at times it was a lot more than that so we are seeing some shifts happening um we have seen the australian capital territory refueled by 100 renewable power last year so they were the first state territory to reach that goal and queensland goal is to hit that by 2030. sorry 50 by 2030 this queensland 's goal i 've just put um one last slide up here to show the diversity and the scale of some of the investment at the moment into renewable technologies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production from these projects and enable it to be used and tapped into it at different times depending on demand so you can see that around the country there 's quite a lot of different projects and a lot of investments so there were 17 billion dollars of investment over the years from 2017 to 2021 in producing renewable energy projects around the country this is our with sunday emissions snapshot so this is why we 're all here to try and look at our emissions and the whitsundays emissions and how we can affect those so in our region you can see that our municipal emissions for the year up to june 2020 again there is a lag in the collection of the data for that financial year was 1.1 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases and 54 of that came from electricity so it is a massive part of our emissions footprint for the region and we can all obviously do our bits to try and start to change that curve and try and bring that section of our emissions down so that 's my intro does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right i 'll pass it on oh yes if you wanted to connect with the climate hub after this we have a facebook page we have a website and we also have a newsletter so you can find the link to sign up to the visit on our website thank you thanks olivia okay an introduction to our next speaker daniel sanders has been an irv on energy retail for 17 years starting in the contact center in 2004 daniel has held positions in training and development network pricing customer management community service obligation and retail tariff strategy and is currently the manager of business development he is responsible for the identification negotiation and management of urban energy retails power purchase agreements with predominantly renewable energy generators as well as a team of business development staff located in cairns townsville and brisbane today daniel will be covering urban irvine 's clean energy program for residential and business customers [Music] [Music] i want to do with the presentation is i might start at a higher level first and give it a bit of a brief introduction to energy queensland so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit more about what energy queensland is doing more broadly in the renewable energy space then i 'll come down and talk a bit more about what ergonomic retail is doing and then the products we have available to our customers both residential and commercial and what you guys can do to contribute as part of the renewable energy push for those interested that 's a photo of a foundry located in mirabara um cr mining i think they 're called now so one of our large customers based in miramar so when you think about renewable energy and where it ends up it does end up in places like that heavy manufacturing as well so it 's not just about houses and other sort of small entities places like their family customers are well into this as well so so in terms of who is energy queensland we were formed in 2016 as part of a merger between the distribution entities uh retail entity and energy services business that we have it 's a absolutely 100 government-owned corporation so we are owned by the good people of queensland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wires business being ergon energy network and energex the only in southeast queensland obviously the retail business which is the owner and i work for but we also have a energy services business now called eureka they cover a whole gamut of stuff everything from construction and maintenance of solar farms and the like to metering telecoms and a whole host of other things so both eureka and ourselves are effectively sort of unregulated businesses and that we 're not managed or pricing isn 't managed by the australian regulator in terms of some of the numbers we have about seven and a half thousand employees that does change by the day as you would expect in terms of total queensland so when i talk energy queensland i 'm talking total numbers in queensland about 2.3 million connected customers to the ergon energex networks um we have a apprentice up to um apprentice sort of uptake of a couple hundred years currently sitting at 460 odd um fiona and i we 've um work for a business it has 700 000 plus customers um to give you a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 kilometers of poles and wires spread from um or for us as far as toowoomba all the way up to port douglas um and out into the western zones as well so 1.7 million power poles as you can imagine that 's quite a flight to manage from an asset perspective 29 000 kilometers of underground power cables um i know everyone would like to see more because they think that that 's going to sort of future proof from cyclones but the reality is that at some point this stuff is above ground so as much as you want to put it underground and it comes at cost um unfortunately a lot of it still sits above ground um three customer solution centres so um one in townsville one in rockhampton and one in brisbane um 33 standalone power stations and i 'll talk about those a little bit later um and about 690 000 small-scale solar energy systems connected so that 's the stuff that 's on people 's roads as i said about 690 000 solar connections supported by the network business about 4.4 gba distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not only helping to support obviously the energy investors so i 've quite identifying others but it 's really helping our business customers get access to cheap renewable energy as well so this is a quick map of some of the connections that we have at the moment um predominantly sort of bioenergy so let 's eat sugar mills um but also you 're seeing a lot more soil farm and wind come into the system as well there 's a little bit of hydro around um paradise dam so some water paradise down and also up its barren gorge as well so just to touch briefly on the isolated systems that have been maintained so obviously not every part of queensland is connected to the grid particularly the island communities as well so in last towards the end of last year on network launched a program where they 're going to look to start to transition those communities away from diesel power generation obviously it needs to be sustainable cost-effective and reliable and at the same time how can we help customers in those communities connect solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect um rooftop solar into isolated networks um because you 're sort of trying to manage a separate grid um control can be a bit of a challenge at times there is feasibility studies underway um looking at micro group capability into those communities so fiona and i are involved in discussions around uh helping out if you under thursday island baby garaba and mapoon at the moment more ones that are certainly a focus um and a lot of that work is being funded through the australian government 's regional and remote communities reliability fund so it 's pretty exciting times we 've been lucky to sort of see a number of those proposals look like and they are as you can hope on a lot of solar a lot of battery storage there 's talk of a bit of waste of gas as well and also fibre so the gas from sugars as well so in terms of where we see the future going so this is a slide that i borrowed from an egm um presentation that goes towards in the last year so as i said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the network at the moment um 4.2 gigahertz of solar um so when you aggregate up all the solar in queensland it 's actually far larger than any baseline power station that is currently around so it 's larger than toronto larger than cs so it is effectively the largest generator in queensland as i said about seven hundred thousand rooftop connections um and we hit 1.7 watts of minimum demand in september 2020 so i won 't spend too much time on time talking about minimum demand um but certainly the conversation has changed in the last few years it 's historically always been about maximum demand in the state and having to build a network that 's able to do or deal with you know a maximum demand if you think about february um this year for example i think only a few weeks ago there was a maximum demand report set in the state so it 's actually sort of swinging now the conversations coming back towards how do we manage minimum demand um because there are forecasts that suggest as early as 2024 the energex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission network so how do you start managing that sort of reverse flow of energy of that that size um so where do we see it going um about 2.6 million connected customers um obviously we have a view that a lot more people are going to be moving to queensland why wouldn 't you we again anticipate that maximum demand is going to continue to grow but at the same time we 'll continue to have a issue with minimum demand in fact as i said it could get to a point where it 's actually negative demand in some periods of the day and sometimes every year so um and we obviously see continued growth in solar so getting upwards around to the 19 watts of connected solar and that number of root top solar connections um forecasting double cards in 2013. so who are we in terms of fiona and i and ergo retail so again part of the energy queensland group created in 2016 but obviously the irvine retail brand has been around a lot longer than that 17 years at least our customer solution center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do call us you are speaking to someone in queensland who is likely to know where early beach is and some of the challenges that you guys have but we do have around 300 employees within retail based in cairns townsville maravara and brisbane as well we do sell electricity at notified prices so our price is set by the queensland competition authority um so i 'm happy to take questions about price um but know that it is set independently of us by an independent regulatory body one of the benefits obviously of the qca setting a price is that it is set the same for everybody in queensland so regardless of the cost of actual transport effectively the price is the same regardless of whether you 're in towing by early beach mission beach that is supported obviously by the queensland government 's community service obligation which is about 460 million a year i might just take a step back though actually and probably just come back to energy queensland and so you mentioned some of the councils with carbon footprint earlier um to give you a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's about 1.7 million tons of co2 equipment that was in 20 19 20 so good somebody yourself sort of those are the latest numbers i can get my hands on um it 's predominantly driven by losses in the distribution network um so it 's sort of scope two emissions if you 're familiar with how some of the co2 emissions are measured it 's predominantly stuck to losses in the network so that 's a very challenging thing to try and get under control obviously just given the sheet distance of our network however we do have a carbon low carbon future statement that is available on energy queensland 's website um what that speaks to or certainly what our target is is a 17 reduction in our co2 footprint by 2030. the main focus of that is going to be as i said around generation particularly in the remote communities but also what we can do with a transport fleet um so what vehicles can we move to the pipeline we drove down the higher today but what vehicles can we move to electric as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing electric ew ewps as well so but also what can we do within our own buildings so depots for example obviously our depots all over the state um with lease buildings as well so airbuilding in townsville 's lease so how do we work with the owner um to sort of get the carbon footprint of that building under control um air office is the only new city of brisbane i think there 's a six star energy deficiency rating that was part of their um terms of the least the owner of that building is that it reached a certain environmental target as well i think a little bit more closer to home perhaps something that would be a little bit more obvious to people too is that we have a target to replace about 200 000 mercury vapor street lights um and that 's a target we 're looking out to i think 2025 yeah so um five year after year sorry so a five year program of replacement of over 200 000 mercury vapor with more efficient leds we 've got about 24 000 street lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us it 's about forty thousand um forty thousand um uh forty thousand tons uh reduction in co2 um but obviously it 's a win for councils and transport and main roads as well because led lights are a lot cheaper to run so um you know you might be having a word to you guys about um the led replacement program and sort of working with the sunday council on that as well so um in terms of some other stuff that urban retail participates in obviously we 've been a partner of the royal flying doctors service for about um 20 odd years now um our customers and their staff have managed to raise about 16 million over that time um it 's gone to purchasing new aircraft and other equipment for them we 've partnered with a whole bunch of organizations over the years as well so fiona and i have been to plenty of events around the state and we do have a community program as well as an employee volunteer program as well so fiona and i can take um a day or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year where we can go volunteer at a time into an organisation that 's helping we also have a partnership with powerlink and icann where we 've worked with those guys to support seven north queenslanders to become qualified financial advisors mainly targeted at helping out and more vulnerable customers um and bringing those services into communities where they perhaps wouldn 't otherwise exist so as we 've mentioned we could put down um so in terms of how we support renewable energy in queensland we 're actually one of the largest purchases of renewable energy in queensland that is predominantly done through the power purchase agreements that we have we have those power purchase agreements really have supported a couple of large projects in the last couple years mainly the mount emerald wind farm up on the atlantic lands and the willow bar solar farm just north of sorry north northeast of emerald as well obviously the main one for us is from biomass so we do have agreements with all the shortages or most of the sugar mills um in regional queensland um and obviously it 's supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably know you know sort of happening in the sugar industry more than i do but um it 's been certainly interesting over the years to watch what was you know sort of a side business of electricity generation become more of the force for those businesses as well and obviously that in turn has helped secure cheap removable energy for our customers as well so as i said we 've got about a dozen counterparties under contract at the moment um it 's about one thousand people one hours in generation which is the equivalent of about 220 000 homes um worth of energy per year i 'm just pictured there 's uh mountain available wig farm and it 's heavy sugar that we have under contract at the moment um at a sort of more local level or i should say a residential level we have about 145 000 customers that are currently receiving the solar feed intact um i think to be clear that 's the um eight center field hour solar beating that ergonomic retail pays not the 44 cent that 's paid by the network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um in terms of what we 've paid out in the last year was about 45 million dollars i think the network payments were about three times that yes um [Music] um the exports enough to power about 150 000 homes a year um i appreciate it solar um so you know when you think about you know supplying your home do you think in 24 7 but i 'll talk about what we 're sort of doing in the battery space a little bit more so um so before i get on to that um i just just in relation to batteries um you may have seen towards the end of last year um and um energy queensland launched its local battery network plane to help address the minimum demand issue i spoke about earlier but also to try and start to realize some of the benefits of the amount of local generation that is happening so and obviously in support of the government 's 50 percent renewable target so we 're looking at installing about 40 megawatt hours of network connected batteries throughout the state um the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and been connected now those being in towns would you appear in thunderbird carbon bay and toolbar obviously the batteries or the antenna batteries is to take that generation that 's been produced locally store it locally and then try and use it locally particularly during those peak demand periods in the evening i think one of the challenges for us and certainly something to take up a lot of my time and product wise time is given that we are constrained by notified prices um how can we try and sort of break the shackles of that a little bit and and try and share that benefit of locally producing stored energy um while still you know sort of being tied to a set price so in terms of how um uh how you can support clean energy we do have a clean energy program it 's one of the simplest ways that you as a household business can help reduce your carbon footprint and help support the renewable energy industry in queensland when you subscribe to clean energy you do pay a little bit more and it depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from renewable energy sources that are certified by green power so that 's a government program that basically audits us every year to ensure that the lgc 's that we 're purchasing support the program do come from credited sources so we have a couple of counterparties where we have asked them to go through that process and become accredited um so you do know that they are you know legitimate lgc 's or particular schools and i 'll speak a little bit about business but really the green power label as i said makes it easy to recognize that these are from certified sources it 's actually something that you can use yourselves as part of your business later ahead etc if you purchase a certain amount you can start to use the green power logo to show your customers that you 're contributing to this program as well so for residential customers it 's ten dollars a quarter it gets pro writer down to a daily rate because we are mindful that there are more and more customers that are receiving monthly bills now not quarterly um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter sort of works out about three dollars you know three dollars a month um as i said prorated um so it comes in at about um about ten dollars for a 31 day bill about three dollars for the efforts um so that 's if you want to subscribe to say 10 um so sorry i should say at 10 it 's equivalent of about 10 of the average household usage um obviously if you want to contribute more it increases the percentage that you 're offsetting in-house from a business perspective it 's done a little bit differently it 's actually percentage based as opposed to dollars based so you can go as any lowers anywhere from two and a half percent to a hundred percent of your energy um being accredited through lgc 's we do have we had a customer at the end of last year um sign up time of central 's we 've got customers that sit anywhere in between that whole gathering as well so what we 're finding is for a lot of customers it 's a quick and easy way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work print without having to invest in infrastructure themselves um so whatever reason they may not be able to install solar on their business for example but if they 're leasing but it is one way that they can still show that their customers that they are taking steps towards debt zero at the moment it 's about 6.2 cents a kilowatt hour extra on your bill that price does get reviewed periodically so i think we looked at it a year or two ago i think it 's due for a new review again very shortly um because you are obviously mindful of the markets moves as well um as i said if you subscribe to 10 or more clean energy your business may be entitled to use the green power logo on company sites and marketing materials um we can walk you through what 's required to do that if you want to sign up so as i said depending on sort of how higher up you want to get from a residential perspective if you look at something around 100 a month that covers the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a little bit different but that 's based on about six and a half thousand kilowatt hours a year but you can sort of see the costs basically different percentages there we also calculated that we bring house gas emissions and reductions in the bike as well and looks a little bit different but again why we can work with businesses to help understand what those percentages look like the goals [Music] so yeah that 's a bit of an overview of energy queensland all the way down to what you guys can do at a customer level so um just a quick one um in regards to getting involved into renewable residential if you guys might have a 1-800 number or something yeah so you can reach us like um 13-10-46 um to her well yeah or i 'll give you some details afterwards um yeah it 's as simple as ringing a contact center um but just get your account details and present it on straight away so very simple yeah um one of the things as we 're trying to encourage more of the community to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own right for me is that with year on year on year on year we 're seeing the customers feeding tariffs going down yep and a kilowatt per hour rate rising so that gap 's getting larger so we should try and keep that gap closer to parity to encourage more people you know i understand you 've got to pay for the power lines and the services but there 's also connection fees and yeah i mean so i think to get more of the community involved they need to see the win some keen to understand yeah so um i 'm not sure if you guys are aware the queensland competition authority released their drafts prices for next year a couple weeks ago and it 's a bit of a double-edged sword because they 're actually forecasting increased costs onto your build so i think that it was about four percent increase for residential customers um on the flip side of that um the way that they calculate the feed in tariffs so again we 're required by law to not only charge you a notified price but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the feed in tariff price that qca does and the way in which they do that is they take a lot of components out of your tariff election for example and actually build up a feeding tariff price so um the double edged sword is if you see the energy rates for tariff 11 go up your feeding tariff is actually going to go up as well so keep an eye out for that i think end of may the due release final prices and i absolutely anticipate the feed and tariffs that 's a consequence yeah it hasn 't been coming down the last couple years but that again is a consequence of the notification the interesting thing is you just aren 't getting a notification that watch this excuses have feedings yeah do you know what i mean it 's like um yeah and and i want you know you want to we want to encourage our community to embrace it and you know fair enough subsidies upfront but i think part of the equation is the ongoing at least perception of that that is good value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've seen in the last two years and and you know the assumption is it 's very much covered driven because people weren 't going on holidays and sort of sort of investing the money elsewhere um there 's been an explosion of solar pv being installed in queensland in the last two years like far beyond anything even the australian energy market operator was forecasting so those poor guys have had you know step change forecasts that they just had to throw away them and start again so it 's been enormous and people are making those decisions for their own reasons certainly freedom tariff is one of them um you know i think the 40 small cent feed in tariff if you think back to when that closed um the stampede of applications that we 've got towards the end of that program isn 't it we 've seen similar numbers in the last two years so yeah but um yeah so as i said it 's a bit of a double-edged sword of you know when qca puts up the price of tariff 11 for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes up i 'm just wondering with the costs for renewable power and business and homes if i 'm just to use round figures making you know a certain amount of solar per day and maybe i 'm using 50 and i 'm feeding the other 50 back into the grid but then say i use 70 so i 've got you know whatever got over 100 but you know i mean i 'm using a little bit more than what i 'm feeding in am i um am i paying the renewable energy green energy rate on you know seventy percent or like on what i use or what i use think based on total consumption so what you use from the grid so if i 'm already feeding a certain amount say five kilowatt hours back into the grid but i 'm using seven do i pay the extra tariff on the two or on the seven so using also providing five kilowatt hours that 's going to someone else or the other club yeah yeah by overshooting my ambitious reduction yeah and i think that 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other guys sort of speak to that but um you know it 's yes we are seeing an increase in export yes it 's causing us issues from a network perspective around minimum demand unfortunately steps have to be taken to deal with that and that can come at a cost as well uh but yeah you 're right i think we 're working towards some products around smart solar in terms of giving people information around where they are importing and exporting and sort of saying look why don 't you move your pool pump to mid all the day when you move um you know if you can watching and that sort of stuff yeah so we 'd absolutely love to see people use it a bit more smiley and that 's not in the interest of avoiding pain or feeling tariff that 's just the recognition of there is a broader impact happening here that 's going to get paid for by everyone basically you have this all the solar you 've got extra power in the middle of the day now that you can 't use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't it yeah as i said we 're starting to have issues like um and it 's more pronounced in specific areas so i don 't want to pick on any particular area but if you think about white bay um white bay area in particular they 've had ins they 've had instances of reverse power flows through their substations for quite some time sorry do you think that in the future potentially the screen energy program might just look at the difference so that a house can be neutral with their electricity not overshooting their uh it 's a great question i can take it back to the product wise and answer the question yeah i don 't know it 's the product design per se but yeah you can ask the question yeah well it would make it make each house be able to get there yeah i 'll put something else out there too um at the moment everyone here um um pays for about 20 renewable energy house already so under the renewable energy target retailers have to source 20 of their energy from renewable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff um so there 's an argument to be made that you know everyone here has already got 20 mules coming into their house and that 's certainly conversation with business at the moment around particularly how do they how do you how do you determine targets so if you 're trying to get to 50 renewals spending 80 100 renewables do you account for the 20 that you 're already paying for or you sort of set that aside and say well that 's a regulatory requirement that i have to do something that 's you know not really you know i have to carry that i 'm not really doing anything extra so set that aside let 's go for 100 so yeah don 't think that you 're not paying for the rewards or anything it 's about time for tariffs do you think the future holds that we end up the future strategies are around the current network as we know it as a big network optimizer do you see it being much more small and networks was we 're in a meeting with one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the prophecy of the network death spiral is being overstated um in the it 's becoming a different kind of network so it 's it 's now a sort of two-way network that 's been designed to facilitate connection of large-scale renewals for example it 's been designed to allow people to complete the systems on their grooves so there is absolutely certain sections of the network that we will look to move to when we under standalone power systems so that 's you know your sort of solar battery diesel hybrid sort of arrangements that 's been driven largely by cost to serve really so if you think about long stringy swirl lines running out to you know out to the west to serve you know one or two customers that cost a lot of money to repair when they fall over is there a smart way so certainly everyone network as i think three standalone power systems up and running at the moment there 's a year of doing probably 10 or 11 of those a year um that 's obviously with a lot of consultation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to end up worse off either in terms of safety reliability so you don 't see it as community-based solutions in the future yeah my perspective of you know maintaining that trump infrastructure and you know building additional demands oh i think supply demand yeah i suppose my personal abuse network 's always going to be there yeah it will just be used for different things i think certainly you know there are a lot more micro grid um studies happening at the moment so i know we 're involved in one central month central highlands at some point where you know again coming back to that issue of generating locally and using locally um so how can we manage you know say perhaps you know if you were to take down the beach for example put the connection point back out on the highway um and then manage total load within the wood sun base through local sources right so what does that look like um how do you manage that who owns the assets so you know if we were to sort of take it back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know is that core business of a council for example is that something they want to get into um you know it 's expensive too well um yeah absolutely i think um and and i used to look after haman hamilton daydream when i was a customer manager a long time ago yeah absolutely um still connecting to the mainland there 's a nice other cable that runs out there um but yeah they have um uh challenges of their own to deal with i remember 10 years ago we were talking to hamad about australia what is about how could they allow their residents to connect solo i work there that 's my biggest issue yeah yeah basically they just say no because if they do it you got to power the whole place yeah yeah i said i 've never kept track of it three times so the conversation kicked off right towards the target in that role but yeah they were grappling with you know how do they manage your network yeah um and have all this sort of you know texture yeah coming in um how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have um they 're just trying to be managed by uh sort of private enterprise so that would be that 's your isolated network strategy working on those solutions for regional areas so did you say that 's what we 're going to need yeah yeah um the locations were chosen based on penetration of mules so um where there was a lot of solar where we were seeing instances of minimum demand issues so yeah there 's a view of rolling out a lot more i think we 've just started with five to understand how do you make them work because we went back to what you said before around 20 cents already built into the tariff and what have you and a small state of energy a long time ago and one of the debates where you saw it was when selling grey power did you need to sell 100 percent or could you take the average of what was on the network and sell based on that making an assumption so i was in wa so when uh [Music] so is that you know composition we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cost sensitive yeah yeah yeah you know how do we confidently when this is so they can you know have their focus but feel like they are contributing yeah i think the cost was absolutely an issue right so how do we get the green energy product price right as well yeah yeah we 've been having a lot of like so um fiona and i sit in the wholesale markets team within urban retail so obviously we have our trading team sort of sitting right next to us and um there 's been a lot of debate lately around um have we got that price right for example um but what we 're seeing too is um the price of lg seas has remained and the f5 guys might be able to comment on this too but like the price of lgc 's has remained quite buoyant in the last couple years it 's actually a lot higher than the forecast because the rat scan 's full so and that 's come about primarily by voldery surrendered by corporates that are trying to get targets themselves right so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate to their investors shareholders and the likelihood they 're playing role pt um so you 're right how do you you know is you know you have a slide up earlier around the percentage of renewables into the into the grid um yeah how can you account for that more broadly or product it 's fun times it 's it 's yeah like you don 't spend 17 years in a boring job um so it 's you know last six months in particular have been quite quite interesting for us another solid one before and again sorry for trusting my energy is it because of the um what you produce back on degree there is already benefit associated with certificates associated with solar is that why you can 't do the [Music] too so the soul that i 'm feeding is already salt essentially so then i need to make sure i 'm buying that green again which is obviously already twenty percent or so green seven i need [Music] as i said earlier around what 's the right number yeah we 're already got 20 tariffs i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the gap how do i make that yeah great okay we might leave it here thank you so much so introducing our next speaker as mattis chavery he has 10 years of experience in the renewable energy industry across engineering energy training and market management roles his focus is to help give life to more complex electricity contracting structures designed to face into the emerging risks in the national electricity market today these include negative prices transmission constraints and the replacement of traditional firm generation sources with variable renewable energy and storage so matters will be covering the whitsunday solar farm and have purchased this more can you please welcome thank you get started there all right so the opportunity for a local green tower so this is just some sort of back of the envelope calculations i pulled some data out of the from the australian energy market operator so don 't um don 't quote me too high but it should give you a bit of an idea of you know where things are at so last year queensland used about 53 terawatt hours of electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this region and said makai isaac what 's under region populations around 180 000 so is that right about that um yeah so that so in that region you you all use um 1.6 hours of energy that 's something like three percent of the queensland low and this electricity usage produces about 1.2 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions so if all of this electricity usage in the region was 100 renewable energy if you made 100 people energy would that do or would bring around 700 to 750 megawatts of new renewable energy projects into the region it would bring around one and a half billion dollars of private investment to the region it would bring thousands of construction jobs something like 40 plus full-time roles as well and you know lots of flow and affects the local community um supporting industries and economy philosophy you know people will have to come in they 'll fill up their fields with the car and eat food and all of that kind of thing so it helps the rest of the economy as well um so that just gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of people we talk about renewable energy and say oh look we get stuck on the cost but actually that has a really big impact on you you know bringing economic growth to an area as well so at a final energy who are we well we 're a we 're sort of an independent power producer where we sort of look at supporting the full life cycle of a project from from development structuring financing construction construction we minority own um the the projects that we build and then we also asset manage and sort of trade the energy outputs as well um so we we really try to align you know the long term interests our long long term interest with our investors so we 're sort of going to journey together um [Music] yeah so here 's some some more pictures telling the same thing so so we 've got you know six solar farms about 771 megawatts of um renewable energy throughout australia we 've got a battery energy storage project down in victoria 25 megawatts we 've we 've actually also built out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects we 've also built these things called synchronous condensers to help support voltage in an area between water and broken hill we 've also yeah like i said we trade the electricity that we produce we also have to keep an eye on regulations always changing um and therefore the the kind of you know renewable energy generators that we design has to has to work within that um we work with government we work with you know the communities that we that we build our projects in um and we 're also working on a green hydrogen project i 'm just sort of south of townsville which we 'll sort of touch on a little bit later um okay so here 's some pictures um so some of the solar farms that we 've um uh that are operational right now we 've got uh wick sunday hamilton daydream and heyman some familiar familiar names where i just realized they 're all islands [Music] um i don 't know if it 's still the biggest in australia but when we built it it was the biggest since yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah so just to give you an idea so that before good sunday daydream hamilton hayman before um local ireland um they 're all they 're all on some new collins book but um yeah so to give you an idea of the scale of these projects so those four projects together they cover 2 250 acres of land there 's a lot of solar panel sites like 1 630 kilometers that is up to about 520 kilometers of steel um during construction there was about 750 jobs over created for construction jobs to over an 18-month period we have about some 15 to 20 sort of fte workers where some of them are seasonal um and yeah so it obviously brings a lot of community benefits is that video going to work if you could well john would you suggest we do [Music] we can watch it later now we [Music] yeah just sort of um it 's sometimes a like this is a little video that um [Music] [Music] the video there was just showing um some of the local community talking about the community benefits that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on them all right um yeah let 's let 's keep going okay so um we 've those were our operational projects so we 've also got um quite a few sort of um local queensland projects within our pipeline that we 're looking to sort of get to financial close and then construct so um i won 't go through this in too much detail here but we 've got the what the lens down become industrial precinct project which has the hydrogen um green hydrogen facility within it um which is powered by a major major creek solar power station 250 megawatt um solar farm with um you know about 250 megawatt four hour battery smokey creek solar power station which is um further south um just milk of viola there uh 200 megawatt solar farm and crush creek energy storage system which is a big battery hundred megawatt four hour battery just um close to collinsville yep so here 's a bit of a map so that 's the major screen solar power station lands down here you need to run up to say lands down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoky creek down there in the south next to so here 's a little bit more um sort of data information about the leip which you know probably be just sharing the slides with others if you feel like i 'm happy you 're happy for the slides to be shared you can sort of go through a bit more detail if you like um but essentially yes this is the lens and eco industrial precinct inside of that um you know we 've got the major spring solar power stations which we intend to build a network out for which would give renewable energy to the um precinct and then um inside of that we 've also got development approval to build up to a one gigawatt green hydrogen facility so it is the electricity that we produce from the solar farm and produce green hydrogen inside of that facility we 've also got interest from a number of advanced manufacturing facilities that they wanted to use their green electricity to produce minerals and other advanced um manufacturing so it 's a new one um yeah so here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's some 11 000 new jobs if we can build all of this a lot of investment into the area innovation and sustainable sustainable electricity generation um and yeah that 's there 's a there 's a picture of our um edified hydrogen tanker the the what we 're aiming for there so um i 'll leave that there you guys can see through that in more detail if you 're interested um so what are the options so we 'll come back to sort of power purchase agreements um which we 've touched on a little bit already today but um just starting with the basics like what is a power purchase agreement world and and and i suppose how do they work um so first of all um when you buy a power purchase agreement electricity is still physically supplied to customers um through through the the national electricity market transmission system so that 's what is that well it the the national electricity market is a there 's a transition system that connects um queensland to new south wales to victoria south australia and tasmania there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loads to be actually separated they 're all just physically connected to the same system so when you buy our purchase agreement it 's actually just a financial contract where inside the contract it just specifies that the renewable energy capacity that you buy the length of the contract and a fixed price but you 're still getting electricity from the physically from the from the power system from the now so what do they do well pps bring certainty to both buyers and sellers in terms of price and there 's an important distinction to make with pbas because you can actually buy ppas from either operational um projects but if you do that you 've got to remember the project 's already operating you 're not actually reducing emissions in any way you 're not producing any extra renewable energy another type of ppa will actually underwrite help underwrite financing for a new renewable energy project and that actually you know will bring new investment into the area we 'll bring jobs into the community and and guess what you bring co2 emissions down as well um so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay do you want your pba from an operational project or do you want it from a new um you know a new new renewable energy project um so some other sort of considerations some basic thoughts that you have um so size um the bigger the better for for large-scale projects and the reason that is is is it it helps to achieve the the lowest financing cost and that for the project and that gets passed on to the customer um large-scale projects you know just to give you a sort of a bit of a rule of thumb yeah they tend to be greater than 50 megawatts um you know you 'll get some that are a little bit smaller than that but really they tend to be greater than 50 megawatts so to get to that kind of low um you really you probably need a consortium of some sort of businesses and potentially local councils working together to aggregate their load to get to that that size um in terms of 10 up the longer longer duration longer term contracts work best again because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that gets pushed on to the to the buyer to the customer so those are some of the some of the basics um now now in terms of risks like i said earlier the physical delivery of electricity comes from the national electricity market from the power system um so you 're not wholly dependent on the the project always supply and power which most most the time it will but you will actually have the physical grid to be able to support you and that also brings um a lot more security and reliability it 's set up to um manage um sort of voltage and frequency and constraints in the system so that um you know it 's it 's reliably supplying power to you at all times now there has been some instances in north queensland where um because of the nature of the grid here it 's a long stringing sort of connection to the rest of the power system there 's been times when it 's been separated from the rest of the system and so to that extent the more you can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the more it helps you just to keep the lights on locally basically so so that 's when we that 's where like the you know batteries become really important um because that can help really support that system when when you know you have large disturbances that might that might disconnect you from the rest of the power system okay so how do we um yeah so that 's the sort of physical stuff and then in terms of managing the financial risks um you know when you 're buying ppa you know your retailers like um like they 're going over here it can sort of help you if you can come together as a consortium get aggregate enough load the retailers can can help you sort of work out which which contracts are best for you um there 's also sort of energy brokers and consultants that can um back then uh advise on which which contract structure is best so we 'll continue on there so i 've got some stuff here about um like different types of power purchase agreements i won 't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information here you can sort of look at it if you want later um but essentially there 's two types there 's a virtual ppa in the sleep ppa um we 'll continue um so here 's some more um pictures to confuse the crap um so but essentially what they are look they 're just they 're just different ways to strike an agreement of financial contract with a renewable energy project and they help to bring you um certainty over price over a long period of time um so the virtual ppa it 's it 's really sort of it 's a bit more of a light touch um contract where you you basically have the same arrangements with your retailer and then you also get a ppa agreement with with the renewable energy project and then there 's some level of integration that you can discuss with your retailer to sort of make it work for you financially um a slave arrangement um actually we 'll go to the next one again the sleeve arrangement works a little bit differently where it says okay well if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for physical output and you 've bought your you know your retail contract let 's just pretend it 's a flat load that you have and then what it 'll do is it 'll just carve out that that solar generation out of the middle of the day for you and then we 'll just the retail events it 's their business how they how they fill up the rest of their energy around there so that that 's the way they manage it um [Music] yes here 's some other things to think about i won 't go into too much detail here um and there 's some contacts where you want to get in touch can you explain a little bit um for your future project at the crushed crash creek battery energy storage system yeah yeah so we 've um essentially it 's um we 've got some spare land and spare grid capacity on some of the existing projects that we 've already got there and what that allows us to do is um put together a battery energy storage system project which is which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration storage so it 's the total energy storage is 400 megawatt hours um and and we the the the sort of the design of that battery means that it 's it 's plugged into what we call advanced inverters grid forming inverters they um they 're able to manage the the power system um such that it can handle disturbances a lot better um and so that that brings a lot more reliability to the grid and so you can sort of um if you get a if you get a big fault which would otherwise potentially trip you up from the rest of the system the crash creek energy storage system will gives you a good chance of being able to stay keep the lights on um and and also recover recover the system to to normal that makes sense yeah that 's good how far are you advanced today yes okay thank you it 's awesome though is that is that purely going to be used in that kind of circumstance or will you be charging it every single day and running it down every like feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our modelling we assume we we sort of um fully charge and discharge it 365 days yeah 365 times in a year so would that essentially mean that if for example we have a disaster event and collinsville is cut off somewhere past your farm connection i don 't know exactly how it 's all connected yeah but that would give disaster resilience to that town resilience not just the town actually from from here all the way up to north north far north queensland it will definitely um it will definitely boost resilience yes is it enough to keep the lights on like collinsville it depends on the fault i don 't want to like over over because there 'll be some situations crashing lines or something happened during cyclone debbie yeah and then they couldn 't restore power to collinsville until that was fixed is that correct i know the power was actually yeah so i 'm just wondering if that would be enough to for them to be able to have power in those circumstances yeah so um like depending on there 's a few things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular hours that that 'll keep you know keep the lines on here for a certain amount of time yeah um if you 've also got renewable energy um a source of renewal renewable energy local which you which you do with the some of the projects that we 've we 've got here then that can that can definitely help in those situations yeah if you if you sort of get just disconnected like essentially there 's like there 's only a few 275 kv lines going south from here um and so if those disconnect then to the extent that you 've got a source of energy and and and a way of stabilizing that energy then you can sort of operate the north queensland system separately from from the rest of the grid until those that they can be reconnected again that makes sense it 's good that makes sense and it needs some of those other community based obligations we 're talking about before about i suppose more micro so it 's not while it 's not is that 's right so but but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yeah which i think every community is working towards that like all councils and everyone like the whole focus is resilience right now so of course there 's yeah thomas in with the local disaster management i understand that 's great yeah okay thanks so much [Music] welcome um we 're actually going to be introducing i 'll be introducing our third and final speaking of this morning so colin flatt he 's the director of green energy technologies the number three solar company in queensland connor is originally from canberra where he completed electrical and telecommunications training carried out work for optus on mobile towers and promote power requirements and it was at this time in 96 that he had his first console in 2005 after living in the uk for six years established green energy technologies in 2010 with an initial contract to install 200 systems for origin energy up the coastline green technologies have now installed over 10 000 solar systems throughout queensland and con is looking forward to taking queenslanders on the journey to the renewable energy future so please put your hands together uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back with rit putting that on today and thanks everyone for coming and everyone online uh yeah it 's uh it 's a pleasure to speak to you all today so i guess the the previous two speakers have spoken about more than networks uh today we 're talking about sort of more on-site assets um through green energy technology so what individuals can do uh businesses and individuals themselves on site uh so i 'll take you uh the presentation 's just gonna run through uh gdt uh a little bit about us um and then just a price point housekeeping statement just in regards to the energy network a few people sort of noticing changes on the network that 's going to be probably the norm on the network and then we 're just going to run through three ways to access solar energy on site which is upfront capital purchase lease to finance and ppa which is an on-site power purchase agreement similar to the virtual ones that i 've talked about before uh then the challenge is is your energy security and then some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah gt journey so there 's a little while looking like there on the left that was me in 2010 myself and james where both locals and good sunday started three energy technologies off here in 2010. like so we had an initial contract just to do some work for origen and we sort of feel we could do a better job so that 's how that 's how it kicked off we installed 480 kilowatts in that first year and our key clients at that time were retired retiring couples or people looking to set themselves up for retirement 44 feed-in tariff was a big thing back then future cost reductions and retirement planning uh the key detractor at that time was just general knowledge or fear about solar houses work those types of things in 2010 uh we expanded to makai in 2014 townsville in 2018 in brisbane uh just recently in 2020. um ergon sort of spoke about 690 000 customers with solar on the network we 've probably got about 15 000 of those people would be very involved with just to give you an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place last last year we were the third largest in queensland for stc which is the small scale system in stores so now we 've got 50 staff and the photo down below we installed 12 megawatts last year which would put us at number three and our key clients now are couples or family homeowners uh the key driver is energy savings and just momentum in regards to the industry where it 's going renewables uh investing for future the key detractor is is still just procrastination and that fear of change so they 're the main items that they 've seen our just so everyone doesn 't know like commercially wise like the the homeowners are still driving the majority of purchases in regards to solar on site we 've got about 85 of our clients are residential homeowners uh probably ten percent in the commercial space and then probably five percent fully off-grid so that 's that 's the sort of level uh where we 're at so in that business of commercial space it 's been a very hard decision for a lot of business owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of i guess the statement so continued inaction or misguided choices will propel us towards a disruptive energy future with increased grid failures less less reliable supply lower tile prices and significant environmental consequences so that was a report put together from a lot of governmental bodies by pricewaterhousecoopers in 2019. um and it 's basically i mean a lot of people tell you everyone is saying i said a lot of things happening in the network now and even in the last three months versus the last sort of 10 years there 's going to be a lot of things happening in that space and obviously the regional area which we are today there 's going to be a lot of things happening in that space it 's going to be really hard for for the people like irvine the distributors to hold the network together with the change lots of renewables coming out of the grid so there 's going to be a lot of change and there 's going to be a lot of risk for individuals and network holders to hold it all together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to happen for everybody to understand the change in what 's going on so what we 've seen for probably 50 years just getting a power bill and the price comes in it 's it 's there 's going to be a lot of movement in that space so it 's it 's there 's definitely some change on the light a little flick across so that 's my big fear get yourself sort of up about i 'll flick it across so um why solar energy and renewables so the main reason people are working with us i guess with on-site solar and renewables uh risk of starting with the norm so grid varnish has been a big one up in in northern queensland and obviously like edge of grid and things like that volatile pricing which has been pretty steady uh recently to be honest like it did go through a number of increases that has dropped probably over the last three years and looking to see a little bit of an increase reliability issues and negative environmental impacts i mean just so if we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's it 's actually the last reason that people come to us of those is the environmental impact so majority of people are going with us or proceeding because of the financial benefits or the security benefits of of of their asset not saying it 's not a reason but it 's it 's the last first of all the benefits of investing in the future so age protection guaranteed pricing greater greater reliability and the environmental impacts um so the biggest thing for that from our outside where our business has grown we 've had to show the financial case so we can 't we have never really affected a sale like i said that would keep our business going if we can 't show you that the impact will be beneficial in a financial level or a security level for your business or home so that 's how our business has been set up so it 's very rare that we would be recommending a renewable asset to someone that doesn 't give you a positive benefit financially and security-wise so at present solar on site is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of energy that 's six is very low 10 's probably more likely where it 's at um and that 's basically levels cost of energy means the the life of the asset that 's how much you would pay for the kilowatt hour so if you 're getting a domestic bill roughly about 20 cents at the moment for ergon uh commercial bills around 25 if you 're with the tariff 20 on ergon so that 's the sort of price you can get if you 're looking at a longer-term investment with an on-site asset and approximately i 've said 11 to 11 to 30 cents for the network retailers so that 's the space we 're operating in if you 're looking for services we 're always looking to give you a better better value for money for for your home or business or flip across the next one and these are the three most popular ways of accessing solar so i 've tried to sort of uh bookend our sort of location so there 's lit sundays right here that 's sort of far north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queensland so the upfront purchase is the most common one um council is sort of looking at lc however six cents but probably more likely eight to ten on that one upfront capital cost obviously for the general purchase and normally the best return on investment for those uh then we have the least or the finance scenarios so we 're generally looking at a cash positive solution so your savings should cover the cost of your lease if that makes sense so you 'll be ahead by anywhere from one dollar to sort of 20 grand a month no money up front and you can build the solution based on your savings as as discussed and then ppa which we sort of touched on with the other guys there that 's uh an on-site asset in a pba so someone else would own the asset for example and they 'd maintain it for you for a period of generally 10 years is what our most common one is it 's no cost to you at all you 're just purchasing the power that creates generally around the 10 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 20 kilowatts to give you an idea on that sort of level that 's that 's a ppa so the upfront purchase you you 've got funding or you 've got your own money there or you 're borrowing at a very good rate yourself and you 're getting a good roi at least or financially looking at the cash positive scenario so you 'd be ahead of the game on your lease and i am ppa you 've basically got no risk involved and you 're just purchasing power at a cheaper cost around 10 to 14 cents we 'll just flick it across and just go through through a couple of them there so this is an example of upfront purchase with uh with council uh this is this is not all our projects we 've done through a few local companies uh here so it 's just a basic breakdown of what it was at the time uh so richard regional council purchased approximately 400 kilowatts of solar across seven sites uh the savings it was at that time i 'm not sure what the bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars per year four to five year payback at 20 to 25 roi uh and at that time was a bit of an iconic roll out for the council i know looking at doing some more stuff um uh data for extension of roland further on so they do have a uh there 's actually a platform available online which uh it dropped off the website but there is a platform that will show you how much those assets are producing and can show how much council is generating in that space which bit of an image of it there so that 's that 's the upfront purchase and sort of benefits of it like four to five years later is probably the key item there for the rich bay council um we 'll flick to the next one uh so this is your lease or finance scenario so this is uh d depending on what type of tower especially commercially there 's a bit of a uh i guess a sweet spot for solar systems if you 're a large scale versus small scale this is one that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a small scale tariff rather than a large scale tower this one had a crazy return so these guys installed 40 kilowatts of solar and they 're getting about 50 000 difference in their savings the paybacks just under two years and cash positive from day one so that 's just one of those one of the ones where just the variation in tap so i think it was like sort of a larger scale where they 're paying around about sort of 40 odd cents per pound and now they 've dropped into 20 plus the solar gets the most those big savings with their aircons the main reason for that they 're looking at upfront purchase but because of covert they weren 't really able to sort of make that commitment uh the finance company energy ease it works off the asset itself so there 's no underlying holding on that it 's just the solar asset that 's the finance based on and they are able to reduce the terms to two years which is going to be paid off probably in about six months that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll flip across that 's the least scenario i guess test case known for at least and this is a ppa model so how many apartments in redcliffe have just gone ahead with the ppa power purchasing ground so our off the solar system on the roof the 40 kilowatt solar system for 12 cents a kilowatt hour uh they 're currently paying about 24 cents per kilowatt hour so they 're getting that at 50 cents 50 sorry less than what they 're doing obviously you want to size the system correctly so they 're not spilling too much energy because the feeding 's not great um the benefit of that again no upfront costs cheaper power costs from day one uh the option to own your system after the ppa term so that 's on a 10-year ppa and for a dollar they can own the system at the end of it so it 's sort of a free hit in regards to that uh all maintenance and service costs are nothing so that 's totally covered by the the system that owns it which is green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break down the worst case scenario they would just pay power as they normally would off so they don 't have to pay anything for the system if that makes sense uh that 's and that 's a pva model so that 's probably the the its least beneficial roi but if you 're looking to to not really have any impact on your costs or even on even on your your sort of capital cost side of things it 's it 's a total operating expense and you 're generally ahead of the game with no no real security issues we 'll flick through to the next one uh so they 're the main three reasons that we see as a business and then i guess the question was you know how how are we investigating our energy security what 's the questions that we should be looking at like i said there 's going to be a lot more integration with the grid digitalizing and those types of things so volatility around pricing and supply will be key issues for home and businesses more so in regional areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses with refrigeration and things like that where an outage could be costing 20 30 grand in one hit what we 've been comfortable with in the past could soon be extremely uncomfortable and stressful as the energy mix becomes decarbonised uh decentralized and digitized so that 's something we 're probably going to see the the ability for network providers to start using individual assets on the grid such as batteries large scale and even small scale like i said everyone did recently well probably a couple of years ago i did a little battery project up here in domestically uh which which i 'm not i 'm sure what happened with that there was a bit of a bit of a trial of that and you 'll probably see that sort of stuff go forward so us as a company like i said we 're committed to assisting the transition and forming and aiding locals with any decision towards that energy future and our goal is always to do that in a cash beneficial way for your sales homes and businesses before we get across and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked it off any questions you 've got plenty of time so you know another question on your ppa did you say you 're buying it at 14 cents a kilowatt hour yeah anywhere from so probably the lowest pba we do is probably around seven cents and up to around about 14 15 with the highest and when we 're paying our arms at the moment 28 probably about domestically you wouldn 't get many ppas because the size of the system 's probably too small so you 're looking at something around 20 kilowatts upwards so really large home or a small business yeah is there any sort of type of arrangements for well yeah yeah so generally what happens what we 've probably the most common way sorry is probably a better way to put it is let 's say you had a 50 kilowatt system on on an existing property and you want to put another 50 kilowatt in but you wanted to go to ppa normally uh the pva would buy that 50 kilowatts back off you wouldn 't study the energy of the juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 they take over that 50 uh by back off you can probably sell you the total energy added for maybe sort of nine cents or something like that that 's that 's generally how would that take over the maintenance and i 'm going to that as well and manage that whole thing as a pdo that 's the most common yeah that always gets to be complicated yeah what 's interesting i 'm doing the thumbs up thinking that you get a freedom of 7.8 cents cost out is 28 but on a contract you can buy it for 14. with homes it doesn 't really stack up on a pga yeah because of the feeding and with the business it only really stacks up when you when you 're building around not feeding back that makes sense yeah so generally the same i mean once you in ergon specifically once you hit that 30 kilowatt threshold you 're not in a space where you get automatic feedback so you need to be under that size that was the other thing i was going to mention because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to feed in like skills and all sorts yeah it 's like because you 're over that threshold of either size or you 're using over 100 000 kilowatts a year [Music] yeah so it works really well for businesses like nine to five businesses seven days a week that have got a heavy load during the day you can size the system really well very minimal feedback and i said it 's under 30 kilowatts you can get a bit of feedback for it but that 's that 's generally where you 're looking at is to get your bank back in those in those key areas so maybe 50 percent of your bills so you is is where you 're trying to target and that 's you see opportunities for like a half a dozen homeowners to get together for a ppa uh yeah you could but again generally with homeowners most homeowners want to go slightly bigger that makes sense so if you did go slightly bigger and you 've got a like a group ppa in you 're gonna have a lot of feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again where it isn 't worthwhile like i said it 's definitely worthwhile if you if you 're looking for a free hit as such where you 're not not investing anything get the money stacks up those types of things but when you look at that it 's sort of on the edge of feedback and those types of things that 's where it 's where you could come unstuck because if you go too big or you 're away for a couple of weeks and things like that and you 're not paying more in your pda than you might have paid on your power mean it 's not that he can 't do it it 's just yeah it 's just a lot of work in regards to setting the loads up on those types of things thank you any more questions can i make a comment i know i 'm not supposed to probably shouldn 't be fighting bring energy technologies but going back 10 12 years you guys install this over on the roof and your people ask where 's the best place to

first uh webinar to kick off this series my name is justine bell james so i 'm an academic in the law school at uq i 'm a lawyer by background and my my background 's in environmental law climate change adaptation and climate change law more generally just one other housekeeping matter to mention before we get into the meat of what we 're looking at today i 'm very happy to answer questions during the talk and the way for you to ask questions is to type them into the chat box which is down in the right hand corner of the screen so please feel free to type in a question if you 've got one or keep an eye on the chat box as we 're going along and i 'll endeavor to answer any questions and then there will be some time for a question and answer session at the end as well all right so uh yeah as i mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning uh i have put up some resources in the shared files section of uh the platform here so feel free to have a look at them i 've also written a book on climate change and coastal development law and an end calf information manual on legal risk which would be quite useful for local government i have put the ncf manual up in the shared file so that 's something you may want to look at my work these days focuses more on coastal ecosystems like mangroves and salt marsh which is still very relevant to adaptation they 're very important from an adaptation perspective because they provide buffering services to the coast but today i 'll be going much much more broadly than that and talking about climate change adaptation and law much more generally just thinking a little bit about adaptation i think it 's beyond doubt now that some degree of climate change impacts are locked in and the extent to which we 're going to see climate change impacts really depends on what 's done in the short to medium term to mitigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely going to be necessary and if we look at something like the paris agreement that 's really critical because it 's the first time that adaptation has been elevated to the same level as mitigation and that was really because adaptation was previously thought of as defeatist if we shift our focus to adaptation we 're admitting that we can 't solve the problem but i think it 's well recognized now that a good approach to climate change really needs to encompass both mitigation and adaptation so climate change impacts that may require adaptation too includes things like sea level rise and other coastal hazards increased flooding risk increased bushfire risk and increased heat risk and what i 'll be focusing on today is the sea level rise and flooding context that 's where my expertise lies and i think it 's where i can probably offer you the most useful information uh but a lot of the the legal issues that we look at are much more broadly transferable anyway so hopefully it will be of interest to you even if that 's not your core business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerpoint slides that are up on the screen now so again if you 're having any problems with that please let me know in the chat box down the bottom there so adaptation raises some complex issues for local government so at the planning law level it depends on which state you 're coming from as to how much state government direction you have so for example if you are in tasmania you have the fairly prescriptive state planning scheme whereas the queensland state government policy gives you a higher degree of discretion with the opportunity for more discretion sorry the more detail at the local level there are also property law issues that you need to think about so you 're likely to have complicated legacy issues in your jurisdiction including residential developments that are in at-risk zones and perhaps also things like sea walls or other coastal defense mechanisms in areas which you now deem are inappropriate for this type of development so you 've got planning law issues you 've got property law issues and you 're also likely to be encountering new applications for development in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit about what issues that raises in terms of your legal liability so to try to categorize these issues i 've done a rough diagram which is what you can see on the screen now this isn 't comprehensive i can 't cover all legal issues within 20 minutes but i think this is a snapshot of the major issues that councils and local government need to be thinking about in terms of climate change adaptation and i prefer to divide the legal issues up between existing developments and new developments under consideration as the legal issues for these two different categories are quite distinct and you 'll see that the other distinction i 've made here is between residences and other sorts of construction and building uh and things like sea walls and other defensive structures because again the physical location of these sorts of structures and their purpose uh gives rise to different legal issues okay so these are roughly the four different categories of things that we 'll be looking at today so i like to start with looking at dealing with new developments so new applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with so when you 're deciding whether to approve a development or not you are making the decision under your applicable law and policy framework and this framework may do one of two things so it might be directive so if a certain risk is posed to a development your planning law regime may require you to reject it so for example you might have mapping in place that maps at risk zones linked to a planning scheme that directs you to reject development in an area mapped as being at risk alternatively you might have a regime that allows for discretion so it may require you to consider a risk but ultimately make the decision that you feel is appropriate in the circumstances it 's quite difficult to sue government for failure to make policy but decisions made under a bad policy are something that is certainly open to challenge and that 's what i 'm going to talk a bit more about today so looking at directive planning frameworks so if you 've got a planning framework in place that essentially tells you what you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit easier provided it directs you to make a good decision it limits the risk of a legal challenge as you have complied with the law and there is little scope to challenge that and as i said it 's quite difficult to challenge policy but individual distillation individual decisions rather are much more vulnerable to challenge so if you want strong protection for the decisions you are making you should be pushing for strong laws at the council level directive planning schemes might refuse you to require your rather to refuse development in an area at risk or even zone an area as unsuitable for development meaning that you might not even have development applications arise in the first place there 's also novel solutions like planned retreat that are an example of a more flexible approach but still one set out in a more directive planning framework as well in contrast if you 've got a discretionary planning framework or a discretionary planning scheme it may use language like consider or have regard to so you need to consider a certain risk when making a decision but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision that you make this is where matters can potentially get a bit challenging for council so saying no to a development at this point in time might be unpopular with the developer and this decision might be challenged in court so you might have this immediate legal risk of a developer asking that your decision be overturned under either merits or judicial review depending on what your legal regime and your state allows for but saying yes to a development when the data suggests that it 's a bad idea under future climate change also raises legal risks so it might remove that immediate legal challenge from a developer but it 's potentially creating a much bigger legal problem in the future and i acknowledge in saying this that it 's really not easy being a decision maker in this circumstance because unfortunately saying either yes or no to development carries a legal risk it carries the potential for your government to end up in court but if you say yes to development that the data suggests should not go ahead council might find themselves sued in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against council for negligence so for example by a property owner who experiences severe flooding and they argue that the council had that information at the time they made the decision a court will consider the state of knowledge at the time the decision was made and if there is evidence that council had knowledge of climate risks and made a decision that did not reflect those risks that will put council on a very bad decision and uh i 've got a a reference here on the slide to an article that is available in the files that i 've posted in the room that talks about this particular issue in more detail but if your planning scheme obliges you to consider or have regard to an issue you need to give genuine consideration to that as part of your obligation in assessing a development application and what that means in the future is that when a court 's looking at the state of your knowledge there is direct evidence that you had that knowledge before you so that is going to make it very very difficult for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future so the conclusion that leads to is it 's really important to make the best decision you can on the information before you even if that does mean making a developer unhappy in the short term but far and away the best thing you can have is a strong and robust planning scheme that allows you to make a climate friendly decision without undue fear of legal challenge all right moving on to looking at sea walls and other coastal development coastal protection structures so this is another area in which to exercise caution so a sea wall for example may seem like a good way to allow development in an at-risk area but there are also issues that may give rise to a liability risk so sea walls may cause exacerbated coastal hazards for other properties uh it may also restrict the landward migration of coastal wetlands meaning that they are effectively squeezed out of the landscape and these are really important uh resources for things like climate mitigation flood mitigation fish habitat etc and finally even well-designed structures can fail and the problem there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety and you might end up with more intensified development in an area because of it and if a sea wall fails in those circumstances the results can be really catastrophic and new orleans is a really classic example of that where there was very very intense development uh that turned out to not be protected as well as was thought so there 's quite a few different risks that you need to think about when you 're dealing with something like a sea wall and of course i 'm not an expert in the engineering side of that but you do need to be cautious when approving these if you really want to be approving sea walls and allowing developers to put forward proposal to sea walls you need to be really cautious to make sure you are assessing risks to neighboring properties and other properties and the natural environment as well so if a sea wall or some sort of alteration to coastal processes would for example increase erosion for a neighbor then there is potential for council to be sued in negligence or nuisance for your action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of impact on a wetland or a protected species that lives in that wetland this may put you in contravention of some sort of environmental legislation as well so it 's really crucial to know what risks apply so that you can avoid them so if you 're looking at approving one of these structures there 's a lot of information you need to be getting to make sure that you can reduce your legal risk there you should also be thinking about imposing management obligations on the owner and ensuring that this is done in a way that will bind successes in title so making sure that any future owner of the property is also required to undertake those management obligations as well so for example depending on what jurisdiction you 're in you might be able to register a covenant over the land and again i 've put a reference on the slide here to an article that deals with this in a lot more detail and i 've shared this in the files within the chat room so do have a look at that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at existing developments and i 'm also going to draw that distinction here between residences and other buildings and sea walls as well so existing developments are trickier to deal with the new developments the time to make the best decision has passed and you might be left with significant legacy issues within your council that you need to be thinking about in terms of liability to be sued in court for negligent approval of the development so if something was approved in the past and there are now some sort of hazards materializing that are affecting the property again like i mentioned before liability would depend on your level of knowledge at the time of development so if you 've got development that was approved long before climate risk information became known then it would be quite difficult to mount a claim in negligence there so that 's something that is potentially good news it 's obviously not ideal that constituents within your area are having their properties flooded though so what can you do about that there is a presumption against retrospectivity so you can 't order people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order people to do that you could perhaps explore whether there are any opportunities to encourage it or take opportunities to get people to retrofit when damage occurs so for example in the united states under their national flood insurance scheme this requires that if a structure is damaged to a particular threshold due to a flood it has to be rebuilt to a better standard and this is a way of gradually increasing resilience and stopping repetitive damage from occurring aside from that it 's really difficult to get any sort of retrofitting undertaken and this leads to a situation where people might be losing their homes or experiencing significant damage to their homes or other buildings and council may not technically attract any legal liability but it 's obviously not a great strategy politically and the experience that we 've got with riverine flooding in australia certainly demonstrates that australian governments have absorbed the cost of flood events to private property in the past particularly in circumstances where landholders are uninsured or underinsured and there 's a lot of research around this phenomenon and research has shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election the more a government might be willing to put forward in terms of disaster relief and again this might not be a situation where there is a clear legal obligation for government to act uh but there 's political pressure and moral and ethical obligations so can you then think about spreading the cost of these sorts of things of retrofitting properties or acquiring the worst affected ones there is an upcoming webinar on finance so this might help you to figure out how to pay for this but the bottom line is that experience shows governments do pay somehow and this needs to be thought about and sorry i 'm just going to pause for a moment to read a question in the chat box yeah that 's a good question ian i think it certainly is getting to a point where it 's really difficult to argue uh that you would not have that risk information certainly so i think if you are approving a development now in an area that is quite clearly projected to be subject to a significant risk in the future it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know this might be quite a way in the future it might be 50 years down the track that the property is affected and the land holder decides to sue for negligence but it is the knowledge at the time so yes i think you 're right it is getting to a point where um you know councils do have such a high degree of knowledge available to them it would be really difficult to make that argument all right if we look at existing developments in the case of sea walls and i 've mentioned here legal or illegal sea walls and the reason why i said that is a report that was prepared a few years ago for the sydney coastal councils group estimated that there are thousands of kilometres of unlawfully constructed coastal protection works around the australian coast and uh on the side here are just some of the ones that i 've come across there are of course legally constructed seawalls and some of the issues i discussed today will also be relevant to them but the illegal ones probably throw up some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before that is available in the files deals with all of these issues as well so do have a read of that if you 're particularly interested in sea walls and coastal protection structures if you 're dealing with particularly as i said an illegally constructed coastal defense structure it might not have been designed or constructed properly for a start and i think as we can see from the pictures here perhaps some of the ones here have not been correctly designed or constructed even if it was correctly designed or constructed there are no arrangements in place for things like inspection maintenance and repair of the structure because it did not go through that planning process there 's the risk that an illegal structure might fail causing damage to the property it 's intended to project protect and or to adjacent properties as well and also of concern there 's a risk that a defective sea wall might cause personal injury or death particularly in circumstances where it 's easily accessible by members of the public so you 've got that risk as well and finally these illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be causing adverse impacts for other coastal properties all of these scenarios all of these things if they occur could potentially result in your government being sued again in negligence in these circumstances awareness will be relevant so if a local government is aware of a risk and fails to act on it that 's something that a court would consider in making their uh judgment on whether or not you 've acted negligently so in a really classic negligence case piranesi council and day and this is mentioned in the article that i referenced before council had inspected a fireplace in a private premise and determined it was a fire danger they had ordered the tenant to fix the fireplace before it was used again but the notice was not sent to the owner and the council did not subsequently follow up on the matter a subsequent tenant used the fireplace both the building and the building next door caught fire and burned down and council is held to be liable in negligence with the court focusing on council 's awareness of the risk and their power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a risk and power to do something about it are critical and in the case of an illegally constructed sea wall uh all governments in australia would have power to do something about it and the the specifics of that power is referenced in that article that i 've linked to you what if you are not aware of these illegal structures should you be aware of these structures so let 's say someone is injured or their property is damaged due to an illegal sea wall and the person who built it is broke or unidentified or has moved away and a person sues council alleging that they should have regularly inspected the coast and acted on any of these structures this is where a court will look at the reasonableness of your more general counsel procedures and operations so for example did you have some sort of inspection and maintenance schedule for these areas did you have a policy dealing with it were was there any particular budget limitation that affected your ability to do these things and this might help if you can show that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take into account and there certainly is legislation in every jurisdiction across australia that imports uh that for a court to look at when they 're looking at the actions of a government the fact that you are operating under resource constraints you have a lot of things to do and you don 't have money to do all of it so there certainly is an element of reasonableness there but a court will look at that within the broader context of of risk as well if you do become aware of an illegal structure what can you do to manage your legal risk there 's a few different things you could do you could order removal of the structure but this could something that 's problematic so if the owner 's home or land is then affected by erosion or sea level rise you could be sued by them but you also need to think of the wider consequences so if the sea wall will increase coastal hazards for other properties then they might sue you so again this is unfortunately one of those areas where you probably can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of action that you take you could require retrospective assessment of the seawall and this is an opportunity to get things like engineering reports check that the design and the construction was right and also use this stage to impose conditions regarding maintenance and repair and again this would be a way to shift the legal risk from the council and again for more detail on that have a look at that article that shared in the files so what to think about this has been a really quick uh overview of some some fairly complicated legal matters first and foremost think about limiting your future risk so you all know about climate change now which i mentioned before uh in response to ian 's first question sorry and i 'll get your second question just in a moment uh so you all know about climate change risk now and it will make it really difficult to avoid risk in the future so make good decisions now and push for good protective policy now and then start thinking strategically about managing your long-term legacy risk so when coastal hazards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time this could be a massive cost bomb for government so you need to start thinking strategically about measures to spread this cost and that 's probably a good place to stop the formal part of my talk today and as i mentioned before your next webinar will be with ian edwards talking about finance so hopefully ian can can pick up on that theme that i 've left there so just moving to this first question we 've got from ian then are there any examples of how courts are distinguishing between what is climate change related and what is bushfire flood tides etc uh look there 's there 's not too much yet in this vein to be honest ian it 's really early days for for seeing anything before the courts it 's it 's much more um something that 's going to happen in the future so a lot of what we talk about in terms of how courts will look at this is is quite speculative but um you know we can just think about what we know about the law right now which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there any circumstances where legal liability negligence extends beyond council to councillors and the executive leadership team um that 's a tricky question i think it 's one of those issues i suppose where you 'd look at whether the people making the decision were acting within the scope of what they were employed to do so i think particularly if we 're dealing with employees certainly if it 's within the scope of what they 're employed to do they would be covered looking more at councils of the executive leadership team that 's oh that 's that 's a tricky area i 'm not sure that 's within my expertise i 'm afraid ian all right i see someone else is typing so i 'll just wait a moment it 's okay and thank you for asking the questions does council have any obligations to release information related to its climate change risk that 's an interesting area because i suppose one of the concerns that uh governments have perhaps had in relation to this information is that they release it and it 's incorrect and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misrepresentation do they have an obligation to release it per se um i think it 's difficult to say that there 's a duty to one of the risk i think it 's probably good to be sharing that information and you can probably deal with the issue i mentioned of information that perhaps isn 't quite right by using disclaimers and i think when we 're dealing with projections of future risk it 's you can 't predict 100 what 's going to happen down the track because there 's so many variables that goes into it so communicating that uncertainty is obviously something that 's really important um but sharing information i think is is quite important all right any other questions was everyone able to find the files that i mentioned that i 've shared if you 've had any trouble with that please let me know i think ian might be taking you to those files now all right got another question coming oh they seem to have moved okay it wasn 't a question it 's a comment so ian is tracking down the files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there any other questions or comments in the meantime so um did you have any luck finding the files there ian hi justine and everybody i 'm tracking down those files um yeah um if they if i can 't find them then i 'll send them out uh at the end of the webinar great thank you yeah i uploaded them beforehand but that box seems to have disappeared since we started the chat that 's all right um i suppose the just to chime in last question are there any obligations from a mitigation perspective for a council are there any legal requirements or is that more just a for the ethical moral category yeah definitely the latter there 's no strict legal obligations to be undertaking any sort of mitigation action um obviously it 's a good thing if that 's something you can be doing um whether things will arise in the future in terms of lawsuits against government for failing to mitigate potentially it 's something that hasn 't happened in australia yet it 's something that i don 't see succeeding in australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate litigation is a uh evolving feast so whether it 's something that happens in the future perhaps,"(-20.4018362, 148.5832116)"

any business perhaps would want to be educated about and perhaps be able to implement within there within their business structure so so welcome to you all just a bit of housekeeping before we get into the our guest speakers today if you do need to use the bathroom they 're located outside on the right hand side on the same level our emergency exits are the same way that you came into the building and this session is designed to run until around about 12 o 'clock however we have given ourselves an extra half an hour in our q a session at the end with our panels so we 've got lots of time if you 've got questions if you could please hold off for those questions until the end of the session it would be much appreciated for those of you who are online we are working with our tech issue at the moment but you will have the opportunity to ask questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please there is a chat box on the youtube platform that you can actually enter your questions we 'll be checking those questions through the morning and we 'll be posing those questions to the panel at the end so if you do know the friend who 's joining us via live stream it may be worthwhile sending them a quick text message perhaps to say hold on it 's hold on there don 't don 't log off we 're working on the sound and it 'll be on shortly also to uh do a welcome to country uh with sunday regional council acknowledges the traditional owners of this land and pay our respect to their elders past present and emerging and all aboriginal and torres strait islanders living in our community today for they help the memories the traditions and the cultures of their people okay so without further ado i 'm going to actually invite olivia brodhurst to to come and come up here to chat about the hub about some of the initiatives uh one in particular the whitsunda healthy heart project which is close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely she 'll be covering what 's what it 's all about what the hub 's up to and why we 've brought these special guest speakers to the region today so if you could please welcome olivia all right it 's great to see everyone here there 's some familiar faces and some new faces so that 's really exciting to see that um all the effort that we 're putting into trying to build this collaboration is really starting to build momentum and start to really spark that interest and cross-collaboration and pollination of ideas in the region really so i wanted to give a really quick um update from the hub i don 't want to take up much time so i want to get into the media stuff of the of the day but just for those that aren 't that familiar with the climate hub the climate change innovation hub is an initiative of whitsunday regional council it was formed in 2018. it is a little bit different to council standard operations in that we also report to an advisory panel made up of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance legal climate adaptation etc so i have an amazing panel um that i can go to with questions and ask for advice so they guide the advisory panel are they glide guide the climate hub the climate pub is part of council 's organizational structure so that is really one of our strengths is that we look to fill knowledge gaps for council to help the region become more resilient and adapt to climate change but we tap into research organizations and then we really have the ability to try and make sure that the research is really practical and can be rolled out on the ground so the researchers see that as an advantage to working with the climate hub and vice versa council can see that advantage coming through to really underpin what they 're doing with really factual science especially with the changing climate the mission of the climate hub is to build the resilience of the whitsundays and communities everywhere to climate change so we look to run projects locally for local benefit but also to share our knowledge and engage quite widely so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through those collaborations as well and we always are looking to upscale and kind of and and learn from each other so it 's really is kind of an action collaboration and we are looking to try and share everything we 're doing that 's why one of the key things from today 's event was to make sure that we 're filming and we 're making it available to other people as well because we 're all facing similar issues up and down the queensland coast and with decarbonising so i wouldn 't be the coordinator of the climate hub without giving you a little update on climate change so i 've put a little graph here and you can see from 1750 from the start of the industrial revolution you can see how carbon emissions have gone up when i say carbon emissions everything 's kind of turned into a carbon dioxide equivalent emission but it could be methane carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and other gases so you can see there that the increase is really um going up quite steep there at the edge of that curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions is that we 're at 414 parts per million so it was 280 in 1750 so it 's ramping up very quickly the change that we 're seeing in the environment average temperatures around the world have already increased about a degree and everyone would have heard that we 're trying to cap it at 1.5 maybe two um to really um curb climate change and protect the environment so we 're already seeing a lot of global average temperature change of about a degree sea levels are rising around a centimeter a year we 're predicted here to have 80 centimeters to 1.2 meters of climb of sea level rise by 2100 so we 're planning for that at the moment within council rainfall is changing in seasonality rain is coming all at once our cyclones are coming less frequently but more intensely so we 've had cyclone debbie five years ago now so you know that that was a really big unprecedented event so we 're likely to see more of those style events um and obviously with the with sea level rise we 're getting more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well has already increased quite a lot so it 's quite a small scale but the oceans are already acidifying cold waters are more affected by ocean acidification than warm waters so areas that are further to the south are already starting to experience shelled organisms starting to deteriorate because of increased acidity in the water all right so this is why it matters this is the um what will happen at one and a half degrees what will happen at two degrees and what 's the difference between the two so you can see here one really big one for us is this one here with the coral reefs with one and a half degrees of warming we 're expecting to see a 17 to 90 percent decline in coral reefs and with two degrees we 're up at 99 so obviously there 's a lot of other things that are affecting the reef so it 's changing the biodiversity of the reef and which species can survive etc as well so we 're starting to see all those changes coming through and with coral bleaching etc also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high emissions trajectory we 've just had the cop 26 happen in glasgow and leaders around the world were discussing plans to try and decarbonize so there has been some good things come out of that meeting but obviously it all needs to come into play now and they actually need to take those actions that they 've committed to climate change is the number one biggest threat to the reef that 's why our tourism industry is very very very much wanting to do everything that they can to make sure that they are decarbonizing to protect the reef and our council is also committed to reducing carbon emissions and council has committed to carbon neutral by 2050 and is currently planning how they 're going to achieve that the witsana healthy heart project is the project that is leading the work with the tourism sector and it 's also looking to achieve a sustainable destination accreditation this is a project funded by the great barrier reef foundation and with sunday council together through the project we 're looking to engage with 30 operators every year so 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc four or four years time span and looking at um engaging with operators including marinas island resorts and people actually out taking people on boats and tours to help them to understand their carbon footprint measure it set some targets and then decarbonize those this is one of the workshops that will help them to understand how that can be achieved sometimes things like fuel is it 's a big emissions but it 's a really hard one to address because that 's your high cost piece of equipment that most people have invested in for quite a long time span so that 's why we wanted to start to bring this information into the region share what other people are doing around the world and start to have that conversations about how we can uptake more future fuels and greener engines in the future all right so we have started the project in march this year and so far we have 22 healthy heart reef partners engaged in the project so we were aiming for 30 new ones so there 's still space for another eight to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we 're starting to write some case studies about what people are doing so that we can share information within the group and we have started noticing a lot of collaboration increasing between different people sharing how they 've managed to overcome different barriers so the project is only in its early days and we will be looking to try and keep ramping that project up and sharing more information as we go so without further ado though i think that 's the end of my presentation okay that 's okay i don 't have any sound that 's my last slide right well we will move to our first presentation slot i believe now so we have frank we have frank hubs in fact you want to come up we have frank hopson joining us from ricochet yachting he is the director of ricochet yachting and him and his team are providing hamilton island and the whitsundays with premier luxury yacht experiences frank has spent his whole life on or under the ocean his professional yachting career has spanned 25 years traveling the globe as a master on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yachts frank has spent several years in command of different billionaires yachts including richard branson 's private yacht necker bell from his beginning as a fifth generation commercial fish fisherman in the bass strait of australia to running superiots throughout the caribbean mediterranean and pacific frank has retained his professionalism and continues to ensure a high standard of excellence in the pursuit for a zero emissions marine tourism vessel so i 'm just going to pass over to frank thank you olivia thanks for joining us thank you and thank you to to lee and olivia and organizing this event it 's a fantastic platform to talk about renewable energy and in particular zero emissions in the tourism industry and that 's what we would like to talk about i would like to talk about today now forgive me when i 'm normally addressing an audience of this size it 's for a safety briefing so if i break out into a life jacket demonstration or give you directions on how to use a marine toilet forgive me it 's just force of habit so hydrogen what can it do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and renewable hydrogen in particular offers a fuel source that is zero emissions so when we make hydrogen or green hydrogen it 's using renewable energy and then we use it leaving a zero carbon footprint so that 's very important um we might are we able to play the first little little vid um yeah we can play the first video it doesn 't require sound just the first part of it the first um [Laughter] thank you uh or we can move to the vessel straight away should we do that go to the website if you want to check out your audio because it doesn 't require any um actual audio so um h2 rendezvous is our our company and and our new design for the first zero emissions um hydrogen fueled uh vessel or tourism vessel and um it 's been in development for over four years so five five years ago we had the option to expand our business and to move into a larger vessel at the current vessel as a sailing boat and to move into a larger vessel which was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when i thought about it i just couldn 't do it it just wasn 't the future the the fact that i was going to deliver 650 tons of carbon dioxide into the environment every year through this venture it just didn 't sit right with me so my naval architect and i we started working on what are the possible alternatives and we were looking at batteries you know that was we thought it was a viable option but we soon found out very quickly that the amount of batteries we require for a boat to go out to the reef and back will the boat would have sunk at the dock okay and even though with the technology advances in battery storage and capability batteries will never be that long that large storage capacity for vessels running out that amount of horsepower out to the reef and back so the next alternative we looked at was uh was hydrogen and the hydrogen fuel cell actually provides the basis to provide those kilowatts that we need okay and we can talk a little bit more about the vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project is a world first a great barrier reef tourism vessel that is stylish and luxurious in every detail and powered by 100 clean green renewable energy produced locally in the which sundays and that 's an important part too of this whole project it 's about doing everything locally so our sunshine that 's out there shining not so much today but uh 90 percent of the time on uh on queensland can be turned into hydrogen okay and aaron will talk more about that in the next presentation about how that 's going to happen and the different kind of industries it 's going to um to bring into the production of hydrogen so there 's there 's one shot of rendezvous there are we able just to scroll up at all guys so i can just check out what i 'm talking about excellent um and it 's going to offer offer a unique experience and unique experience so the you step aboard find your your sun bed and relax the dock lines are dropped and the vessel leaves its birth in total silence no rumbling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleek hulls cutting through the water this tool will be a completely unique experience and one that will be remembered for a lifetime just imagine that you know when you first going to board this vessel it makes no noise and takes you out to the out to the reef amongst the islands renovateur will be the first vessel of its kind and the future of marine tourism queensland has the opportunity to host the first hydrogen powered zero emission renewable energy tourism vessel and that 's about starting a brand okay that 's about promoting our area as a green tourism hub okay and other other operators joining us and and transitioning their vessels over to hydrogen fuel cells and combinations of hybrid um battery fuel cell smaller vessels and leaf form from evoy outboards we 'll talk a little bit more about that in the in the last presentation the installation of the first hydra production and storage and delivery facility in the whitsunday region and other and others in central queensland with the construction of the first hydrogen powered commercial marine tourism vessel is a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm excited to hear from aaron in the next presentation about how we 're going to produce hydrogen here in the whitsundays are we able to scroll down a little bit please guys stand to the next picture and the next set of information you might have to zoom out a little bit because the information 's on the side okay this will this will do so zero emissions one of the key components of the successful success of hd rendezvous project is that a reliable sustainable access to green hydrogen it 's critical that multiple independent memorandums of understanding concerning supply and purchase agreements will with local multifaceted hydrogen production companies will establish to ensure a consistent daily supply so you know where the diesel is you can come down here and get your diesel here it 's readily available and it 's readily available everywhere so if this is going to be a success it 's really important that we that new operators or operators using hydrogen have that supply and a part of our pro program is actually to not just offer hydrogen for us to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just not limited to buses to boats either it 's the buses and cars also so we 're going to our first phase of our program is actually to have a hydrogen tube trailer and refueller so um this this uh tube trailer will go out to places like uh like aaron 's uh development out there uh his hydra facility and other facilities around the central queensland and fill up with hydrogen and then deliver it basically to where it 's needed so if i need it at shoot harbour it can come to shithub and i can refuel if a bus needs it out at the airport it can refuel and if a vessel here it requires hydrogen it can refill so it 's a portable storage transport and refueling device and that 's quite key in the initial stages of offering hydrogen to this region are we able to scroll down a little bit or go to where are we okay excellent fantastic a notion of opportunity for queensland tourism businesses and community climate change is both a risk and an opportunity too big to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural resources and and the transition towards a decarbonized global economy are highly relevant for tourism a strategic plan underpins ambitious actions and will support queensland 's tourism industry to respond to climate risks and opportunities against the background of a wider queensland policy framework on climate change building a resistant tourism industry and was it was it was made clear in the queensland 's tourism and climate change response plan um it provides a road map for the tourism industry to respond proactively to climate change and lead the way as a steward for the environment and a key contributor to the community well-being all right we might just go to the uh to the second pay if we go up to the top and then move to the second page of the uh of the web page there we go i will go to about and we 'll just scroll down a little bit down to the project details excellent thank you all right so um we 'll just scroll down to this point just here please because that 's already been covered there are two separate components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the um the the first wave will have that 400 kilogram refueller and that 'll travel to where the where the hydrogen 's required and the second of course is the construction of the purpose-built hydrogen-powered commercial tourism vessel and the cost of this construction and refueller and basically any first step towards getting into renewable [Music] vessels and buses is going to require co-contribution from government and that 's extremely important and queensland has been on the front foot of this and we 're hopefully to see the the commonwealth do the same and be able to help companies like myself to be able to bring this technology to fruition and into action because obviously the cost of a diesel vessel compared to a fuel cell vessel in the initial stages is a very big price difference and that that cost is prohibitive and that 's why we haven 't seen these vessels out there just yet and also the fact that the technology is only starting to catch up to us now to allow this to happen uh yeah so the vessel itself rendezvous we 're powered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests and offer high speed into with sunday island transfer service and marine tourism operation including snorkeling on the great barrier reef one of it will travel at speeds of 24 or four knots could be able to go back to thank you uh and it 's been designed us for a deliver a smoother ride mismo minimizing passive discomfort and the after the open water so these are the key points if we go just down a little bit further so these are thank you um the h2 run over project will establish several supply agreements with local uh uh queensland green hydrogen supply networks uh we 'll construct a 20 metre vessel on time and on budget in queensland we 'll also have that uh 400 kilogram mobile hydrant refueler um on site the same obviously the same time as the vessels delivered if not before and we wanted to create that local sustain a new new workforce so a gas feeder that 's probably working in the coal mines now will quickly turn to a gas fitter of hydrogen they 're very similar to both gases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the commonwealth are coming to deal with hydrogen coming into our industry in all industries and this is such an important job creator so we will see in the next two decades uh hydrogen exports start to replace our exports of coal um japan and south korea have uh have got a massive need for hydrogen and we 've got the ability to produce it so that 's that 's really important transition um as i mentioned before just this one hour one vessel which is an extremely efficient vessel by running it on not on fossil fuels and on hydrogen will reduce our own emissions by our 650 tonnes per year obviously the vessel will demonstrate the successful application of hydrogen in the marine transport industry and encourage further use of hydrogen as a viable zero-emission fuel also this vessel will be the catalyst to the new future fuels marine regulation allowing the transition of australian commercial vessels over to hydrogen so we 've got to write rules basically and the government is on board with that and we 're working very closely with them as we speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans in place to ensure the safe use of this fuel have we got the next page folks which is the next page on the website or we can have a look at the boat really quickly there we go so that 's a bit of a uh the current design of of the 20 meter version and you can see all these tanks inside what we call the wind deck and that 's the hydrogen in those tanks and the development of the tanks themselves and every part is moving so fast at the moment these take takes away 100 kilos each and we just started to talk to a supplier that 's got new technology and they 're going to reduce that by about 80 so down to about 20 to 30 kilos so this technology is moving so fast what we 're designing now will be so much more efficient and better in the future uh all righty where are we we might just go down to merit details if that 's a that 's okay okay so we 've collaborated with some of the best people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now and one very important gentleman that 's um who 's been a fantastic supporter and a great sounding board has been dr ian mckinnon from um from the queensland who 's queensland strategic hydrogen advisor at qut and some of the comments that we just grabbed from from ann which we find fantastic and extremely encouraging there is a strategic opportunity for a new hydrogen industry to advance queensland 's priority for creating jobs in a strong economy and the world 's response to climate change we need to draw on our natural advantages to meet our growing international demand for cleaner energy recent technological advances in the production storage and transport of hydrogen have renewed global interest in this as in its potential as a renewable energy carrier and talking about the rendezvous project he says i agree with you that the opportunity uh to propose a use of refueling capacities that encompasses hydrogen production and the shoot harbor marine terminal in the future is an example for australia the the capacity to cater for the next generation transport using low co2 for renewable energy based hydrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marine craft will be innovative environmentally sustainable and consist and be consistent with the premier tourism region of australia and again it comes back we 've got such an asset here in the whitsundays being known for its its beautiful islands and reef wouldn 't it be fantastic to bring another level on top of that which we 're green we 're sustainable with zero emissions that 's a whole new level of tourism and you know it would be fantastic to be known internationally if you come to the sundays you 're going to have a low carbon footprint and have an experience that you won 't get anywhere else in the world whether you 're relying on fossil fuels and diesel engines so it 's about that transition it 's about which sundays being on the front foot of that and we 're definitely spear spurring that ahead a little bit further down he might have something else to say of of interest oh excellent yeah excellent um yeah let 's let 's go let 's go with that excellent here we go the advances in technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we okay so how powerful is hydrogen you know when we 're talking about hydrogen being a replacement for diesel i 'll show you how powerful it is press play so these are fully loaded trucks diesel at the top hydrogen fuels on the bottom and we might just pause there i know which one i 'd like to be stuck behind okay that 's three years ago okay and right now hyundai is manufacturing thousands of these trucks and they 're going into service and they 'll be here very soon okay there 's other truck manufacturers that we can speak about we 're going to what how far we i didn 't keep my timer how far we 're in there a few minutes okay so um i 've talked a lot about fuel cells but it 's important you understand how they work okay because it might not make much sense so i 'll introduce albert bergman from hyundai he 's got a very strong european accent so we can trust him he 's very factual and we 'll let him have a bit of a chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when did the hydrogen fuel cell start its career the first remarkable application of hydrogen fuel cells started in the 1960s for satellites and spacecraft of the gemini and apollo programs we expected that bringing hydrogen fuel cells to the public would not be easy nonetheless honda motor group anticipated the future potential of hydrogen fuel cell at an early stage in 1998 yunnai started to develop a hydrofuture car and has made continuous efforts to make significant progress to the present day in february 2013 tucson fcev was released for the first time in the world opening the door to the mass production of fuel cell levees then in 2018 under released the next generation hydrogen fuel cell suv nexon our nexo is ranked as the fcev with the most sales worldwide but we didn 't stop there we plan to use our fuels leds in various fields first is the key to logistics trucks the big challenges in long-haul zero emission heavy-duty truck operation is refueling time and range the zero emission powertrain our action fuel cell truck consists of two nexo fuel cell systems a hybrid high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hyundai action fuel cell truck is the first mass-produced heavy-duty fuel cell truck in the world and started operating in switzerland last summer okay so hydrogen economy is dependent on four key successes okay hydrogen production hydrogen storage and fuel cell technology and infrastructure such as transportation of that hydrogen the whitsundays has access to all four of these technologies right now so what is a fuel cell and how does it work basically a fuel cell is a power generator like an engine a fuel cell differs from a battery which stores electricity a fuel cell system consists of a fuel cell stack that generates electricity a hydrogen supply system an air system and a heat exchanger it generates power by combining hydrogen and oxygen but without the carbon emissions unlike a battery that passively stores energy are we still playing through chemical reactions uh it operates as long as hydrogen is fuel is supplied to the fuel cell the science is simple a fuel cell is just a reverse reaction of water electrolysis that we all learnt in year 8 science class the core competitiveness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important for cost is the reduction is the stack i should say there 's 400 cells combined in a stack and the cost of this part accounts for the largest portion the structure of the fuel cell is shown in this figure the cell consists of two bipolar plates which provide the flow channels for hydrogen and oxygen and that supports the structure of the stack two gas uh diffusion layers are here and a membrane electrode which is called the m e a the mea forms the the core part of the fuel cell and is the key component that generates electricity caused by causing a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in the past the high cost of fuel cells has made the use of them in the marine transport sector prohibitive until now however in 2006 the cost was reduced by half and then the cost of the first generation fuel cell system installed in the first mass produced two significance f cev in 2013 was 10 of the first model and developed developed 10 years before and now you can see in this graph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prototype cost so these costs are falling so it 's going to be accessible to all of us that 's why we 're going to have fuel cell cars alrighty the average durability of fuel cell stacks at the time was only 821 hours which is only half one half year durability you can see through this progression that we 'll see that the durability of a fuel cell has turned to forty thousand one hundred thousand kilometers and now we 're at 160 000 kilometers and then the target which we 're working on in the next fuel cells is to 500 000 to a million kilometers we 're getting a little short on time so we might just pau pause that there and i 'll just close on on a couple of key remarks um is that other video it goes for 10 seconds is that there cause it 's called little fairy this is this morning if we have a listen to this that 's 71 decibels of noise it doesn 't have to be that way okay we can change over to fuel cells with zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just hope that rendezvous will be out in the water in the coming years and prove the point that we can move over to zero emissions and the tourism industry thank you thank you frank that was that was great i hope you 've got some questions i asked frank at the end of the session because he will be sticking around yep fantastic so thanks for uh bearing with us too through the tech we 're we 're pretty much on top of it now so i 'm very very pleased to to be inviting up our second speaker um and uh he 's come from all the way from western australia so a huge effort to be here with us really appreciate the time he 's taken to come over here and share this his company 's um journey but a bit of background about aaron first he grew up in coastal country town in the in the north of western australia a town dominated by mining and salt industries and the new player in town woodside this is where his 30-plus year career in the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustainable results across a range of roles from technical operational and management to leadership delivering safe and successful operational business units and projects in 2018 aaron commenced his career transition a genuine desire and drive to contribute positively to a cleaner future researching the emerging green hydrogen economy and the opportunities that it presents and research that led to the creation of the h2 energy company in 2019 so please a warm welcome for aaron smith does that hold well thanks very much for the introduction firstly i 'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land that we 're meeting on today and pay my respects to elders past present and emerging and i thank lee and olivia for the opportunity to speak today and the coral sea academy marina and the clean innovation hub for hosting today 's event nearly there so today i 'm just going to provide a i 've been requested to write a brief introduction to htm energy company and who we are i 'll provide a intro into green hydrogen and renewable hydrogen add to a little bit of what frank educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunday 's renewable energy project provide an update on the timeline associated with that and then we 'll talk a little bit about the challenges and opportunities that the green hydrogen industry offers australia so h2 energy company is an independent integrated renewable green hydrogen production distribution company so we have a build-on operate model which means we 'll build and own the renewable energy we 'll build and own the green hydrogen production and storage equipment and we 'll also distribute the product to our customers and the main purpose of that is to ensure we have a traceable green renewable product to our customers in gaseous hydrogen as lee said we were founded in march 2019 we have a look back one sorry we have a leadership team of four with greater than 115 years experience in the energy and infrastructure sectors with three of us having worked together for more than 15 years together in the energy sector successfully we are active in western australia new south wales and queensland with our first project being here in the whitsundays okay we 're ready to go so what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green hydrogen i 'll just touch on it again so renewable green hydrogen in essence is hydrogen gas produced using renewable electricity which powers an electrolyzer the output electrolyzer is hydrogen gas and oxygen we then compress that hydrogen store it and look to distribute that to our customers there are many means to transport that to our customers one being via pipelines at the moment we can blend that to a certain percentage for existing infrastructure and then also we have the road and rail options to distribute to the customers there are a number of different colors of hydrogen i think every color of the rainbow at the moment has a for hydrogen but i 'll touch on only a couple today so the primary about 95 98 of hydrogen that 's produced globally at the moment is from fossil fueled process called steam methane reforming we call that grey hydrogen blue hydrogen is using the same process steam methane reforming however they capture the co2 emissions and and store those and as frank said green hydrogen is is a zero emission energy source energy carrier and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and also for industry and the feedstock to industry being primarily being ammonia and steel manufacturer next slide thanks the story so far in australia whilst hydrogen is globally available today the zero emission hydrogen story began in australia in august 2018 with the release of the csiro national roadmap and from there as you can see from this page every state in australia at the moment has an action plan a strategy or a road map to bring to life the hydrogen economy there are i 've lost count of the number of prospective projects in australia but there 's likely to be between two and three hundred prospective projects being considered for development around australia at the moment in most in every state from very small to very large pilot to demonstration projects including and there are only a handful of projects at the moment that are actually in operation in terms of zero emission hydrogen next slide so moving on to focusing about use case potential use cases frank 's taught a lot about this today so i won 't harper too long on it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globally commercialized in operation at the moment primarily in the states and europe they range from varying sizes of course right up to the mf hydro which was the ship of the year this year recently awarded that 's a 82 metre this one here is 82 meter 299 packs 80 passenger cars in europe they are fueled either by liquefied hydrogen gaseous hydrogen or in the case of the hydro bingo in japan which was the first one launched allegedly in australia in the world that 's actually a dual fuel diesel hydrogen internal combustion engine drive ferry so it has a significant reduction in emissions associated with that so moving from the commercialized and in operation fairies we move into the pleasure boating similar to to what frank 's looking at in terms of catamarans and the like we have the hinova out of france which is available for pre-order if you go to their website the aquan also out of switzerland the cataran is under development at the moment so certainly the the interest is or the commercialization is coming for these vessels in europe and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what the future may look like very exciting yep okay frank uh gave us all a university degree on fuel cells and how they work so i went hard too much on that other than to say that so frank mentioned hyundai they 're also toyota and many other manufacturers that are manufacturing fuel cells at the moment for marine applications the zero emission as frank said they 're silent very clean and the only mission is water with a little bit of heat associated with that they 're modular so they can start from the tens of kilowatts through to megawatts so it can fulfill many applications in the marine sector they can be hybridized so you can include as frank said you can include a fuel cell with your diesel engine and your current battery electric system advantages with that if you don 't use it for propulsion other when you 're at anchor you can operate very silently with no emissions with power being sourced from the fuel cell and that 's it thank you next slide okay refueling um we 've refueling not too dissimilar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks etc at the moment in terms of refueling are you with a with with the nozzles and hoses etcetera but with the marine aspect obviously we we 're operating in a marina or a port etc so there are a few other options we have the portable options we can bring the skid to location hose and and nozzle to to the vessel we can have the mobile refuelers which frank was talking about so you can transport the hydrogen around with the refueling with the hrs off take uh and the high pressure the trial was carried out this year between myanmar and toyota and what they trialled was the a 700 bar which is the same pressure hydrogen gas that 's used in the passenger vehicles at the moment on the road they use that as a trial with a very long prototype hose which is this one here in a psycho bay to demonstrate that high pressure gaseous hydrogen can be fueled with a long hose to a marine vessel so it is happening and it 's happening around the globe and then again there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of europe a conceptual design in a floating it 's actually a production storage and offloading facility for marinas etc etc so very exciting so over and above the opportunity that frank 's talking about the marine sector and frank did touch on it there are other opportunities for the region to decarbonise across that whole tourism supply chain and that is an on island and an off island opportunity so at the moment we have two cars certified for australian roads and in use at the moment being the toyota mira and the hyundai nexo there are actually five honda nexos with the queensland government at the moment in the state within their fleet very exciting news the late october for the launch of the first hydrogen fueled or powered haison coach this one here was launched late october in queensland they partnered with blk auto to deliver that bus those bus is going to be 10 of those buses coming to the country or coaches should i say come into the country and they 're destined for a mine in western australia north of western australia so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot environment similar to here and the dusty environment of the mines we have many trucks available now as frank said you 've got the hyundai excellence and you have highs on have australian approved class a trucks available prime movers and we have material handling forklifts tens of thousands of these in operation in the states at the moment in europe hydrogen fueled we also have yard tractors in ports under trial on the port of rotterdam so in operation at the moment and we have heister developing reach stackers for container movements of ports etc so it 's all happening and it 's happening very very quickly as frank said further to that we also have stationary fuel cells so not just the fuel cells for marine applications we have stationary applications where we can have one two megawatts of fuel cells available in containers to displace uh diesel power generation on island or off ireland so again very quiet zero emission opportunity there next slide thanks okay a little bit about uh our wits sunday 's renewable energy project so we the project will be located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a a forward-looking innovative partner in top shelf international top shelf international are an asx listed company and looking at a distilling company and are looking to distill agave spirit in the region for the domestic and international markets they 're very keen and supportive of activating the hydrogen market in the region and will adopt hydrogen technology at their farm and for distribution where it makes sense obviously they have about over 400 000 agave plants planted already they started planting in 2020 and they 're going to a million plants over the next few years the target for first distilling for the agave distillery will be the second half of 23 so we need to have our renewable energy power ready for them so we 've been tasked to provide the renewable energy and hydrogen for the facility we 'll have the power the facility will be distilling hydrogen in the second half of 23 for the domestic and export markets and we 'll have hydrogen falling very closely in the same so second half 23 hydrogen will be available green hydrogen will be available in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love to service frank with the hydrogen in the region again a very local supply and it all makes very much sense we will be active trying to promote hydrogen for trials within the region we 'll have on offer a mobile refueling station and product for the uptake of the technology next slide thank you okay moving on for from just general challenges with the hydrogen sector frank 's touched on a few of those uh as you can see here we 've got from an industry perspective we have a chicken and egg issue where there isn 't a lot of supply at the moment and there isn 't a lot of demand because there isn 't a lot of infrastructure to fuel the technology that 's available as frank said there is they are high capital costs for the core components of the production of green hydrogen being an electrolyzer and the fuel cells are still very high costs associated with those and we can 't produce hydrogen that is competitive with fossil fuels at the moment in terms of policies and regulations um there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's 270 lines of legislation i think it needs to be amended to to help us activate the hydrogen economy appropriately in the future and of course look with any emerging and nascent industries such as the zero emission hydrogen industry there is a a bunch of familiarity that needs to occur with government industry the general public and the communities in which you operate so it 's very important from a as a producer to have our social license and maintain our social license to operate in the communities that we operate there are skills and knowledge gaps as frank said but these are very easily overcome we 're very highly skilled technical nation so we 'll overcome those very easily and if we look it 's all a bit of a mess isn 't it if we look at um i guess challenges associated if we narrow it down to the region in particular the chicken and egg issue we are looking at overcoming that with demand from frank top shelf and providing the infrastructure and supply costs will costs will take they will come down they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down quite quickly we expect that to continue similar to that of the solar and wind hardware what also benefits our cost of product to customers is scale so if we have larger demand we have larger production there is economies of scale with our production equipment etc so we can provide a lower unit cost to our customers we have a very supportive queensland government when it comes to policy and regulation so the queensland government released their hydrogen strategy in 2019 they are a member of the zero carbon certification scheme which is very important to h2ec and that is a scheme that is looking to be able to capture and record the carbon intensity associated with the production of hydrogen so as a green renewable hydrogen company that 's very important to us and it 's great to see that the queensland government is a member of that and there are a number of initiatives in place at the moment to overcome or enable the social acceptance of hydrogen in the wider community through innovation hubs hydrogen clusters across the nation and we 're a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a number of working groups that we 're a member of in terms of the hydrogen industry working group which is industry and tertiary education etc and we expect that these challenges should be overcome within five to ten years if not sooner there 's significant political and social pressure to decarbonize as we as we all know at the moment and a lot of positive industry appetite to deliver this economy going forward next slide thanks exciting there we go thanks so where there 's challenges it 's obviously opportunities so we see many many opportunities with the zero emission green hydrogen and yes the hydrogen barbecue does exist so we can buy those if you need those right now they 're being used around australia at the moment of course it comes a new industry and nascent entry comes with new skills new jobs and and that those jobs are offered across the whole value chain that can include the manufacture of the servicing as well as the operation and distribution etc it is a significant opportunity for australia domestically and globally as frank said as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it does offer resilience and diversity in your energy needs particularly in remote and off-grid locations and as i said before it has a wide range of applications and it does offer zero emissions we 've touched on that many times today but when using a fuel cell there are zero emissions and it does reduce the harmful particulates the noxus and the soxes associated with diesel and horrible smelly fumes over and above all of that it does offer energy security so they might rely a lot of on imports of our fossil fuels so producing hydrogen locally does improve this energy security in australia and finally i 'd just like to highlight a decarbonisation study that was carried out on four islands in the whit sundays it was a report initiated by the department of environment science it was issued in march 21 this year that was carried out by energetics they looked at four islands a great report looked at all options to decarbonise the islands and some recommendations that came out of that report uh suggested that we should look at feasibility studies associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on island transport next slide thank you so just like to thank everybody for your attention today with sundays in green hydrogen this is a real opportunity to decarbonize on ireland and off ireland we will have green hydrogen here from 2023 we are very open to talking to prospective partners to get to activate this region it 's a very exciting time thank you thank you aaron that was a really interesting presentation i love the idea of a great barbecue every single house in australia could have a hydrogen barbecue um get rid of the natural gas which um is kind of marketed a bit wrong because natural gas is actually predominantly methane which is one of the most toxic greenhouse gases so a hydrogen barbecue would be a great step forward for all of us in our households so that would be excellent so i 'm sure you 've all learned a lot from aaron 's presentation and thank you for joining us we will have the paddle session at the end but we 're just going to take a little minute break if anyone wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just setting up the next presentation there um video conferencing in so we 'll just take a second and test that assistant and the reason why much [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] [Music] uh is research [Music] money [Music] the next one it makes them [Music] [Music] reaction that 's who wow [Music] they 're very efficient [Music] [Music] um [Music] is um [Music] is electricity [Music] awesome [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] [Music] foreign so [Music] very busy [Music] [Music] [Music] oh there it is [Music] welcome back everybody and uh we are we 've managed to get our next speaker on and she 's going to be presenting remotely regarding the queensland hydrogen strategy and fund this is rachel uden she is the director of the hydrogen delivery unit from the department of energy and public works so she 'll be stepping you through the strategy and what it means for us and thank you rachel i 'll just hand this over to you now all right thanks very much for the introduction olivia it 's great to see so many people at the meeting up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person but unfortunately as a government employee i can 't always justify travel to some of the state 's most beautiful spots so i 'm going to run through i guess an overview of the queensland hydrogen industry and it 's great that our other two speakers today have done a very good job introducing i guess hydrogen technology just let me know if this sounds not very clear to everybody in the room i 'm having a few i guess technical hurdles this morning um right so i think there was a little we saw a little video just before about the hyundai nexo so this is one of the highly dimxos that is in australia i think there 's just over 30 all together most of them have been purchased by the act government but queensland bought five and that was um as part of a project with boc and i guess qut were involved as well for some federal specimen federal funding so that was that photo was taken with the brisbane lions women 's team and the assistant minister is in that photo um as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicles probably a couple of months ago now so the queensland government launched their strategy back in 2019 for the hydrogen industry development and since that time even though that was just two years ago there has been a huge level of interest and announcement activity and some of the projects that you may have heard about that have been announced by the government this year include the building of electoralizers to be done in gladstone which is by affordable industries that was announced about a month ago and then a collaboration between rio tinto and sumatomo who have signed an mou to use renewable hydrogen in their refinery also in gladstone arc energy up in townsville arc energy you 're part of korea zinc the world 's largest zinc company and arc energy together with their sister company townsville logistics and some medals all of them are part of the careers inc family have got a fantastic project up there to fully decarbonize their zinc refinery as well as use renewable energy to power their hydrogen fuel cell trucks and i think we saw a great video earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazon 's truck but there 's a couple of heavy vehicle manufacturers now getting into hydrogen hydrogen fuel cells so arc energy will be i 'm pretty sure the first project in australia to get hydrogen fuel cell trucks and they 'll be going from the port of townsville to the refinery taking their decarbonised zinc for use overseas and edify energy is another project up in townsville that recently received development approval from the council they 're still taking a few boxes up there but that 's another another big townsville project so between townsville and gladstone there is loads of activity happening all of it is large scale unlike i guess the ricochet yawning proposal that we heard about earlier which is a bit more of a small local demand story which is equally important and that 's just a bit of background around the strategy five focus areas um supporting innovation facilitating private sector investment ensuring an effective policy framework for sustainable development building community awareness and confidence which for us like this are incredibly important for that and facilitating skills development for new technologies um and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategy and it 's an important part of what the queensland government is investing in at the moment with some training infrastructure in gladstone townsville and in brisbane that will facilitate skills and training for hydrogen and renewable energy jobs okay so a major part of the hydrogen industry strategy was the announcement of the hydrogen industry development fund and a number of high-profile projects including um sun medals up in townsville received grants from that fund and here are some of some of the projects you can see here so arc energy up in townsville lower sun metals for their electrolyzer then in gladstone australian gas networks are doing a pilot project to blend hydrogen into the existing domestic gas network that project is underway um they are currently in the midst of their go through their development application with the local council uh gatton which is a suburb down here in the western far west and outskirts of brisbane um close to towaba that 's the university of queensland campus and they would like to have a zero emissions hydrogen fuel cell bus that could take students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden garden campus which is a big agricultural college so the idea is to have a re hydrogen refueller in brisbane and also out of gatton and that will refuel the that will refill their hydrogen bus and then i guess an exciting one particularly for the whitsundays region is spices scenic rim so the audience may not be aware that spices is a um eco tourism brand that 's very popular particularly in the southeast corner of queensland i 'm not sure if they 've got anything in the northern areas of the state but they have they are extremely high-end very expensive um ecotourism lodges in the wilderness so i think they 've got they 've got a couple in the scenic room area in brisbane and there 's i think there 's a few others oh there 's one in bruises they 're very young yeah very high-end beautiful i 've never been i can 't afford to go um these eco cabins were a recipient of the hydrogen industry development fund because of course there 's nothing worse that you get into this five star three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hear is the diesel generator that 's carrying your lights and you know it 's probably not a tv lights and probably facilities in terms of toilets and showers so they much like ricocheting wanting to do completely emissions-free energy for the eco cabins so they 've got a little solar farm with quite a big sole farm at new warwick in southern queensland and that 's how they 'll use then they 're developing the technology using what 's called the largo system um to have almost like a little mini microgrid that will power power these eco cabins so that 's that 's also in development it 's not work it 's not up and running quite yet but i know the solar farm i 'm pretty sure the solar farm will be connected um to the storage facilities in the very near future so read on two earlier this year the palate government announced round two of the hydrogen industry development fund and this time instead of it just being open to a lot of big range of projects the government decided that there are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the big international companies are looking at the export picture but it would be real it 's really helpful on a number of levels for as has already been touched on today for us to talk to try and stimulate domestic demand so the two areas of the fund and mobility and wastewater treatment plans so we haven 't announced the recipients of that fund for round two they 're currently being evaluated and due diligence is being done on the applicants but i think hopefully fingers crossed before the end of the year ministers will be prepared to make an announcement a decision will have been made by government on which which projects will be recipients of that fund so stay tuned for specific side and developments there and as well as the hydrogen industry development fund the department of state development local government industry and planning does a whole lot of other stuff that 's really helpful from a hydrogen industry development perspective um they include project facilitation so there 's a policy within the queensland government that um we call it a no wrong door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or write to your ideas for a hydrogen industry related project will get to the right department and that 's either the department of energy and public works which is me or my colleagues in the department of state development local government industry and planning to jackie and fleur who are right here in the room with me so i guess looking at that there 's also an investor toolkit which is pretty handy because this is all new renewable the area of renewable hydrogen is new getting equipment in the country is not particularly easy getting planning approval for new projects is never particularly easy doesn 't matter if it 's an eco-tourism resort on great kevlar island or anything with sundays getting a project up off the ground is not easy so an investor toolkit is on the department of state development website and that gives you some handy handy hints and a guide into how to how to start a way to look for more information strategic land planning um often with the hydrogen projects you 're going to need well it 's if you 're using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and regulations that you need to abide by if you 're looking at doing anything near the ports there 's also rules that you need to abide by and queensland has got strategic land holdings that are i guess kept aside for particular projects that are going to help emerging industries or that are of use in a particular area so that 's that can be helpful there the high capability portal is actually a federal government tool that 's that 's really useful in connecting hydrogen proponents with other government departments as well as industry groups such as httq um it 's one example and the australian hydrogen council um there 's probably a handful of groups industry industry related groups that can be really useful in terms of finding out finding out information about other projects finding out information about technology and finding out about more what 's going on right around the country the hydrogen and renewable energy jobs fund is a bit trickier [Music] that 's really for government-owned corporations to be part of so you need to be a partner partner with a government-owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies but that might be revised again looking looking down the track um at future rounds so the hype that the renewable energy jobs fund was really established in order to help the government-owned corporations that at the moment are very focused on fossil fuels transition into future fuels so it was to provide an avenue for them to apply for funding with industry partners to to help transition and the queensland jobs fund is again another another bucket of money that if your project is going to be supersizing jobs particularly in regional queensland then these guys wanted queensland treasury wants to hear from you um making queensland hydrogen ready okay so there 's a couple of things government 's doing in addition to allocating money to viable projects um and that 's around the regulatory and policy space so earlier this year minister de bruyne who 's the energy minister announced that he was forming hydrogen task force so the task force is made up of government and non-government members and it 's their role to really look at some of the major projects such as the export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can stimulate domestic demand um to get that to get the industry up off the ground and i think one of the speakers earlier alluded to the chicken and egg scenario of supply and demand we want to make sure that both those areas are stimulated and if queensland can be a customer then it 's also really helpful for some of our biggest suppliers and also across the state maybe smaller suppliers as well because hydrogen fuel cells have got a huge range of applications from remote power sources as we saw with the spices group through to heavy haulage trucks and also wastewater treatment the queensland government regulatory working group is made up of all the regulators across safety petroleum and gas land and any other anything else that needs a regulation which is pretty much anything um it requires a license or certification so that this working group is an officer level group which is really looking at as as some of these projects come across the table such as the hydrogen blending project up in up in gladstone it will be the regulators that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications of an electrolyzer for example or how much gas how much hydrogen can the pipeline sustain to be safe when it 's blended with the existing gas supply and what rules are governing that from a national perspective what rules govern that from a state perspective and what are the implications do rules do rules and regulations need to change to accommodate some of these new uses for hydrogen commonwealth working groups again across the country there 's so much happening and it 's a little bit it 's a little bit like covered um it 's interesting to see how the federation works when there are dif sorry there are different rules in each state so similarly with coved and each state having a different approach to their restrictions and border closures the commonwealth working group is trying to make sure that around australia we 've all got the same rules for we 've all got the same rules for things such as gas blending so that we don 't have a different rule in south australia so australian gas networks isn 't having a different sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to queensland unless there 's environmental reasons for doing so community reasons for doing so it makes it things much much easier for industry partners if we can all have the same rules across the country and the renewable energy zones are there on the map so again i think it was earlier this year 145 million dollars was earmarked for transmission to boost the renewable production in three zones in australia and in queensland northern central and southern so you guys are in the northern key red zone you can see on the map you 'll be just north there in makai so if anyone wants to build a wind farm um go for it because you 'll be getting subsidized on um your connection to the grid so as long as this and this aligns with the queensland government 's strategy to boost renewables by 50 by 2030 so we 're trying to incorporate as much renewable energy into the state grid and the national grid um by 2030 so in order to do that we need more soil farms and a lot more wind farms just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank feedback for the wind farm but um yeah we 'll definitely need both going forward so those zones have been set up to to make it attractive to investors to to build their renewable energy projects across the state skills and training i think i alluded to a couple of these um aspects before 32.6 million dollars for training that consists of the apprenticeship center in bean league which is the um we 're doing in conjunction with the plumbers industry center for climate action i think it 's called is the full name um so that 's that 's very focused on trades particularly gas fitting and plumbing and hydrogen and renewable energy training facility in townsville that will be delivered by tafe the bowling tafe and gladstone state high school i think got two million dollars following the last state election for again transitioning students to trades but also to science-based careers in university through central queensland university and the universities across the country looking at the chemical engineering and process engineering involved that we 're going to need to build both export scale hydrogen facilities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions for things like remote remote area renewable energy arrays and hydrogen production that 's the end so for further information all all of those things that i 've touched on can be found at the state development website so i think the first portal of call for anyone who has questions about the queensland state government and the hydrogen industry should check out the state development webpage and if there 's any questions you can email us at hydrogen at queensland.gov okay we 're just going to go to the channel sure okay thank you to everybody for understanding uh that i 'm not there today that i had to be stuck in brisbane i appreciate it thank you thanks for um sticking with us with the technology so we 'll open the room um to the panel um does anybody have any questions they would like to ask now the way this will work is i 'll be running around passing the microphone to you so we can get a nice clear signal through for the youtube recording that 's correct matt so is there anybody who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question i 've got is is relation to the the fuel cells and how they work and and actually create propulsion um just correct me i understand that the fuel cell basically makes electricity and then the electricity would drive an electric motor is that correct yeah yeah sorry thanks lee yeah that 's 100 correct so um the field the hydrogen goes into the fuel cell and mixes with the air and oxygen 's in the air and that chemical reaction creates electricity and a lot of electricity okay now that electricity can go straight into an electric motor or it can go via a battery and then into an electric motor and that kind of battery hybrid solution is a real winner for the smaller boats that are out here such as the ocean rafting boats and things like that because what will happen is when that ocean that that vessel is at the anchorage that fuel cell is still going okay and it 's going to be pumping um recharged energy into the battery and then finally when that that vessel comes back to the dock it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the marine is getting renewable energy and then overnight that battery can top all the way back up with renewable energy and go out the next day and it 's using that hybrid and what that means for smaller vessels is it means that that 's a reality now so we 've um about 10 years ago we had a lagoon 42 which was a battery operated shaft drive two electric motors i 'm basically operating operator for gen set um look it probably was too early for its time and it wasn 't successful and the boat 's still operating today it 's uh with another fleet um and they 're converted unfortunately back to diesel but you know if you had a reliable fuel cell um you 'd swap your genset out you would use your existing bat your existing um your your electric motors to drive the shafts um the other question i 've got is how much heat do these fuel cells give off and how hard would they be to retrofit in a you know an existing boat that possibly needs a new engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah a couple of key points there um firstly um you know the largest ships are going around the world that they don 't have a diesel engine that 's connected to a shaft that drives it along okay they have huge generators that generate electricity and then they need that power for all the domestic things that are going on on that ship but also they need it for their propulsion so we can apply the same thinking but to our vessels that we 're talking about right now so you 'd have that fuel cell creating the electricity you require to recharge the batteries and your domestic use and it 's just there all the time as far as retrofitting for propulsion um obviously it 's going to be easier to build from from the start with having fuel cells and making sure you 're ticking all the safety management plans that need to go in all the new regulation that 's going to come into place but the first thing that will happen as far as retrofitting will be a fuel cell that sits on the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is refilled or exchanged and that will remove the generator on the vessel so all these overnight boats are happening out now you know right now they can they can change over very very quickly to have a fuel cell generate their power and be silent in the anchorage and that 's that 's a big winner and that also has flow-on effects to other industries like the commercial fishing industry they use huge amounts of power to refrigerate and snap freeze their prawns and other produce so it 's going to be a major and major thing excellent did that answer the question i 'll answer yeah just to answer the question in relation to heat so my understanding is that the um the pem fuel cells uh will emit a low grade sort of 60 65 degrees celsius heat which would be available to the vessels that will improve the overall efficiencies of the fuel cell which is the efficiency of a fuel cell is sixty to forty percent any beginning a life to end of life so you improve it significantly if you can tap into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have that um that available to you as well showers for everyone that 's it so why um why put it on the roof for the for the retro fitting because you know getting that in on board okay we 're talking about retrofitting a existing vessel the most easy solution is to put on the roof and if you have a look you know half the air conditioners out there sitting on the roof anyway so yeah that 's how we see you know the first initial steps and then changing over existing vessels and getting them into into uh into fuel cells just in relation to the if you have an existing battery powered vessel fuel cells are a good addition in terms of just range extension so you can provide that additional range over and above what the battery can provide you thank you um when you were speaking earlier you uh you mentioned agave and uh electrolyzer uh and they 're functioning uh obviously they have a function in the fuel cell could you explain that for us the electrolyzer yeah sorry so electrolyzer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an electrolyzer is we have water as the sole input we apply renewable electricity by the electrolysis process and we split the water into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas the agave comes into it because they want to be an end user of hydrogen and the our renewable electric uh electricity but also uh ultimately they 'll have a lot of waste water which we 'll look to use as a circular economy so we 'll use that water to to split into hydrogen to create hydrogen yeah sort of yeah we are looking at using fuel cells on site so we 'll be looking at utilizing that low grade heat in the distillery if it makes sense so the electrolyzer sorry the electrolyzer is the core component that produces hydrogen gas yep from electricity it 's like a membrane or something like that yes correct yep yep or is it like an electrolyte no no it 's a it 's purely a membrane that 's correct yeah there are there are about four different types globally but we 'll be looking at the pem re-electrolyzer and just just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a little electricity to hydrogen okay so we need 50 kilowatt hours of electricity to produce one kilo of hydrogen okay and all we 're doing is just pumping electricity into water and when we do that it splits it it splits it into hydrogen and oxygen okay and we 're interested in the in the in the hydrogen but there 's also a lot of applications such as sewage treatment plants that are looking to have their own electrolyzer sell their hydrogen to us and other users they want the oxygen because what that does is they pump the oxygen into their waste water treatment plants and it increases their efficiency by you know many times over so it 's a win-win for everyone so the help chip can also be used for in the agri farm so your prawn farming and things like that to improve improve the farm sufficiencies i saw a youtube video the other week with jcb uh diggers in the uk and they 've developed an internal uh combustion hydrogen engine i just wondered if you could maybe flush that out for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done very well succeeded very well and i 've watched the same video look most oems at the moment are are or have already created their and converted um and are producing 100 hydrogen internal combustion engines that includes gas turbines as well so the caterpillars of the world and the likes yemen backers ge they 're all doing it so it is a thing um and that may be a stepping stone if you have an existing diesel caterpillar for instance as your main propulsion might be a stepping stone to either look to blend so talk to the oem look to blend hydrogen up to about 30 percent it actually improves the efficiency of the engine and reduces your emissions uh and then longer term and you 're looking to replace that asset you could you 'd be able to swap it out for uh equivalent 100 hydrogen internal combustion engine one of the one of the concerning numbers that we keep hearing in the media is this two dollars a kilo and i 'm sure you guys will be across that that 's just a fictitious number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy in a kilo of hydrogen um i mean what are we going to do about that because it seems to me that they 're setting up the industry is being not progressive if we don 't hit two dollars a kilo you know which would would place diesel you know diesel 's going to go close to two dollars a liter shortly so you know we 're just not comparing apples with apples and it just consistently keeps coming out so when it comes to a kilo of hydrogen versus a kilo of diesel hydrogen has five times the energy density okay and once we push it through an electric electrolyzer it 's a factor of four okay so that means that if you 're paying two dollar which i 'm paying right now two dollars a liter for diesel parity and meaning it 's the same price as diesel okay it 's going to be around that twenty ten dollar mark okay so ten dollar a liter a kilo of hydrogen so if if if aaron sells me 10 a kilo of hydrogen for for 10 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the same as me burning diesel okay now that 's going to drop okay so the first kind of uh costs or the purchase price is going to be somewhere between 10 and 16 dollars a kilo but it can it 's already been forecast that 's going to drop to around six dollars a kilo within the next 10 years and possibly even lower okay and if we start paying two dollars a kilo for hydrogen that 's 50 comparable to 50 cents a liter of diesel yeah they 're going to kill the industry if they 're not very careful it 's a fictitious number that keeps popping out in the press constantly and that was driven out of the us where it was two dollars u.s a kilo that was a target they 'd like to achieve in the next 10 years taylor and co keep grabbing that number and it 's as if they 're they 're wanting industry if it doesn 't get to that it 's not successful i think it 's really important that the five-time multiple energy uh which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not a good number to have out in the industry yeah we 'll we 'll prove that it is i might i 'll repeat this question to rachel online if you can hear me rachel um we 're just having a discussion are you there rachel you hear me yes i am here sorry yep no worries we 've just had um a question from the floor it sparked a little bit of discussion about the price of hydrogen being comparable at the moment to diesel but about the risk of that due to the embodied energy and hydrogen being much greater and it being a little bit um confusing in comparing the cost the real cost of hydrogen energy compared to diesel energy so do you have any do you understand the question do you have any comments around that yeah this is a good one because i think people people fixate on the two dollar the two dollar a kilo price of renewable hydrogen that was never so that was announced as a sort of stretch goal by the federal minister angus taylor i think earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or one of the federal government 's initiatives and i think it might have come out of actually the national hydrogen strategy way back in i think that came out in 2019 as well where professor allen finkel was talking about it a goal of 2 hydrogen renewable hydrogen would need to be at a cost about two dollars to be commercially viable now he was talking about two dollars from an export perspective when he was comparing renewable hydrogen with lng again export prices of lng which i think at the time around about 15 a kilo don 't quote me on that but it or maybe eight dollars to 15 a kilo depending on what the off take agreements were but my point is that that two dollars was had a very strong export focus for um potential customers who are currently our lng customers who are importing millions of tons of fuel whether it 's lng or in this case perceived renewable hydrogen now whether or not hydrogen will ever reach two dollars to australian dollars a kilo is a long and complicated journey um and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our export partners may put on fuel that has not has not been produced via renewable means it will not be transported via renewable means the conversations about cost are a long way off and it it 's actually not comparing apples and apples if you 're comparing it to the diesel that you 're putting in your your car now but where because again the industry is a lot it 's still a long way off um all these talk about electrolyzers there 's currently two electrolyzers in the whole state and they 're tiny they 're 170 kilowatts so we don 't have enough an operational electrolyzer anywhere near the scale you would need to to be producing even hundreds of tons of renewable hydrogen at the moment and we also don 't have the renewable energy capacity either yet so this is this is definitely an emerging industry and that two dollar price was part of part of that long term emerging industry scenario the big advantage and you can say this about electrification as well as hydrogen and this is we 're hearing more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because of the fact that evs electric vehicles and whether they 're battery evs or hydrogen fuel cell evs are using electricity that is just becoming so cheap to generate so p a lot of people who are buying evs and they 're probably not as popular for good reason up around um north queensland as they are in the cities and certainly overseas but minister de bretti has often talked about why wouldn 't i want an ev where i can fuel at home i literally just plug my car in and i know what price i 'm paying for electricity i 've got solar panels on the roof i 'm in charge of the fuel that i 'm putting in my car it 's so it 's really simple whereas at the moment in australia there 's two remaining oil refineries and we don 't produce any liquid petroleum in australia so we refine the product here but we import all our crude petrol and diesel it 's all imported so we 've got absolutely no control over the price we pay off that crude crude oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i think it 's bp you 're going to kanana and wa and we 've got ampol which is part of the caltex group here in queensland if they decide to shut those refineries we 're even more dependent upon international corporations and shipping for us to fuel our cars and i guess with the price of electric vehicles coming down people are sort of saying well actually it makes sense we 're never going to run out of we are never going to run out of electricity renewable electricity in australia was very very very very slim chance and i guess we 're just in that situation at the moment where the infrastructure we don 't we haven 't got the same level of ev charging capabilities that for example california has but we will get there and the queensland government is part of its zero um zero emissions strategy is looking at boosting the ev super highway and there is an eb super highway that goes all the way up to port douglas and there will be i 'm pretty sure there isn 't charging there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll be they 'll only be like two and they 're probably never used um so the infrastructure 's coming the cars are certainly coming evs are getting more and more popular every month so i guess i wouldn 't worry too much about the two dollar debate because even the price of hydrogen particularly renewable hydrogen is all about the price of energy so the cheaper renewable energy is the cheaper it will be to either fuel your car using straight electricity or the cheaper it will be to produce hydrogen and the hydrogen fuel cells are being looked at particularly for things like heavy vehicles and in the resources industry like sun metals i can cancel thanks rachel did you want to add anything yeah look thanks rachel i i tend to agree i think the initial two dollar uh from my understanding initial two dollars came from japan putting their hand up and saying we were two dollars is a target cost of hydrogen per kilogram i think the other confusing thing with the messaging from the government with the two dollar target is the that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means at the outlet of the electrolyzer so on top of that you have cost for compression and storage and then obviously transport and distribution so there are costs on top of that to deliver so it is a very i guess um confusing messaging i absolutely agree with that but um and the other thing actually i 've completely forgotten what i was going to say actually what we are hearing when it comes to pricing we 're talking to a lot of potential customers particularly in heavy vehicle transport logistics companies and what 's very important to them is the zero emission messaging so if they were to buy green hydrogen they actually don 't have too much of an issue to pay a small premium over and above what they 're paying for diesel at the moment and it gives us the power look you know aaron and i can have our own fuel agreement and we can say for the next 12 months i 'm going to pay this amount for my hydrogen it 's given the power back we 've never had that power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to to to local communities on how they purchase their energy but it just but it just might be aaron it 's going to be you know other suppliers you know it 's going to be a commodity that 's going to be competitive and it 's going to give us choice and that 's fantastic you know it 's giving local communities you know creating local jobs and giving us the power to purchase our fuel that we need and consume and it 's all happening right here okay so we 've got time for one last question i think councilman grundy has one there um just one question regarding fuel excises and how 's how the government gonna deal with this changing world of um revenues which i think we currently need about 11 billion dollars a year after outgoings and i 'd be interested to understand where we may go in that space in the future particularly if you 're doing contracts with each other and how it works in the taxing space you can guarantee they 're going to tax it okay and you know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it might be something that i don 't know rachel might speak further to like she 's not in the treasury but um but it 's it 's going it 's going to be taxed it 's it 's you know as we replace fossil fuels they 're going to want the money to come from where the excise on fossil fuels and move it to where it 's going so let 's just hope whatever taxes is paid on you know renewable fuels like hydrogen that that just goes towards more renewable energy you know and zero emissions technology so yeah i dare say if it can be taxed it will be taxed but uh hopefully it 's a green input into this question from the floor is from councillor grundy and it was around um there 's obviously a lot of income generated from taxes currently on fossil fuels etc and the question was what does it look like in the renewable resources energy space and how is that revenue going to be captured is there any plans for that at the state or federal level at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question and i think it 's one that governments at all levels are looking at um it 's not not so much i guess a tax that governments benefit from now as much as well royalties on what are natural resources so i guess with the fossil fuel industry we 've depended on digging stuff out of the ground and selling it it 's been a natural resource with renewable hydrogen it 's more it 's a manufactured product at the end of the day and it 's completely legitimate questions so how does how do the schools and roads get built um if we 're not getting if we 're not generating royalties from that so the federal government are looking very very closely at that and i think in my presentation i mentioned some of the commonwealth working groups that are going on with the states and the commonwealth um and i think economists are looking at a lot of models at the moment around shared infrastructure and who will own the pipelines who owns our ports will there be shipping charges all those sorts of really big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got any answers and it 's again a while off i don 't think we 're going to see change certainly from a revenue perspective in the next two two to five years things probably aren 't going to change a lot until we really hit that big commercial export scale but it 's certainly something governments are looking at thanks rachel all right we might end the little session so thank you rachel for your time today and thanks to to aaron and to frank if you could please uh don 't worry about that okay so while we 're just going to get set up for our final presentation now uh this gentleman unfortunately hasn 't been able to make it from norway however however there is good news we 've been able to pose some questions to him which we thought would be the kinds of questions that you would bring up in a panel uh q a such as this so there 'll be a brief introduction to the company um that this gentleman has uh has started in norway uh and now has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short bio shortly and then that will be followed by the q a sessions questions that we posed to him so our final presenter is leif stavistrand he was born in canada but grew up on in and by the ocean on a fairytale island in western norway from an early age boats were the main interest and his passion led him into a maritime career sailing the seven seas circumnavigating the globes numerous times including a role as sea captain of an 89 metre tanker at 32 years of age he holds formal qualifications in naval architecture and also holds an executive mba so following the birth of his first daughter in 2012 he moved onshore with norway 's largest oil supply base culminating with the role of c o o and his proudest moment was kick starting the green and lean bass initiative cutting large amounts of greenhouse gases directly and indirectly this successful project is still ongoing to this day in 2018 a new era began when leaf decided to combine all his passions and experience and concern for global warming to found his company evoy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptized by norway 's pm and later that year it made an unofficial world record with 55 knots in 2020 the first customers received their turnkey powerful electric propulsion systems in the boats of their choice and the voyage has only just begun and he is in it for the long haul so we 'll take you to the the introduction to the company now how are we going matt sounds anybody electric you were old you had a clear goal to disrupt the whole maritime industry like tesla didn 't cars eway was founded if you will norway the idea i 've been doing and me and my father 's imagination and dreams ever since the night in 2005 we did one of our whiskey workshops finally in 2018 we took the leap and set out to do something no one had done before us making boats go fast and long on pure electricity since then grown into a team about 30 people from all over the world the great diversity and competence in the team accelerates us towards the vision of making bullying irresistible and thereby making significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output electric systems for our boats typical boats between 20 to 50 feet and single level or maybe even triple insulations and it 's important to note that we don 't make the post themselves we really just make the technology or the system that you can put into any book so that means we can also do retrofits and we can do as well as new so it 's uh it 's a good place to be so to speak where we are right now we have for us it 's a dataset system so the system that we put together is um plug-and-play from our site so it means that we can hand it over to you and everything is there there 's no worry about buying this or that everything is there out of the box so you can just plug and play it into the board and in terms of what we have available we have what we call the hurricane and second generation now coming in second generation which means that it 's tightened up cleaned up really easy to install on the boats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a system that actually goes into our first boat that 's um and also our second build the first boat we did 55 knots with back in 2019 and the second boat is uh should i say significantly faster than that so we can we can pound out quite a bit of power through our systems uh secondly we also have our outpour ready um for the market next year now the first deliveries are for private customers in q1 and then we 'll move into gradually as we move on into a bit of a larger market um so that 's something that we really really look forward to so there 's a lot behind the scenes and under the hood or whichever you want to call it what 's going on uh so we right now we 're looking for putting into three different levels into place so we have the hurricane of course which is naturally then there is the storm on the gate and the storm is on our lab but it 's not out on the water yet and then of course we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now it 's the gear that we have in the output version and it 's still hurricane for the inboard so that 's the main product lines that we have and it 's 400 horsepower it 's uh 230 and 150 horsepower uh as we tweak and continue on this this might change uh in the future but that 's where we 're at today and it 's really uh exciting to work with so to speak so i think um the interest that we have from around the world is quite immense it 's really nice to see that this is something that gives a lot of interest and we try to follow up but it 's it 's not easy because we 're we 're just 30 people there so we 're doing our best to try to follow up as good as we can hurricane is there it 's the 400 horsepower sorry in the market um i assume when one was thinking about the upwards which of course we 're getting uh human humongous demands for so the core business of evoy is our electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're really good uh and it takes time to develop the mechanical solutions to go along with electrical um so we 'll see we 'll do a lot of testing during next year and based on that we 'll see when when the larger systems can be ready because we can 't use the same lower leg for larger systems as we use for the small one today and then we we hope that in 2023 you can bring something cool to the market that 's that 's cool so we have a rule of thumb which is useful for everyone i think so when you convert from gasoline or diesel towards electric you 're looking at a factor of three to four between the internal combustion engines to electric so that means if you have one liter per nautical mile today you can then look at about three to four kilowatts per hour per nautical mile some some nerdy effects there but it means that if you have a battery pack of uh 120 kilowatts which is quite standard for a lot of our boats um you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range and this depends on weight on the boats which is the hugest factor on on the range and of course the holes of the boat and all these things but that 's approximately where we are today um and then there 's lots of projects that do photos to air between the holes steps stuff like that that even increases that range even more but most boats are standard vehicle and that 's what we 're working towards that 's in plain old speed um in low speed you can go all day as an example from our current um boat we can do around 24 hours and three knots or around 12 hours and five knots so you can go quite far so if you 're worried about running out of fumes so to speak or running out of electricity it 's just a matter of just taking down the speed of the building and you can pretty much reach whatever your desire is uh within reason so uh for us now that i have two years of experience we 're not we 're not really worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's happened a lot on battery side the past 10 years the batteries are in general the the energy density has come down from around 200 hours per kilo to around 271 hours per kilo so on that side it hasn 't happened a lot as much as people maybe think so it 's incremental changes as we go along on the energy density has really changed in surprises and the way we pack the batteries and that 's been an enormous change the past 10 years um going forward i think we 'll see somewhat of the same on the energy density so perhaps an average around five percent a year something like that and also what we see with batteries that 's getting packed today is that they are increasingly better and easier to recycle um so the batteries that we have and the arrangements that we have in norway is that we do second life for batteries to work with partners so that goes to cabins or houses where you don 't have that extreme power output and after second life on top of that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners they say that they can recycle between 80 to 90 so it 's it 's pretty good for us of course we have very low volumes and the batteries for marine use are quite expensive um so the cost initial cost or the capital cost is uh higher than what you have for the gasoline or the diesel um but we see with a lot of our customers or most of our customers they are commercial users so they use their goals for fish farming tourists portland harbor police government a lot of those things and when they have everything from 500 to 1000 to 2000 run time hours per year um they typically have a pretty good roi so our customers today usually have less than five years some down to one year return on investment so it 's getting pretty good um for the private market it 's of course expensive and maybe not so many that use the boat for 50 to 100 hours per year would evaluate to go for electric quite yet but hey if you can afford a yacht or something like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually and as the volumes grow as the battery prices come down it will gradually open for for more and more people and um we already see some countries around the world that 's putting in place funding for boats we know it 's in amsterdam we know it 's no sorry in paris and oil has it we know that the us is actually looking at it and who knows maybe even australia could come along and help the industry along a little bit which of course would make it accelerate quite fast so we have a few customer goals in the market in addition to our role so as an example we can use one of the fish farmers that we 've delivered to so what they see they have eight meter sixty volt spilled and hdpe um and um the weight of the boat is a few hundred kilos heavier than the one that they would have with the diesel because they had the first generations of batteries uh with the second generation of batteries the weight would actually be the same as the diesel equivalent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20 nine o 'clock mile range with the new batteries you can add five to that and they use their boat between 500 and thousand hours per year and with that they cut with the norwegian grid footprint they cut around let 's see that should be between 40 to 60 tons co2 per year uh in order to average for a normal car is around two tons per year so they cut the equivalent of uh um so 15 to 20 to 30 cars per year so we think that 's pretty good when it comes to cost it 's highly dependent on the costs in the different countries so some have really high cost for gasoline diesel everyone thinks they have high but norway is really high uh and of course the energy prices so that that varies a lot actually in norway um uh because there 's close to no maintenance or there is not really any maintenance uh we recommend you change sarah cooling liquid every second year and that 's pretty much it and so all all together in normal we 're talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less maintainance or non-maintainance and then of course the usage of the energy so um yeah so it 's getting pretty good thanks for the great questions um it 's uh really um interesting to hear all of the um the thoughts and and uh what people are interested in also from australia we have tons of uh interest from from from there i hope that it won 't take too too long before we can also help australia other missions and have that fantastic feeling of just quite quiet it 's it 's just a different experiences the different world going on the water without the sound and like our first customer said uh earlier they said it 's just a it 's a different feeling you feel so much better and i think that 's what we really want to bring into the world and to the customers just getting that that same feeling that we have using these systems is just it 's already nice to be on the water but this is just a new level of experience so i hope that we can bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that experience yeah that was great thank you leif remotely he may be on youtube up in the early hours of the morning thank you so much for uh bringing your energy to the room we 've had some great questions it 's been great to showcase some of these some of this tech and also could you please put your hands together warm thank you to frank hobson and to aaron smith all the way

4800, Australia",4613,just want to protect Jesus okay so that 's probably not [Music] really exciting it 's included adjusting formalized process this so as as most of you know I have to finish this my next year by with our programs looking like and that concludes allowance for wet season this year normal website so it 's probably worse than normal wet season are there any questions on progress construction it 's when the school tourism operators work me and they didn 't know that polylepis IDs all through through the construction period we 've got tremendous numbers of I was looking at and following answer my contractors in like a fishbowl and they were going to take that site visually there 's multiple people online as much for yourselves this presentation might as well so we would be sharing this and uploading it as well too so everything we see we issued the video we issued to make sure that you give as much information you can make sure that we can say that we can say thanks and Esther said we are any other process explained to the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Anna legislation is like government so 2009 it is a very prescriptive process all the doors for that can you see me quote it is bureaucratic red tape you need to do it because as I said it is a carpet si it is that it is a two-step process so we 're going from and expressions of interest I 've seen cradle video and they seem to be the same which want to find out what the market is out there for out to your Z asset making sure everyone has a benefit of that including yourselves but that 's that 's just as make sure that we including everyone to make sure we 're not precluding anyone you 'll see there we will be able to specific portion so that means is if I 'm just I 'm looking at to operate the fuel facility I can just put in for the field circuit I 'm just looking for a cafe okay I don 't need that happen to everything so it 's easy term several proportions don 't think it 's this weird little terminus histamine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and what you want to do is so we can actually have sort of put people in those groups together what they look yeah then we assess what a criteria which occasionally so there is an assessment it is a non price based assessment which are also great as I said we 're now looking at the interest of what people are wanting to go forwards that 's more rare it 's almost I always use the clock if like a dating app we 've got to know about you tell me Pepe what do you want what are you looking forward to what 's what 's the things that you can add to the facility to make it a good thing and that 's what this is all there we 're not looking how dollars it 's pure looking at you and what your business opportunity putting forward shortlisted so we are if we get a hundred we 're gonna there 's a process for us to reduce that down time to another to make sure we get the rocket over and then that goes up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many elected members of the council ones and that is a public process as well as what means public star so so once we get to that point next step is a select invitation tenders that means is if you 're sure listed we 're going to invite you directly now you 'll be you wanted now we want dollars price information tell us what you will feel that sort of thing so we can start as Jeff said I wanna fit out of the office building on one port for officers what does that look like to me what 'll it be again advice for that office go on ahead on structured where that look silence it 's more than a day time information from them and assist and again public councils so you 'll see everything we do is public go to the council they 're the final decision-maker the three of us in the room and out of the room we 're going to actually make the decision we 've put forward recommendations to the council so as council officers that 's our role so this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day that 's where it comes from they criteria it 's more of a good it 's not about price it 's it 's it 's worried of its you normally you see in submissions and things it 's if one interest you surely make sure one sustainable stop we 're going to sign a ten-year lease we 're so I 'm going to make sure they 're going to pass either to fund that operator and keep it going I 've got at least with you for ten years and after one year involved that 's why we think for us from the council point immune from the NASA point yeah so that 's what that means I will say please please don 't concern yourself with information you 're putting all of this we have a strict confidentiality council the number of people who can actually access that information at all no one else out so we have a lock down that tender call all you put into there are two people who have access to unlock that and then from there we then have a fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four people we do whatever they can imagine if you if you don 't want to you want to put statements in there but I can avoid this if we go further than things fine but we are going to need to see it okay so please just under consume that that 's going to go in be put into the ether or things like that business plan model what 's your business playing pretty self-explanatory there is some more information we will see to explain his little bit more detail and a narrative at the end of the schedules you sue them to IV state AE back and tenure so what were wanting to what term you want to actually be in there for so that beginning that 's of interest was probably ten year to year one year you know Paul it seems it 's crank Prague is the operator of that facility he wants to know what the mix of tenants will be what coming but this is a commercial business what return is and lot of different things very useful what bits has that fit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their conflicting space contribution to the facility so again it 's again getting back to creates video I did watch it looking at to making it a success look it 's to make it it is well plus a certain I 'm sure you go a sit there look out and go well this looks awesome and everyone that 's goes into that facility looks and sees what it is and that 's what the intent of this process to these we 're going to make sure that whatever you do adds the values of facility make sure when people turn up it adds to the visitor experience previous all their experience have you done a call that you currently operating on that wall if that isn 't that means you know that 's pretty much in a lot of content I already made it was support local business favorites all those things that council myself so it is it is pretty self-explanatory but it is your opportunity to selling yourself but that 's why I can say it will make sure I don 't think less is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't think we now buried in this process the only things we can assess these waters written down that bit of paper if we know something about you know you 've got twenty years experience and doing what you 're doing but that 's not written down we can assess that is that you must be written it in sorry about that but that 's the way government so as I said for or questions clarifications through the LD 10 o 'clock portal and there is nothing called before if it is a specific question about yourself that is only your question will answer you directly with the general question looks we think that everyone should say will I answer every one that point in time no no Sam we will always use on the danger of things if there 's some changes or some more information you want to share with you which I was like there is gonna be some more informational to share with you go forth we 're not going to get a change or substantially just someone from Asia which my assistant but maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might want to share with useful opposing date-time very important that means is that website please that log but on 158 you were not like and you are like and I do not have to accept you so please give yourself plenty time I am that morning log on make sure everything 's working because that portal shut you will not be able to access it if you email that 's not acceptable you need to put a cool report this is an important thing technically if you have any issues regarding health alone it isn 't a simple quick upload all inside by Purdue issues technically please talk to us and we 'll help you through that because as I said we want to eat your solutions in which I 'm gonna triple OT as many as we can the best and as that is just that idea behind that is is if I put my submission in what to be in the front as I said it is lengthy but the reason of their yourselves and ourselves regarding here we 're dealing it isn 't as carbon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a best shot this world goodie questions about the process itself please asked me today II when we have to questions but it is clearly seen from there dude buff yourselves I might be huge and so we can clear up any gray it 's up to big sonic great thank you thanks Peter so I suppose personally I 'm sure you 're as excited about the potential is specifically as well yeah and that is one of the reasons why we want to add to expression of interest I want to clarify the reason for that automobile industry for 25 years is our defensive cruisers for eight years I saw shoot Harbor in the day with 1000 packs a month we know what it can be but in saying that were also not arrogant enough to go you know what we have everything so the expressive interest process was about casting that very wide in the hope that we actually come back with hollow ideas and thoughts that we 're together consider now we know that we expect there 's going to be marine operator there we know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that 's what facility actually has a DA for right now but what we 're saying is let 's cast my and see how we can actually bolt in a lot of complimentary businesses that will deliver a sustainable commercial facility remembering this is community right payer money so we 're not in the business of this facility in building a community asset by that I mean we 've got the PEC we 've got facilities in town movie and we provide it for community benefit this here is about your businesses succeeding at a world-class marine terminal so the the process of the EO I was about casting the net and seeing what comes out of that beyond that I should say to that the council with that in mind is looking to if need be an idea comes in consider actually changing or submitting a DA back council to allow for uses that are currently listed so to those that are on teams and those in the room if you have an idea that 's out of the box please don 't put it in we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit for the facility to actually provide the use of the facility so I can work so that that 's one thing what are our what 's our vision for shoe heart and am i tough some of these regards to have being a vibrant asset that the division the people that are successful with a world-class facility not operating out of a you know a half-built shared or not writing ever agenda the half works this is an investment and Trevor 's team through planning and building is going to provide an asset that you 'll be able to be proud your custer 's will get a great experience through and again you 'll have some tenure and this is an important thing because reviewing the documents today around the operators that you have you know there 's a feeling loose grievously there 's something about there are some that was a conversation so from from up the business point of view that really provides you with no surety or certainty so and it 's what we want to do is be able to come up with some really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gives certain and takes away the idea or the misunderstanding of what we thought what was sitting so that 's also the other part is to actually provide you guys with something that will add value to your business in the event that three years from now you want to sell them so there 's that side of as well so you know obviously we would expect there 's going to be marine operators the food and members I said there 's fuel facilities we 're also looking at ideas for example where we might use the portal language cruise ships which Honda they are the northwestern side of my body but I need you be aware that so it 's less than three more miles to shoot out so what we 're saying is maybe we actually have those tended throw and shoot however it becomes another option two cruisers bishops readable and just so you understand is we 've had conversations well back and five of them and ten people shoot harbors as as a cruise ship Anchorage so what we try to do is go okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods Sundays when it comes to a marina business I believe and then you talk about the islands and the destination is just off from shoot harbour and again I understand why that 's of interest to a lot of you here today because your businesses are essentially utilizing those islands close by I understand that it makes part of your your business mix so we know we understand that and we 're not here to to me now the process of peak discussed before it is the process that 's required and needs to be transparent and I can assure you on the other side of this process when you are successful you 'll actually have a document that will actually provide us with certainty around your operations so you know I think just keep going back to that because that ultimately is all the things were asking for is provide you would benefit on the other side of this just touching that because it was a business operator business myself without tenure over there and I saw the lease or agreement in the you are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a council changing so this is the very opportunity is to yourselves to actually get that bit of document that 's going to provide you know certainly going forward look beyond that oh I 'm actually I 'm going to take questions around around facility so any questions I mean is there anything that happens on the task on that is severely questions I should all say one other thing quickly and that is the financial requirements as in Peters evaluation list please know we 're all in covent together please know that we understood they were short shark attacks twice you 've got us to the identity used before that so when you 're doing your financials please understand we appreciate that it hasn 't been the best trading to them so so don 't panic if you if you 're putting forward your financials and they aren 't as solid as they might have been four years ago so we 're very aware of what 's occurred in region so please just as Pete said you information in there qualified as best you can it 's confidential that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can actually understand your your business and hopefully provide the outcome that you 're seeking so this there 's not much else I mean this again this once the Ohio might clarify this format but once the apay process is concluded it will be engaged with those it was successful now at that point is there opportunity for the or should still be a process we 're just putting myself here but there 's one one to stay inside once do i closes you 'll be notified and then you 'll be new direction on the house it 'll process focus but you might have questions when you put your submission in we might look at and say hey this is really good or we have some questions we were a hospital so that might be makes trying to be multi you 've said this position counsel also does in those rules have the opportunity to meet with you and actually say present us so if it 's an idea that we say this is really good all Chinese it 's different for example for Wickham and want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a very strong currently which means essentially a purely strict or barring will operate that means we have another party sitting in the women doing anything untoward but we can 't talk to you if it doesn 't once you put that information in each eventually type start talking it there so it 's all we go process the process the rules are very funny but we you mean we can actually check to your their written word sit down have a chat to you but what we don 't want is soy conversation where someone else can say someone 's getting a different advantage of someone else and that 's a lot I want to make sure everyone knows is that because another something to happen but it 's just that we don 't want that import that 's that 's so you came to talk to people after you submitted about the crisis then once we come to the tip process again that in part of it we can 't talk to you again I know it stop start but that 's the best way to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a whole and seeing the what you 're wanting to do is a strike see it 's we want to make sure you there in in in we 've got or I would be putting forward because if we 've got that right that means okay that 's exactly where the Mexico that excellently thank you yeah and that 's certainly commercially something so and the bush is supposed to go through to procurement in this period if they 're questions didn 't like to commercially marine moraine you know people come to myself and ask well I said to be answering but will be going back through the same as construction so it won 't be pigs team that are procuring to answering your questions in some cases you can specific to usage and all each of our roles within the development then will be providing the feedback through payment again it 's just making sure that there 's one line of communication so I going to pull back to insuring pro-v around the process just putting it as much information as you can and understanding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like in an application for a rental house just a little bit more formal it 's just making sure you 're getting tenure and then we 've got it right because a lot changes and you might think hey this is not change for me to do two different things just this what Craig said a bit too a bit financial but if you want to put Tunis where years worth to actually show trend very much so please do that 's a normal trainers disc this is what 's just occurred that that was just much more than eighteen because yeah very much understand something the reason I was now so that 's not going to go into the we 're gonna wipe questions now I will say we do may have questions to come in chrome team and it on the floor so what there is will go so thanks thanks any question like so with regards to the makeup of the square me Richie they 'll be bursts that can be allocated a touch and go so it 's going to be a mix depending on again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll do is there 's no fixed structure as yet what there is though is we have we know what the facility will look like we know what we have with regards to availability and then we will work with each person as that they come through the process to understand their needs so probably within your expressive interest you know the other things you might want to be sort of including around you know your particular needs and wants of the facility with you with regards to pricing we haven 't gone down to what it looks like because ultimately our business and revenue model needs to reflect cost expenditure so we 're very mindful of the costs around operating with marine vessels and the like you know we 're in the business to to provide you know complimentary and other facilities so you know we 're not the business of pricing people that 'll market but again we have no structure around what that looks like yet but I can assure you is a magnificent facility that will will make you guys proud to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what I would suggest is in your diversion of interest placing all the things you wish want and would like yeah um and then from that point of lingo criteria of five points so don 't don 't second guess in aquarium one new one yeah totally and that will help you at the other side because we all understand clearly what your business needs are so yeah and that 's what I mean if we don 't read it we can 't assess it so and whilst we might know some of your businesses we need to actually pull ourselves out of that and actually assess award criteria so now we understand it there 's a lot of work you need to do but all I would say is and this is me doing it the next step to ensuring you know you 're part of this facility going forward it 's when you send it out you can send it as a PDF so you can zoom in as much as you wish also what we are going to do is we 're actually going to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like in terms or in the room so you 'll actually have your own copy that you 'll be able to to drill down and understand put together it 's a bit of an idea or summary around what we 're thinking knowing full well that we aren 't Richards so when you read this broad strokes to give you an idea okay so I 'll take the picture and then you can Vulcan your great ideas or in your businesses into that what wanted a lot of Fulham oh yeah steam calling boys okay so have you got time so some ideas around yeah I should know now diesel I think 's around a hundred thousand litres and you LP lying about twenty thousand but all talking phone yeah we 'll come in hey hey just remembering what I believe actually put that in the document Anil in in the data itself I 'll double check to make sure sir so then if it 's not we 'll push that information there is one of those updates just to say what they tell us because I know that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tank story so again as you drive into the facility of the fuel facility will be on the left up against the cliff yeah high speed diesel on thinking forefinger on turn one and diesel and you won 't be on finger two and just one of those images in white so those people who are at you to facade on the building the camp oxide is recycled Timbers of the existing pontoons I do have up on the side offers three or four pieces that have been dressed and they look mainly listen so if you 're there basically just family all be personal or I can invite anyone from their teams don 't ask any questions I think we have any question from online watch so thank you very much for your time that is the end of today that we 're all Sheriff nation will like sensation the video so hopefully we 're not seen on the video we 're not as good-looking as Carrie I 'm sure you 'll come away I should have asked that please put the back to the information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the

Study,RV09Qa4XAYU,20210401,2798.64,"Proserpine QLD 4800, Australia",7347,thanks everyone for joining us today 's webinar is all about heat and heat management i 'm olivia broadhurst and i 'm the coordinator of the whitsunday climate change innovation hub the hub is an initiative of whitsunday regional council and looks to build resilience of the whit sundays and communities everywhere to climate change since the late 1800s human-induced climate change has warmed the earth 's average temperature by about 1 degree celsius and this is predicted to con continue to increase rapidly over the coming decades making heat one of the largest risks to be managed with our changing climate today 's webinar shares information on a study completed for the climate hub by mosaic insights and nce economics the study focused on heat in proserpine as an example of a typical regional queensland town we have two presenters today dr stephanie j jacobs is going to present details of the heat mapping and modeling completed in the first inner study first stephanie is a climate scientist specializing in urban climate and cooling climate change and heat stress she completed her phd research in modeling urban heat mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the current and future climate at mosaic insights steph conducts spatial urban heat modelling from the street scale up to the local government scale using a range of microclimate models to determine the best way to cool the urban environment stephanie will provide information on how heat is predicted to increase in prosopine the area 's most vulnerable to heat and explain the heat mitigation methods that were tested in the study we will then dive into the cost-benefit analysis with our second presenter dr bayani tommy bayani is an environmental economist with a phd in the non-market valuation of urban amenity benefits natural resources and open spaces such as waterways and urban open spaces since joining nce economics in 2017 bayani has undertaken a number of studies on the value of urban amenity enhancement across green spaces waterways and coastal zones bayani has worked extensively with dr stephanie jacobs integrating urban cooling and economic model estimates bayani 's presentation will pull together all the science and explain the most cost-effective ways for rural towns such as proserpine to manage heat into the future each presenter is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presentations we will have some time for questions we ask that everyone please keeps their microphone muted during the presentations you can also type questions in the chat if you are having trouble with your quality of your connection we would recommend that you turn off your video we are recording the webinar and as i said it is going to be available shortly on the whitsunday climate change innovation hub website so without further ado i 'm going to hand over to dr stephanie jacobs from mosaic insights to present the first steps of the study thanks steph thanks olivia i 'll just share the slides for you okay thank you everyone thanks for having us here today it 's really exciting to share the results of this really cool work we did for whitsendai regional council so looking at prospine and what the temperature is like in the current future climate and how we can try and improve it so this seminar will start with a little bit of doom and gloom regarding climate change it 's a pretty scary prospect but um that we will kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something we can do about it to really help so it just is a bit of context for this work you may not know this but heat waves are actually the deadliest natural disaster in australia so they 've actually caused more fatalities in the last 130 years since um uh compared like sorry they 've caused more fatalities in the last 130 years than all other natural disasters combined so if you think about uh floods bushfires tropical cyclones earthquakes heat waves have caused more deaths than all of them which is pretty alarming so they 're often described as silent killer because those who often suffer from heat waves are usually the most disadvantaged or young children and the elderly so another kind of scary prospect is that climate change is expected to make heat waves hotter longer and more frequent so research that was done found that by 2090 prosopine is expected to have 45 heat wave days per summer so you can see that in the map on the north that the number of heatwave days per summer in 2090 in a high emissions scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the longest heat wave event is also expected to be approximately 20 days which is quite an alarming time uh length of time in summer there 's also been research that 's found that by 2050 the number of days over 40 degrees celsius in prospine is expected to increase by 540 percent which is quite a lot um it 's about 0.6 days per year but the number of days over 35 degrees this is a very hot day is expected to increase by 205 nine days per year so some pretty scary uh statistics involved with climate change but it 's also worth considering that ninety percent of australia 's population also lives in urban areas whether these are you know the large capital cities or smaller towns and it 's these urban areas or that also suffer from something called the urban heat island effect so basically when you have things like roads buildings footpaths they 're these human-made surfaces that really are often darker than a natural environment and they absorb heat during the day and they can release it at night cities and urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and like cool the city but instead it 's underground less vegetation fewer trees then urban areas also just contain hot things like cars they emit heat air conditioners and even people they can all contribute to the urban heat island effect so when you consider that heat waves are particularly deadly and they 're likely to get worse with climate change combining that with the fact that most people live in a town or a city and they can suffer from the urban heat island effect it 's a pretty dangerous combination which led us to the first part of this project which was looking at what does urban heat look like in proserpine in the current and future climate so to do that we conducted some heat mapping and we used the target urban climate model which was developed by the crc for water sensitive cities so when you conduct heat mapping it 's kind of it 's quite simple in that you need spatial data for a site you need meteorological data you pop it into a model and you get some heat mapping so this slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sourced for prosepine so we used a company called geoscape and they have all of australian urban areas at a two metre resolution so you can see on the left is a google satellite image of prospine and surrounding areas and on the right is the data that we sourced from geoscape and that became the information that we put into the model so to give you a bit more of a detailed look at it we 've zoomed in on this area you can see proserpine i mean you can see main street up here and we 've got the sugar mill in the northeast of that northwest sorry of that image and you can see the breakdown of the different land use types that are involved in this data it can look at bare earth it can differentiate between buildings roads swimming pools and trees and so what we did was we took that information and we classified it in the into the spatial information that the model reads so that 's buildings roads concrete dry grass irrigated grass trees and water so we took this data and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data so what we did was we took data from proserpine airport weather station and we looked at the air temperature the relative humidity the wind speed the surface pressure and some radiation variables like solar radiation and what we did was we chose a day that is considered it 's not the hottest day that 's ever occurred in possibine but it 's still quite a warm one but the temperature was 37.5 degrees this is quite a hot day and so what this graph in the center shows is how the temperature rose throughout the day and also how the relative humidity changed and it actually decreased during the day as the temperature got hotter so that 's the information that we put into the model into the heat mapping model but we also wanted to know how is the temperature going to change in the future climate so what we did was we got climate model data from eight different climate models and aggregated them and looked at how that will change in proserpine we use the high emissions climate change scenario which is i suppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts but it 's also the the track that we 're currently on which is a bit of a scary prospect so we looked at temperature data and um other variables from the climate models for 2050 and 2090 as these times were the ones that aligned most uh best with the planning scheme so by 2050 it was expected that a february day would be about one and a half degrees warmer and by 2090 it would be about three degrees warmer so that was the information that we put into the heat mapping and so here are the results so what this shows is the uh map of prosecpine for the temperature on the left in 2018 so that 's the current climate we chose this 37.5 degree day and what 's interesting is that at prosopine airport it was 37.5 degrees but in the town it reached a maximum of 40 degrees and it 's interesting to notice that some of the hottest areas in the town were the sugar mill the hospital where lots of vulnerable people can be the catholic college the nursing home main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't that surprising when you think of these like asphalt surfaces that can be quite dark absorbing heat we also did this analysis for 2050 so in that situation the temperature at prospering airport would be 39 degrees but in the center of town it would be 41.5 and again it 's quite a lot warmer and and in 2090 the temperature at prosecpine airport would be about 40.7 degrees but in the center of town it would be 43 so it 's quite a big difference this urban heat island really affects it it 's also worth noting though that areas of irrigated grass and some of the sports fields and the golf course they 're quite a bit cooler than the you know more traditional urban areas like main street and also the areas around the river and some of the more natural areas are also quite a bit cooler so it 's really interesting that they can provide this great contrast and temperature could hopefully be harnessed to help cool prosperine so we 've kind of demonstrated that it 's going to get hot and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotter so which led us to the next question which was how do we reduce this urban heat and lucky for us there 's quite a few ways to do it this is where the presentation starts to get a bit more positive here 's what we can do about it so we actually looked at 11 different scenarios for how we can potentially reduce urban heat in proserpine so the first three were white roads white pavements and white grooves this is when you are painting that surface white and it 's quite a simple concept where basically if it 's colored white it reflects away the solar radiation and it means that if it 's a white road the road is not absorbing all that heat but there is a downside in that they can often produce glare because that radiation is bouncing off the surface and you know perhaps going into your eyes so that 's something worth considering next we looked at things that would be defined perhaps as green infrastructure so misting systems water fountains having a pond having some green walls and irrigation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes energy from the air to then be evaporated so that can create a cooling effect but some of the downsides of these ones is that they can be expensive to install or sometimes require a regular a regular water source and finally we looked at implementing street trees replacing a hard surface such as like a bird or some concrete with grass or replacing a hard surface with irrigated grasses and trees and so the idea of this is to reduce the amount of impervious surfaces that are there and try and increase shading through trees but it is worth noting that sometimes there can be some engineering conflicts and we know that street trees are not always that easy to implement when considering driveway crossovers and potential densification limits so what we decided to do was we ran a really detailed high resolution modeling study on a case study area that was bounded by chapman street main street davey avenue and marathon street and we looked at some high resolution 3d modelling of that site and what we did is we then implemented different scenarios involving these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads and then we looked at what the cooling effect would be so one of the benefits of conducting this high resolution modeling is that modeling is a great way to try before you buy with cooling options you can see what works best you can see what maybe doesn 't work that well in proserpine but you can also see what might have some unintended consequences so this case study area we chose we looked at it because it contained main street which as the initial study showed where we mapped the temperature it 's one of the hottest places in the town it 's also quite an urban area it features car parks but we also have this green space as the sports fields located in the school so i 'm not going to talk you through the results of every single experiment we did but i 'll talk you through some of the more interesting results so the first one we did was street trees so we placed street trees on both sides of the road on the east-west oriented streets and just on the eastern side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because on the east-west streets sun is overhead throughout the day but on a north-south oriented street we want to protect the buildings and shade them from the afternoon sun so the trees that we simulated were six meters high and had a width of about five meters and they were generally placed about five meters apart so what this map on the right is showing you is the cooling effect so we modeled the temperature of that zone when we had um when we we didn 't have the trees just as it is currently and then we added in the trees and we looked at the temperature difference and you can see that it was pretty stark there 's quite a big cooling effect where these trees were and the maximum cooling actually exceeded four and a half degrees so it really felt a lot cooler under those trees this is because you 've got shading from the trees and evapotranspiration where the trees you know transpire water it 's also worth noting though that a taller and wider trees would actually increase the cooling effect as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also produce more cooling because they are healthier and have you know thicker crowns and canopies but the reason we chose trees of these sizes because that 's generally what is preferred considering cyclone risk another interesting scenario we looked at was irrigated grass so in the scenario we irrigated all the grass at the kind of church and school block and we irrigated at 10 millimeters per hour from 2am to 5am and what 's interesting is that it had a maximum cooling effect of nearly 1.3 degrees which is pretty great and what 's also interesting is that the cooling effect actually extended beyond the area of irrigation so it traveled on the wind which i think is really exciting and could demonstrate that um these cooling effects can often spread beyond just where they 've been applied particularly if it 's like a windy day research was also done and that found that on days when the temperature is greater than 35 degrees in prosopine the wind is pretty much always from the north so it 's worth considering placing the cooling mechanism or cooling option whichever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this is one of those ones this is white roads we looked at so we painted all the asphalt roads white in the model where they reflected 70 of the solar radiation where a standard road would reflect only 20 so we 've really upped the uh whiteness and reflectivity of this road and what we 've done um is we then looked at the difference in temperature and we found that the maximum cooling effect is pretty strong it 's about 1.6 degrees and it was really applied quite widespread where we painted the roads white but also it traveled a little bit cooling a little bit further south of the roads as well moving into these areas but this is one of those ones that also had some of the unintended consequences so when we considered a measure of human thermal comfort so like it feels like temperature we measured something called the utci or the universal thermal climate index that takes into account things like temperature humidity wind speed and radiation and so what we found was that when you painted the roads white they actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused glare and resulted in the a lot of the areas of the case study actually feeling hotter once you 've painted the roads white which was quite an interesting finding and really demonstrated some of these unforeseen consequences that could happen so the final scenario i was talking i 'm going to talk you through was changing a hard surface to irrigated grass and trees so what we did was we converted an asphalt road to be replaced with irrigated grass and lined the street with trees so again the trees were six metres high and five meters wide with the trees placed again approximately five meters apart now in this scenario um we 've used main street as an example but that does not mean we 're suggesting to do this to main street it was just an example to use in our case study area and the results were pretty significant so again we found maximum cooling of about 4.8 degrees under those trees and it 's really um helped by having that irrigated grass underneath creating a nice widespread cooling effect and it really demonstrates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through increasing your vegetation so now i 'm going to pass on to bianni who will give us a bit of a talk through some of the economics involved with this work thank you steve for that excellent overview of the project uh all the um sophisticated um hip mapping it was really great to see you work through that um i 'll now walk you through the economic side of the project it 's generally helpful to communicate benefits and values in dollar terms and i 've been to conferences where i 've had people mentioning that um if you can 't measure it then you can 't manage it so let 's take this you know as a way to be able to measure the outcomes or the impacts that might come from some of these scenarios that steph has gone through and the other thing is that the dollar values this you know is essentially the language that is used by decision makers who are often you know faced with limited budgets but have many competing needs for those are limited funds it is important though that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematic robust and transparent and in this case we have adopted two evaluation frameworks uh the first one is called uh cost effectiveness analysis this is whereby projects are compared based on their relative performance in achieving a specified outcome relative to the cost for example in this case we are looking at cooling outcomes measured in degrees celsius the other approach is the benefit cost analysis of bca this is the primary economic assessment tool used to inform business cases for public expenditure and to help make policy decisions we use it to analyze the benefits and costs of a project or a policy initiative the measures or investment criteria in a bca or benefit cost analysis are the benefit cost ratio and the net present value a benefit cost ratio of greater than one implies that for a dollar you invest on the project you 'll get more than a dollar in terms of benefits and a net present value of greater than zero implies that um your overall costs are less than the benefits that you have included in your analysis these two measures can then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can also use them to rank and prioritize investments for the different uh projects for our bca we have followed the queensland treasury guidelines which are summarizing the flowchart on the right there we started by getting a good understanding of what the problem was and establishing a base case which is whereby we say what will happen if you don 't do anything differently or you do nothing more uh to in this case to mitigate the heat effects we then scope for our benefits for the different scenarios that staff has gone through and we consulted with the council and other engineers within a group of companies to get some information around the costs of those different options we then set up a benefit cost analysis model and calculated our npv or net present value and the benefit cost ratios which i 'll cover in subsequent slides can you move to the next one steph please okay um in this slide we are presenting our cost effectiveness analysis results this is a comparison like i said a comparison of the project costs to the cooling outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utci or universal thermal climate index for ease of communication the cea was undertaken by comparing the cooling outcome that can that can be achieved by investing a hundred thousand dollars so for every hundred thousand dollars you spend the bar charts here indicate how much cooling you 'll get under the different uh scenarios some scenarios appear blank uh this is because uh they were found to have no cooling uh impacts this is these are the adverse impacts they 've mentioned and um in other cases the cooling outcome was relatively very very small compared to the costs e.g um your white roofs uh this year this results indicate that irrigation is the most cost effective approach for achieving reductions in temperature and changing your heart surfaces to trees or changing those heart surfaces to irrigated grass is ranked second followed by street trees and grass areas next one please okay we 've just gone through the cost effectiveness analysis results now we 'll focus our discussion on the benefit cost analysis process this process or this approach allows us to look beyond just the cooling outcomes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most if not all of these scenarios in these scenarios will have some core benefits and these core benefits are the additional benefits to the targeted lower temperature outcomes for example putting trees in the landscape improves the natural habitat in the area which then enhances biodiversity outcomes we know that trees are also good at reducing carbon pollution and other studies have shown that reducing summer temperatures has some economic impacts through you know uh reductions in energy costs uh avoiding some productivity losses and also just getting rid of impervious surfaces can lead to improvements in stormwater management costs and we also know that you know creating comfortable vegetated and crust open spaces can stimulate people 's engagement with physical activities through recreation or exercise and over the long time this could lead to material health outcomes and thus avoided healthcare costs to the economy however while we 've got all these benefits it is not always possible to put dollar values against each of the ones that you have identified uh this is because sometimes there is just not enough data to estimate the benefit in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be transferred from previous studies or other locations to your study area and it could be that there 's just too much uncertainty around the benefit such that an attempt to assign a dollar value to that benefit could deduct value rather than add value to your um your whole assessment process in this case the benefits that we have assigned dollar values to these four of them and these are human uh comfort associated with cooler summer temperatures uh carbon dioxide pollution mitigation through carbon sequestration which is a function of uh the trees that are proposed to be put on the ground and we also have two livability benefits which are improvements in neighborhood amenity and enhanced recreation opportunities okay um i 'll dive a little bit deeper onto those um benefits that i 've said we have uh quantified uh the first one which is the uh following the human comfort benefit this was based on a research done in melbourne and sydney to estimate community willingness to pay for cooler summer day we adapted the findings from this study which was done by brent and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the prosecute region we then used the model reductions in utci from from staff for each of the scenarios and we adjusted the values from this sydney study to the prosecpine area taking into account inflation since 2016 when this study was done uh and also looking at the differences in household incomes because they that will affect people 's willingness to pay um it is also worth noting that this brand study that we uh relied on for this benefit is uh part of the research outputs from the crc water sensitive cities where the heat modeling uh was also done okay the then we have the co2 pollution reduction this benefit was based on estimated value of carbon abatement from a report by the act climate change action council we adopted a social cost of carbon which was around 70 dollars per ton we then used our indicative and conservative estimate to reflect the amount of co2 that h3 could capture and that information was based on another report from canberra from the department of climate uh of the department of environment climate change and energy uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was uh the enhanced amenity uh we know that vegetation contributes to improved neighborhood amenity which can have a positive impact on nearby property values so for the three scenarios we captured this benefit using a percentage impact on nearby properties and for this case study we had 33 properties that we judge as potential beneficiaries this low number of properties reflects the fact that our case study area is dominated by the town center which has quite a bit of non-residential development and we use that three percent value for measuring this benefit based on published studies the second livability improvement benefit was to do with recreation the irrigation scenario changing of hard surfaces to grass and changing heart surfaces to grass and trees i expected to provide additional space and opportunity for locals to recreate this is an important benefit that is however very difficult to measure for a case study area compared to the other benefits it had uh relatively large amounts of ions at ngs for example how many people would use the space where will such people be coming from how often would they use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still engage in recreation at another outdoor public space site because all that uh affects uh how you then go and say okay by having these scenarios on the ground this is the additional benefit so rather than making up all these assumptions we instead worked out how much recreation value is required to get a benefit cost ratio of one for the relevant scenarios uh next one steph so um in this slide we can see that green walls are the most expensive option followed by white pavement and car parks this costs estimated over a 30 year period which is a standard appraisal period if you are doing a benefit cost analysis following the queensland treasury guidelines and we discounted our dollar values using um today using seven percent a seven percent discount just bring them to today 's dollar value terms and the value of cooler temperature was estimated for all scenarios except where there was an overall increase in temperature like the white roads or the cooling outcome was generally very small compared to the cost eg or green walls and mistings has zero degrees celsius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrigation have a net present value of greater than zero this indicates that the costs and benefits that we accounted for in the model um because uh the costs are lower than the benefits accounted for in this model uh so overall these two scenarios are performing better than others the irrigation benefit we captured is the cooler temperatures the amenity improvements and carbon pollution mitigation outcomes next one please okay now in this slide we are presenting the benefit cost ratio uh which is a comparison of okay how much are you putting in as an investment and how much are you getting out as a benefit and we are also presenting a range for this benefit cost ratio value the range is useful for testing whether the viability of any of these scenarios is influenced by the uncertainty that we have built into our modeling uh like i said earlier there is lots of assumptions that we have to go through to come up with some of these numbers so what we would typically do we 'll say okay this is your most likely uh value for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this much and the highest you could possibly achieve is that this much and then we run the model through what 's known as a monte carlo simulation to just work out if uh maybe for example for those that are not viable if you uh mix and match the different combinations does that actually change the outcome does that tend that scenario uh from not viable to viable okay in this case uh our sensitivity analysis uh indicates that um it does not really change the outcomes the results indicate that street trees and irrigation of grass areas are the best scenarios in terms of economic outcomes uh at the bottom of the table we see that recreation from new grassed areas and irrigated grass entry areas are also potentially viable but this last two benefit cost ratio results are dependent on whether uh there 's enough additional visitations or people who will recreate at the site to offset the costs uh that 's it on the uh benefit or the economic side of things um steph i will let you then jump on to the next slide on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought i 'd run you through some of the recommendations that came out of our analysis so generally trees were pretty much the winner i suppose they created um they were really good cooling results they were very cost effective solution so when considering planting additional trees in proserpine it 's worth considering east-west oriented streets as a higher priority than north south streets purely because they receive overhead sun throughout the day but also as we know trees take a little while to get to maturity so it 's worth considering other cooling options while the trees are growing in terms of irrigation it was definitely the most cost effective solution and it produced some good cooling results we would recommend that perhaps irrigation for cooling is triggered when the air temperature is expected to exceed 35 degrees you could you know do irrigation the night before to try and help cool down the day next water fountains and misters we didn 't talk through those results in this project but basically they were really effective as a localized cooling but once you moved more than a couple meters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountain or the mister the cooling effect kind of dissipated quite quickly but when you were close to them cooling was about one degree so it 's worth considering something like water fountains and misters perhaps for localized kind of spot cooling maybe you have a busy thoroughfare and if you place them to the north of the hot spots they 'll be able to create a nice cooling effect where they 're needed the most in terms of the built environment it was a bit of a mixed bag so as we saw painting surfaces white does reduce the temperature but it can increase glare issues so it 's likely that the best results will come when you 're combining a white surface with something like a tree so you 're having this lighter surface it 's not absorbing as much solar radiation but you 're also having some trees to offer some shading from the glare also changing a hard surface to a natural irrigated grass or trees is quite a cost-effective solution as well and i think just generally we 've spoken a lot about you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of proserpine are up to three degrees cooler than urban environments so it 's also also worth just considering maintaining and expanding these natural areas as they 're also equally important for cooling so that 's it from us thank you steph and bayani that was a really interesting presentation and i hope that everyone has gained some useful insights from that presentation and extended their understanding of how heat can be managed into the future i personally found it very interesting considering that potentially we may be using irrigation as a tool for managing heat into the future and we at council are now going to be looking at all of these results and looking at how we can use this information across our region and through our projects to try and manage heat throughout our communities um so i just wanted to throw um the floor open now if anybody wants to ask any questions um you can jump in now we 've got a question on the chat tim did you want to ask the first question and i 'll read the chat yeah sure um thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just had a question around um i know you looked at green walls um did that also include like um green roofs as well i know this part of the world we haven 't got a very good uptake with um with green roofs to date so i just wondered on how that was considered or um potentially to look at in the future as well yeah so we only looked at green walls we didn 't do green roofs in this situation um that was something that came from council i think um but yeah it was they were an interesting thing and and the results uh didn 't show a great cooling effect um if there was a slight cooling effect it didn 't really travel very far from the wall and that is consistent with some of the literature out there so in terms of there 's definitely benefits but whether the cooling benefits probably not their number one benefit i think it 's worth noting as well that this study was obviously done on the town scale so the effect of of cooling the town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn 't a cost viable solution for us to you know to look at trying to encourage residents to all paint their roofs white for the cooling of the town however it may potentially be something that 's viable for the individual householder because there 's been a lot of evidence to show that you can get sometimes i think the studies are saying 20 to 30 reduction um in temperature within the individual home by painting your roof white so i think those kind of that kind of work may need to be done on a household level to really quantify the benefits of things like green roofs and white roofs on the individual household and i know townsville council 's done a lot of work on white roofs so yeah we may be able to get some information at the household level from that i 've got a question in the chat from vivian luxton she 's asking for some examples of irrigation what would it look like and how would it operate so um i know steph mentioned what she 's modeled did you want to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i can explain what we 're trying what we 're looking at yeah that 'd be good it 's the model was quite a simple kind of um you just splash water on the grass in the model but yeah olivia if you could go into detail that 'd be great yeah sure so um vivian just to respond to you a little bit we 're looking at getting some smart sensors so we 'd be able to look at what the weather forecast is obviously we don 't want to water in the water morning if it 's going to be raining in the afternoon anyway but if it hasn 't been raining and the soil moisture is low and we 've got a hot day forecast with no rain we would be looking at trying to trigger some irrigation that morning so maybe from you know 2 a.m to 5 a.m um we 'd be triggering in certain areas that we 've got the most vulnerable um that are the most vulnerable to heat and we have high traffic so areas around the walkways around the hospital the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at heat at 3 pm so if we 're trying to get those results at 3 o 'clock when the kids are leaving school then we 'll be watering and irrigating in the morning so it 'll be more of trying to irrigate those areas um to get that evaporative effect in that afternoon happening so we 're looking at trying to work out um how we may kind of get that infrastructure ready now to use it more as a irrigation as a tool i hope that answered your question did anyone else have any questions um i just have one if if we 've got time um i suppose there was a lot of discussion around uh heat studies and and what we can do now for for current houses but i suppose long term you know having developers start to build is there an avenue for getting some of this built into those design standards or i suppose next steps you know looking at not just patching up what we 've got currently but you know future planning wise so there was some recommendations that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be putting forward to council as far as things that they can look at incorporating into the planning scheme um and there 'll also be been discussions around could there be some kind of climate ready standards for future development so it may not be something that 's mandatory at start it may be a voluntary program um it could be a climate hub approved development program who knows but we have been discussing that about how we get that advice out and how we can almost reward developers for doing that those taking those actions and to turn and ensure that we are creating those cooler communities moving forward so yeah we 're definitely looking at different ways to do that so any other questions all right well we just i also wanted to acknowledge while we 're on on the line um don blackman from mosaic insights mitch perry and jim binney from nc economics because they also all contributed to this study so thank you to everybody it 's been really um great working with everybody and the

AUS,QLD,Whitsunday Regional Council,Whitsunday Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp2KXCWMXIgmDYxRg4lVpxg,WCCIH _ Webinar – Ann Gibbons and Kate McKenzie _ Risk Transparency with the City of Marion,2SiaDKiiiTM,20210106,2622.16,"Proserpine QLD 4800, Australia",7094,and what i recommend is that we just kick it off and and go for it because punctuality is important here we go hello and welcome everybody to the climate change innovation lab uh my name is ian morrison i 'm the climate change innovation lab manager for those that haven 't joined us before um today we 've got a webinar on about risk transparency with the city of marion and it will be delivered by by ann gibbons and kate mckenzie now uh risk transparency is one of those issues that from a climate change innovation lab perspective we 've been talking a lot about uh on a fortnightly basis for the past six months and it 's one of those issues that we keep on coming back to from a legal perspective from a financial perspective from um just an organizational management and community engagement aspect all of these aspects of um about the complexities of councils sharing and disclosing their risks and some of the the good things that it does some of the challenges that it presents all of that and it 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we don 't think about um that something comes out about the the importance of disclosing risk last week it was talking about asic updating their their advice about about how to disclose risk a few months ago we were talking about it with um the importance of makai regional council up front north in queensland um a fortnight ago we were talking about it with human council um down down in tasmania so it 's a very very pertinent topic and i 'm excited personally about about this webinar because um a few months ago uh donovan burton who 's one of the the lab directors uh gave me a call and he said ian a council in south australia that i 've been working with is doing amazing things when it comes to disclosing their climate change risks and we really need to be able to get that word out to others so i 'm really impressed and happy um that anne and kate have come together and and will be talking about this just a little bit of background about ann and kate so ann has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than 20 years including the last 14 years of the city of maryland during this time she has held a number of roles including coordination of the delivery of the climate change programs and seven metropolitan adelaide councils kate has worked with local government for nearly 20 years leading various risk in governance teams she 's currently the manager corporate governance at the city of marion with responsibility for elected members support systems of governance risk whs and internal audit so both um it 's one of those really good opportunities where we 've got uh two two members of council doing doing the presentation so without further ado i might just hand it off uh to ann and kate and they can take it from here take it away [Music] thanks ian um i 'm going to just in terms of a structure for our presentation today i 'm going to start by describing a little bit about where marion sits within metropolitan adelaide and our approach to climate change adaptation today and then i 'll hand over to kate who will talk in more detail about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not familiar with adelaide the city of marion is a i guess a mid-sized metropolitan council located about 10 kilometers southwest of the adelaide cbd um around 56 square kilometers we 've got the glenelg tram line to the north field river to the south around 7.2 kilometers of coastline adelaide 's known for its sandy beaches but we 've got the rocky cliffs and caves fish bit not much um stand on halleck cove beach at the moment and we 're home to around 92 000 people so um yeah so it 's one of those i guess yeah midsize as i said metropolitan councils in adelaide for quite a while now we 've been working um with our adjacent councils in southern adelaide to develop our response to climate change adaptation um the south australian government a number of years ago developed a framework for climate adaptation that we 've all been following here in south australia and in fact all of the 11 local regions in south australia have developed a response to climate adaptation um in resilient south we 're working with our partners the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of oncopranga and our project is called resilient south and we 've really been focused on having a region as it says it is resilient to natural hazards associated with climate change and and also capturing those opportunities in innovation to adapt to climate change impacts we commenced our partnership on resilient south in around 2011 when a grant opportunity through the natural disaster resilience grant scheme became available and we applied for funding um to support our initial um our initial oh well reload sorry i 've just lost the connection um hello we can still hear you you 're good to go okay i 've just completely lost the screen so i 'm going to have to i can 't move the slide because i 've lost the screen sorry how about that um [Music] oh no i can 't see a thing i 'm sorry that 's okay i 'll just keep talking um so our approach to um climate change in southern adelaide and through brazilian south was really not just about what the councils were doing but um engagement beyond um the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sectoral approach looked at economy and infrastructure and engaged engaging with business associations through our region and different different sectors in there we looked at our environment and natural resources so we look we engage with schools and community groups friends of parks groups etc to really cover off on the different elements and different sectors in our region that might be needing to respond to climate change um the next slide can you progress them ian hello yeah progressing them for you i 'm now on slide four about resilient south did you get yourself a regional adaptation plan yes that 's correct okay great thank you very much um so as part of that initial project that we got funding from the natural disaster of limits grant scheme we engaged across our communities to develop a regional adaptation plan within that plan to cover up on our sectoral approach we developed ten adaptation pathways with a range of different adaptation actions that would help us as a region respond to climate change impacts from there the four councils developed a southern region local government implementation plan which plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be doing within their remit to respond to those regional priorities identified in the adaptation plan and then each of the four local councils responded in their own way and relevant to their particular council areas so at marion we developed a climate change policy the other three councils in the region developed more targeted local action plans for their council area if you want to find out more about those plans i 've listed the resilient south website on the slide there everyone 's welcome to go in and have a look and explore that a little bit more to find out what we 're doing in southern adelaide as you 'll notice those two plans are coming to the end of their life so that 2019 was the end end year for those plans and what we 've been increasingly seeing from a range of different sectors like finance insurance etc is that um there 's an increasing awareness about the impacts of climate um on a range of things such as um insurance banks are starting to take notice um so we sort of thought as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a different way so in um towards the end of last year we held a workshop and we partnered up with six other councils in the resilient hills and coast region so ten local councils came together to have a workshop around under better understanding what the financial risks in particular and insurance risks were around climate change for local governments we had a briefing with executive and then a third staff workshop and that really began our journey into how we really embed our climate change risks into the way that we do things on the back of that workshop we then engaged donovan burton from climate planning and mark stevenship from seed consulting here in adelaide to deliver the climate risk and governance assessment for the city of marion we were one of four councils in south australia to partner on this approach the others being the city of adelaide city um sorry mount barca district council and adelaide hills council um and then we went through that process we had about 120 staff respond to an online email which was a great result and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior leadership team participated in face-to-face interviews with the consultants to better understand how we were understanding what our roles and responsibilities were in terms of responding to climate change risk so if you go to the next slide that i 've got there which is um the overview of council climate change adaptation governance and you 'll see that we did as i said before do quite well um i think um the thing that stood out i guess for all of the south australian councils that went through this process was that our regional approach and the way that we share information and collaborate in south australia has is in good stead in terms of responding to climate change risks um as marion i think the the thing that was unique for us was our approach to um corporate governance um we i think we 're one of the few councils across australia that um publicly disclose their corporate risks um which i 'm kind of surprised about because i thought maybe that 's how everyone did things so what i 'll do now though is i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about how we manage risks at marion great thanks very much anne so my first slide is the one that 's titled marion 's risk governance approach and what i 've highlighted on this slide is just the framework in regards to how we actually undertake our reporting um so you can see here that at the top of our structure we have the council and the finance and audit committee so we report currently quarterly to our council in regards to any risk that is sitting as a high risk within our risk registers um we also use our finance and audit committee which are a subset or a committee of the council itself we report to them in a little bit more detail annually just in regards to how the risks have changed over the last 12 months but still really focusing on those those high risks rather than everything that 's sitting within our risk registers in preparation i guess for these reports that go up a little bit higher uh we have a working group which is made up of our executive team um our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers um what we do at this meeting is that we actually look at our risks i guess more broadly we see i guess what 's happening across the sector might be an emerging or upcoming risk and really use these opportunities um i guess as a leadership group to really thrash out what 's happening and whether we need to have a further in-depth look at any of our risks or whether any of the risk ratings need to change uh it just gives that executive oversight and then supporting this what we have is our bridge register so managers are expected to review their risk manage there is registered quarterly and also we track uh due actions uh which are attached directly to risks um through this mechanism however i guess what our expected expectations are is that uh these are fluent documents and that as risks change you know managers aren 't expected to wait for their quarterly review they 're expected to update them um as we go through the process i guess one of the reasons of why we 've implemented this structure and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local government authority we have an expectation to be open and transparent to our community um and so that 's why we have gone down this path of i guess reporting through the council in an open environment the next slide which has just got some details here about our finance and audit committee so it is an advisory committee to council it doesn 't have a any decision-making authority on its own it 's made up the one of the reasons why it works well is that it 's made up of majority of independent members so we have three independent members and an independent chair and then we have two council members that 's it as part of this committee the independent members are remunerated per meeting and generally the the committee does meet about five times a year and part of those meeting schedules is that we also do have a joint session with full council as well so the reason why we do that is it gives the council the opportunity to i guess have that face-to-face conversation with the audit committee and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might find relevant based on um the the gamba of what their terms of reference are which is obviously not just risk it 's got the finance and audit side of it as well um we do have a variety of skills on the committee so our teams of reference actually require the independent members to have finance risk audit legal and compliance they 're not all required to have those skills however it 's expected that there 'd be those skills across the three independent members and i guess we 've had our audit committee in place now since 2006 so it certainly i think has matured and grown over that period and as we were going we weren 't always reporting through council on our high risks and so i think what as we matured in our approach the audit committee actually made the recommendation that council should be receiving quarterly reports on all of its current high risks and so after that recommendation from the committee that was obviously where we implemented it so on the next slide i 've provided an example of uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this report was presented to council in august this year so it 's fairly recent and i 've just circled in there of where the climate change risks have been identified so we don 't necessarily describe the risk in full detail but however we disclose obviously what the risk is what the uh the current risk rating is what the forecast is and then obviously what the inherent risk is as well um and so we use this uh i guess for all of our high risks and we use it as a very simple one-pager council can see it they can see where they need to focus or if they 've got any area concerns and it helps them i guess focus uh their questioning in regards to where we might need to be putting resources across the council over on the next slide um i 've just provided a extract from our corporate risk register so this does have a little bit more detail and this is but however we don 't provide this necessarily to council or necessarily the audit committee either it 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internally but it just demonstrates i guess the detail and how we work through that as an organisation um the next slide i 've got has been our challenges and i guess uh the key things of what i really wanted to identify here is that the risk management across the organization is still maturing and i think we 're still on this part where uh we have different parts of the organizations will apply to risk management in different ways one of the things that we 're really trying to do at the moment is find some consistency and ensure that relevant business units are using our risk management tools frameworks and principles in the same manner one of the other things that we 've had some challenges has been obvious with risk ownership and accountability and this is really about when uh actions are allocated to help reduce risk across the organization that they 're actually close at in a timely manner and that people are actually taking them seriously one of the strategies that we 've actually used in regards to this has been to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an executive or senior level and that we 've been able to have i guess an executive champion to really push risk through so this is where we 've been quite successful with the climate change risk um another one of our risks which is whs has been another one where the executive have really championed and led it from um from the top which has helped us in regards to actually getting what we need from a recalls perspective and also in regards to making some traction and help to to mitigate those risks um some of us the bottom two items they 're still current issues for us um the systems but you have how we undertake our risk management and the connection back to the i guess the strategy and the business planning of the business um sometimes there 's still is a little bit of a disconnect between what we 're trying to do in a risk management space and how how people can actually see that it is directly connected back to people 's business planning and a strategy for the organisation so we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system side at the moment to help streamline that the other one is obviously the training and the education for our staff and how we treat and manage risks across the organisation one of the things is that there 's always competing priorities um in regards to training and we often get the feedback that staff feel like there 's different training on different things all of the time and so it 's at the moment we 're in that phase of where we can actually pitch the training to make sure that we continue to grow our staff 's expertise and skills we really want our risk management practices to be across the organisation and our risk management team not to be seen as the ones with all the skills in this space as it really is a responsibility for all of the staff and particularly the leadership team as well and not just those staff that obviously sit within our risk management team the next slide we are in the process at the moment of um revising our risk management framework and this was a tool that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this is a direct um i guess exit out of the risk management framework and one of the things that we get the feedback back from staff all the time is how do we make it simple so what we 've been able to use is this tool and really break it down into seven simple questions um just in regards to how staff can actually go through and assess their risks and be clear on actually um what they need to do what they 're trying to achieve what are their barriers and what 's going to stop them from doing it um how can they actually go about their work in ensuring that they can use existing controls or existing um practices within the organisation to achieve what they want um ensuring that what they 're actually doing is i guess in line with councils uh risk advertiser tolerance um what further actions do they need to do and how do they know they 're going to be successful so we 've used we 're starting to use this tool now across the organisation to really help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final slide um we have and and jump in if you want as well um but one of the things i guess of what we 're looking to do now is undertake some further engagement with our elected members one of the things that we we have been lucky with is that our members are engaged in the topic of climate change um they are wanting to see progress here they are wanting um the council to progress in this space so and the main discussions has really been with the infrastructure and strategy committee which is a subset committee of council it has six elected members on it um and we can see that it would be great to get leverage with that committee in regards we 've been able to try and progress some of the actions that are in and climate change adaptation programs the finance and audit committee is already engaged we have been working with them we 'll continue to monitor the risks through that process and yeah and we 're also looking at a regional briefing and workshop um with our partner council so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a lot that each of the councils can learn from each other and by bringing them together we can get some of that peer learning and leadership as well um the other area that we 're really looking at is the staff capacity building as kate was mentioning before and as we 're developing our work area risk registers we 're looking at how we can embed some of those specific climate risks into work area registers and then also and in doing so we 'll be responding to some of the recommendations from the climate risk governance assessment and then obviously we 're continuing to review all of our corporate risks on an ongoing basis so that 's pretty much it for us i think we 've done well flying blind [Laughter] were there any questions okay and people are writing in questions i 'm not sure whether you can actually see the questions uh yourself um so firstly can you see the questions sorry are you able to see the questions if you can 't see the slides we lost the screen right back at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a fantastic job so um well there 's a few questions that are coming in now um but while they come in i might just ask uh one or two of my own uh so firstly considering that climate change is cross-cutting how was the executive champion allocated for this issue um yeah i think um the session well i mean obviously the general manager that is in my direct reporting line has been quite supportive although she 's now moved on to another council but i think the executive briefing that we had with the other councils back in i think it was about october last year and we had two of our three general managers go along to that session um and one of those tiny lines in particular has been quite proactive in you know having gone to that session he 's really taken up the baton i guess and and has been really supportive of us getting action in that area and he 's i 'm a general manager from another um line so he i mean so kate theory and my area don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way because it 's that cross organizational response okay fantastic um and i have a question here from noosa council um there 's a group of them and and they 're actually interesting because they themselves gave a webinar a few weeks ago um so so they 're very much in this space as well and so their question is what was the community 's response to the risk register post-disclosure particularly related to the climate change component positive negative hungry for more detail what was the community 's response to be honest we have i guess heard um very little in regards from the community in regards to our actual risk report i think what we find is that um we have more of a response i guess if anne presents her adaptation plans and those type of things to counsel uh for adoption but however in regards to the actual risk side of it i mean from a community contact or expectation point of view um you know we actually have very little contact um from the community about disclosing the risks so i guess the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they actually engaged with that i 'm not quite sure yeah um i guess that said though we recently through another program we have a monthly common thread sustainability event here um and we recently had a climate change super session where we had well i gave an update on council what council was doing and we also had a number of other speakers and that was very well attended and there was a lot of interest from the community so i think it 's maybe how people in a community are accessing are they 're certainly interested in what council 's doing around climate change but whether it 's yeah i don 't think they 're necessarily accessing it through the risk disclosure um that particular avenue they might be going through a different avenue related to say your sustainability planning or it might come through um say land use planning is that a fair like do you think they 're actually accessing the information through a different avenue of council or is it um that they 're just concerned about the issue generally i think there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean i and my team we do get um calls from people when we do talk to people in the community i mean for example tonight i 'm one of um the members of my team has been working on a coastal climate adaptation plan we 've got a community a meeting down at halac cove tonight to share some of the findings from that report and look at what things need to be doing going forward and there 's been a bit of interest i mean i 'm interested to see how it will go tonight as well but i think we have had some good interest in the community about that process as well so it just depends on where the um the hot topics of individuals in the community are i think as to how they want to access the information i guess the other part sorry just jumping quickly is that by having it publicly disclosed it actually gives permission for the team to be actually out of user as part of their further work that they are doing with the community as well so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it allows the team to then go on and use it in in other in other ways yeah absolutely okay so i have a question here from david powell have you had to deal with any climate skeptics amongst um elected members or staff and how did you deal with it um well i 'll answer from the elected member point of view um we have had uh climate change get ticked i guess from our elected members in the past however i think there 's been the minority um so what has happened is i guess in the course of any normal council meeting um and this is the way that democracy obviously works is that items are put forward they debate that those that obviously have their views um against climate change or not supporting that they 'll have their say and then like anything within a council meeting if it gets a majority vote it goes through so um we haven 't necessarily had i think any problems in that space because it is the minority it 's not the majority of the council that certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff perspective the one of the key roles that i think i have in the organisation is to work with people across the organisation to help them to make the connection with climate change that 's relevant to their work so i do spend a fair amount of time doing that we had 120 staff members voluntarily respond to the climate um survey that we ran as part of the commerce governance assessment and which i think was is fantastic we 've got about 400 staff here so i think that 's a fairly good um percentage and 40 people participating in the interviews and again they 're all very positive conversations so i don 't necessarily i mean there may be people that are not speaking up around that to me know my position i guess but um i don 't feel like it 's a big issue in terms of how we move forward it 's all about making it real for people that they do um so i 'm going to come back nurses got a second question but i 'll i 'll come back to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melissa from from livingston uh council up in up in queensland and it 's did you start with some did you start small with some initiatives first before completing a climate change policy was drafted and then presented to council essentially um how did you start uh in terms of kicking this off in terms of your work and what let 's say what are the top three things that if you were starting out uh your work in this space that you would recommend to other i think um at had a very very long um journey i guess i don 't like using that word too often but i mean we were back in the late 90s even we were working with um equally on the city for climate protection program we 're one of the earlier participants in that um and as i said we 've had this regional approach now for eight years or so with resilient south and we do take regular reports to council whether it be just um to provide an update or i mean i i 'm generally quite opportunistic so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll include some climate change information as part of that report as well so it 's it 's kind of a constant um feature of a number of reports i know i work with other teams as well to do the same thing so if there 's a report going up about something that another work area is working on we 'll also try and bring in the climate change perspective into that as well um so i don 't feel as though i think it 's just that continual um providing information updates having conversations um so i haven 't actually felt that it 's been too hard to be quite honest i don 't know if that 's that 's what people are looking for but again appreciated by a whole lot of uh councils online at the moment um so [Music] so i guess i 've had a long time to build up relationships with people as well so and i can 't underestimate the importance of building strong working relationships be it with other um staff and and teams within the organization but also with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a good rapport with quite a number of the elected members and i can have quite good conversations with them about this stuff as well so um i think that 's been a positive way of working to enable us to progress the way that we have yeah um and i suppose that that 's one of the a lot of these uh webinars that we have seem to get back to how to get through to either the ceo and executive level or how to get through to those um those elected members um in terms of saying that this is an important issue and how to how making uh improvements in corporate governance is is important for for responding to climate change have you got any thoughts on on those issues beyond that i think i mean i think what i 've seen is since that we 've been framing it around um risk it 's actually elevated to another level and i think people across the organization actually can see a lot more how it 's relevant for them and the work that they 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know if you would yeah i 'd agree with that i guess the other component of how we 've actually risked how we 've actually framed it as well is around um i guess not actually having a full understanding of this stage of what the financial impacts are for the council in the long term based on climate change mainly from an asset management point of view so we really haven 't been able to define it yet which is one of the reasons why it 's sitting as a high risk on our risk register because we know that we need to do further work in that space to really understand what is the what is going to be the impact for the organisation in the longer term and from a financial perspective and how 's that actually going to i guess impact back on our community and our rate payers um so i think sometimes with our exact teams when you start pitching things of of from a financial perspective um and that there could be some big dollars attached to it it certainly didn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong but is that about reframing climate change away from being say an environment sustainability issue and putting it in the context of risk and finance is that a correct interpretation of what you 're what you 're talking about i think so but it 's not i guess taking it away it 's um it 's having a more holistic view to it that you know this isn 't just about the environmental impact but it it 's also going to impact on the organization um from a bottom line perspective so it 's looking at i guess the risk more broadly um and ensuring that it 's encompassing um different factors to it yeah fantastic so i 've got that follow-up on um nurse 's question and they 're and they 're basically saying that uh what you were talking about in terms of the community 's response to to to disclosure you know in effect that they probably don 't resp see much or hear much or it 's not a big thing but it gives you something to to go forward with um that 's basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their areas of interest at the moment is does the council have a policy position on retreat or managed retreat in the face of coastal erosion but i suppose that 's relevant to other climate change issues as well so does the council have a policy position on retreat um no we don 't um i guess the nature of our coastline is that it is quite rocky as well i mean there have been some low-lying areas where we 've had to um put some different i guess caveats around development in certain areas where they are low-lying but um no we don 't at this point in time that 's not to say that we may not in the future at the moment it really it 's more around our assets and community assets in that area that may be subject to um damage through whether it 's whether not they 're on a cliff area or that sort of thing so um but no not a retreat um policy position okay um so it looks like uh we 've got one final question coming in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i suppose as we walk the wrap up the webinar um do you have any final final tips in terms of oh okay the question is what is an example of an adaptation approach that you 've used sorry i 'm just going to see what what 's an adaptation approach well i mean i guess that 's the approach that we are taking with our coastal um climate adaptation planning is that we 're really um looking at what the current system and current impacts are and doing some quite detailed analysis of the cliffs and rocky shoreline that we do have along our coast and trying to understand what other things that we need to be doing in the short medium and long term particularly around our assets whether it be um coastal access trails and water infrastructure and roads roads and walking paths and that sort of thing and using a database or an evidence-based approach to make those decisions around council resourcing so we 've got a couple of hot spots that we 're looking at that may need some more short-term attention um and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thoughtfully i guess and more um with that kind of adaptation response in mind and thank you and final question is coming in from maggie hine um from the i think it 's the city of pay um and the question uh yeah and the question is um has the regional approach helped marion in its climate risk management so just about that reason i think absolutely i think absolutely i think i mean given i mean it was just um city of marion city of oncopreneur in our resilient south region but the two um councils in resilient hills and coast as well to the four of us working together um i think has been really beneficial back in august we had a two council debriefing session with marion and nankapranga where we had about 80 staff from across the two organizations come together in the one location to to hear about the assessment outcomes and and do um some work around what we need to be doing next and i think that um collaborative approach where you 've got people from different organizations um being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others can learn from that i think has worked really well and i think we 're continuing to see the benefits of that regional approach fantastic well i think that 's time to time to wrap up and i suppose i 'd like to just finish by by thanking um both ann and kate for for taking your time out and putting together this presentation and and sharing um so much of what you 're doing it 's super valuable um i think to to the participants and that 's what we 're hearing and and it 's really valuable to hear about what you 're doing to to get ahead and do things that um i i know and other accounts other counselors have told me is particularly challenging related to to sharing that information um so thank you thank you and um just a final bit of information that this is that the climate change innovation lab and i 'm aware that several of the people um this is your first webinar um that you 've been to what we 're we 're actually taking a break uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the last webinar for through for a little bit um and we 're just trying to work out our current uh standpoint and essentially we 've been doing this for six months and we 've done we 've done 12 webinars and we are just taking a short break to recalibrate and turn it into um something that 's bigger and better um but keep in touch and uh we look forward to having you on for future webinars in the future for very similar talks thank you very much thank you you,"(-20.4018362,

AUS,QLD,Whitsunday Regional Council,Whitsunday Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp2KXCWMXIgmDYxRg4lVpxg,WCCIH _ Webinar - Dr Johanna Loehr _ Rethinking Tourism - System Change for Tourism Destinations,YxbYzbZy8gY,20210129,2323.44,"Proserpine QLD 4800, Australia",5597,we are very lucky at the hub to be guided by a panel of experts including professor suzanne beckham who presented our last webinar that looked at redesigning and redefining tourism focusing on what was happening in new zealand today 's webinar follows on by looking at the systems change in the tourism sector the events of the past year have had severe impacts on tourism globally revealing major shortcomings and vulnerabilities in the past weaknesses in the system have been disregarded in favor of promises of short-term economic development and growth in this webinar it is argued that transformational change is required to rethink the tourism system we 're lucky today to be joined by dr joanna leur we have worked with her on a past project last year she has just completed her doctorate with griffith university and is here today to present her research on reducing climate risk to destinations in the south pacific using systems thinking system thinking looks at overall structures patterns and cycles of a system rather than focusing on specific events dr leur will discuss her concerns about solutions common and commonly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformational systems wide change in a coastal destination vulnerable to climate change such as the whitsundays johanna is going to provide a 20 minute presentation and at the end of the presentation we will have time for questions please keep your microphones muted during the presentation you may also like to turn off your video to get a higher quality connection you can use the chat function to type in any questions and we will go through those questions at the end and we are recording this webinar so it will be available very soon on the whitsunday climate change innovation hub website so we 'll go straight into johanna 's presentation thanks for joining us johanna thanks olivia so let me share my screen right can you see that perfect um right and thanks for having me olivia and for the introduction so um as olivia said my talk today focuses on system change in destinations through different leverage points and i 'll explain what those leverage points or what leverage points are um as olivia said my presentation is informed by my phd um where the focus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destinations but i 'll try and keep it you know general enough or make links to um what that means for other destinations including the um with sundays um why are we even talking about system change um olivia i 'm getting a bit of a feedback i don 't know if maybe if you meet yourself or if others haven 't made it themselves that might help um so why are we even talking about system change um before covet hit the argument was that tourism in small small island developing states and other coastal destinations is highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change tourism in many cases is also quite resource intense and in vanuatu the majority of tourists come by plane or cruise ship from australia new zealand and europe so quite a far distance away and that in itself bears a high risk to future changes in carbon policy or behaviour change despite those risks vanuatu invested in tourism with the hope to improve people 's lives and to ensure that tourism can act as a sustainable development option and deliver real benefits to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change risks needs to be addressed so this is basically where i 'm coming from so now um with covert um that and that international tourism is on hold um almost globally there is a concern that maybe it is not only the location that 's vulnerable but tourism as an industry is vulnerable to certain shocks this stop on tourism or this halt we 're experiencing leaves many to demand this moment to be used to address the shortfalls of tourism and people are questioning um if the costs so you know environmental and social that tourism brings with it outweigh the benefits tourism creates in the last webinar um that was hosted by the climate change hub um susanna beckham was saying that if not now um you know will tourism ever change so in this context many agree with this need for transformation and you know transformation is a word that 's been used quite frequently in recent time transformational change has been defined using words such as significant profound radical and fundamental and transformation is a process you know it 's it 's not describing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as either a negative change or outcome or a positive one so important is um that transformation refers to the depth of change and clear is also that to achieve such change we cannot revert back to business as usual so the problem with change especially such deep change is not is that it 's not easy to implement and i thought this was a pretty good um illustration to to reflect you know some of the challenges so how to address those complex problems that we 're facing or that destinations are facing and you know obviously climate change is one of them but there are others um you know sustainability um challenges um resilience um something that olivia mentioned you know is a as a focus of the hub but also the covert recovery and you know how can we inform such transformational change a way of better understanding complex problems is through systems thinking the issue is that often we see a problem as an event or a situation at this present moment in time and act by finding solutions to this particular situation by addressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we 're experiencing flooding or even by moving to higher grounds however in doing so we fail to address the underlying cause of the problem so that could be sea level rise or climate change you know over consumption or you know even population growth if we 're sort of you know taking a wider angle systems thinking provides us with a bigger picture of the situation and helps us understand the structure and behavior of our systems that causes those problems or events to happen systems thinking therefore helps us to shift our approach from reacting to problems or from reacting to problems to becoming more proactive and anticipatory so i 'm not sure how familiar everyone is with systems thinking so i 'm just providing a really brief overview of how it can be applied to destinations because my you know next sort of points build on gap systems and so as part of my phd i learned how important it is to view destinations including tourism businesses but also the local community and environment as an interconnected whole and of course there 's also you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socioeconomic and political processes that you know will need to be considered so this is because only when we see it as um you know this whole um or from a to a holistic lens can we identify interventions that don 't create negative or unintended consequences to other parts of the system and developing such a system allows us to identify what elements the system is made up of how those elements interlink and what feedback loops create system behavior and this is important because it helps us to answer those questions that you can see here so um what systemic change changes are needed what system characteristics enable or restrict such change and based on this identify how to intervene and so the remainder of this presentation will focus on the last question and i do think that it adds well um or adds on well from the previous presentation where there was a bit of interest and discussion around finding levers for change so in systems places to intervene where small change can have a large effect are called leverage points and as part of my phd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in my case points to intervene in vanuatu destination systems to reduce climate change risk um i do want to point out that this you know the this work or those thoughts are built on you know existing thinking around leverage points in systems more generally so today i want to talk about seven leverage points for system change in destinations and i 'll start at the shallow end so that means with leverage points that are easier to implement but change is you know rather small or incremental and then move towards deeper leverage points which are more difficult to implement as you will notice but they have the potential to achieve significant system change or transformational change um again the leverage points they focus on climate change risks to destinations in vanuatu and i put that in brackets because really and you know some of those lessons are um or ideas are certainly relevant to other destinations um as well so starting at the shallow end the first two leverage points are levers are to change the parameters of the system so in forms of numbers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that is to enhance the integration of tourism and climate change policies and again i 'm referring to climate change here but you know if the focus um is on um conservation or biodiversity then you know that would most likely apply as well so the integration of tourism and climate change policies um in vanuatu vanuatu actually has more recently released a new sustainable tourism policy which links which gets that links or integration between tourism and climate change quite well but there is still a need to ensure that tourism is represented in national climate change policies and plan plans including being identified in those climate change documents as a priority area and this is something to consider for other destinations including the whitsundays as well and it 's not just relevant for national documents but also at local level and so when i talk about integration it means that you know a climate change plan or policy considers tourism in their priorities or objectives and actions and tourism plans and policies consider climate change and of course also that tourism direct policy directions goals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the climate change targets that have been set and you know in many cases this is actually quite common that those don 't align so the next leverage point is to look at funding mechanisms or sources for climate risk reduction in tourism there are different sources internally or through external funds especially in vanuatu the recommendation was to strengthen system mechanisms that [Music] focus or strengthen those internal mechanisms that allow a trickling down of funding to on-the-ground small businesses so for example through small grant schemes um funding mechanisms are different in the wood sundays obviously and you know the wood sundays is not reliant on aid but it 's generally important to be aware of the conditions or interests attached to funding and the mechanisms of how funding is distributed and whether that aligns with what you know you want this funding to achieve and again this is relevant to climate change but also for other areas so you know maybe you generate tourism or any other sort of sustainability focused projects um so moving on um the next leverage point focuses on changing system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologies feedback loops either reinforce or balance the behavior of a system and so understanding and then changing those feedback loops can be quite powerful one example is for tourism to work with nature rather than against it to strengthen ecosystem health basically and this has a lot of positive flow and effects to the water destination so an example um you know a climate change specific example would be for tourism to invest in or implement ecosystem-based adaptation so ecosystem-based adaptation is our initiatives or an approach that strengthens ecosystem that naturally provide a buffer and reduce climate change risks so for example revegetating coastal areas or also actively increasing the health and resilience of a coral reef this is because as these ecosystems grow stronger and healthier the ecosystems are less susceptible to damage from climate change um which and again increases their you know ability to provide a buffer function and then again you know healthy ecosystems also help increase destination attractive attractiveness and provide a lot of other ecosystem services that you know have flown effects to the destination so um these are um you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destinations and including the wet sundays so the next two um leverage points and i 'm moving sort of towards more um deeper leverage points is to change the design of the system so you know the destination system and that can be done for example by changing the information flow um for through developing networks across sectors and decision making levels for example um you know getting people from tourism and other sectors to exchange information and sitting together and developing strategies also and this might be more applicable to vanuatu investing in education and development of destination specific data around you know climate information and this is really because there is not a lot of you know knowledge and understanding within the tourism sector of what businesses can do to address some of those climate change risks so really that can help increase capacities then the next leverage point is to increase local participation in decision-making and tourism um in vanuatu currently foreign investment and decision making is really high um however empowering local people and including women to participate and influence tourism development and destination has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements are linked and really the structure of the system it improves self-organization and it was also argued that it can contribute to you know the flexibility of people variability between destinations and in a way contribute to resilience towards climate change and i guess in a way this can be questioned now with covet especially in cases like vanuatu where there 's no tourists um however in a way giving people local people decision making power and you know still provides agency and of course it also means that benefits that are generated through tourism go to those people directly and that those people can determine what shape those benefits might take and so when i was thinking about you know those leverage points and how they might relate to the with sundays i thought that in terms of changing system design or you know how some of those system elements link it could also be useful to review what products are offered and to whom so who 's actually coming and to the destination are these domestic tourists or international and um whether that makes a difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little um you know anecdote from the whitsundays actually so i went um on a sailboat in october um to do like a sailing trip in the wet sundays and um the boat i went on there was two other couples as guests and um the um operator and captain told us that this tour so it was a longer tour um and two days and uh four nights and i think four days around that and the captain said that this actually is a new format now that they have only implemented after covert to cater for domestic tourists he was telling us that before and they received they received a lot of international tourists and their tours were only two nights and two days um roughly or three days but two nights um and that meant that they were doing several tours a week not just one long tour um it meant that the crew had a lot a lot less time at home and with you know social replications and the tours were rushed so they were all always going to the same places and those must-see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see and they were saying that now that they have different type of visitors their tours look very different and you know it has a positive impact on their families and also the way they conduct their tours because they have a lot more time to go to different anchorages and they have a lot more time they have a lot more time sailing so again um you know i don 't even want to um yeah you know expand on this much more but it just shows that there 's those flow and effects and links that are created just because all of a sudden they 're receiving domestic tourists who are willing to spend a bit more time and so then moving on to the deepest leverage points um which are focused on changing system intent and this can be done by changing the goals of the system often people are frustrated with the outcome systems produce and in many instances this is not due to faulty system design but because the goals are defined wrongly so in the context of reducing climate change risk and increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include asking questions such as you know what a resilience of what or for whom and why do we want to be resilient and for a broader context of tourism development or to rethink tourism in the face of covert those questions that could be asked may include what do we actually want tourism for so obviously you know these questions are not easy to answer and obviously they 'll be varied viewpoints on what the correct answers are one thing i think that became really clear to me when i did my climate change study is that if the goal the system goal is to grow gdp it won 't help address climate change so instead a focus um on creating community well-being under changing climate will generate really different system outcomes so the way the goal is defined and importantly measured um is really important and often overlooked i think and so the final and deepest leverage point is to shift paradigms and this is because the underlying paradigm determines system structure behavior and intent and therefore influences all the previous level leverage points that i talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still really strong however there are also high expectations for people to participate in the global cash economy and western capitalism has influenced policies and also how tourism is developed and this has implications including implications for you know climate change and climate change risk reduction because there is a strong push for growth and development of coastal properties and people moving to you know pray those exposed and more vulnerable locations and you know moving away from their land and things like that so one thing i 've learned from doing my phd in vanuatu is that when it comes to values and views that may help us address climate change we have a lot to learn from the indigenous peoples of the south pacific as they have an intrinsic understanding of how the human and environmental elements of our system link i have less experience working with indigenous people in australia but i am quite sure that they would have a similar view about the human and environmental relationship and susanna mentioned that some examples from the maoris in new zealand and her webinar as well that reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here i do think that there is an opportunity to incorporate this more holistic understanding to inform tourism development and to create broader benefits through tourism so what does this mean for the whitsundays um we can have a discussion about this if you like if there 's any questions or you can also think about this further in your own time but here are a few pointers or questions and generally um i guess to recap recent times have highlighted that there is a need to transform the tourism system and but change can go in many direction and what is perceived as positive or negative outcomes varies between people and interest groups so not everyone you know has the same views on what is a good um change or a system outcome so um we need to be clear on who 's part of the destination system and you know we can be thinking local stakeholders or you know including you know children if you want to go as far as even talking about future generations that 's often done in climate change or um you know um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that uh from zanda that new zealand is increasingly doing this and what the varying priorities are of those system elements and then are there any trade-offs between those priorities also important to think about is what outcomes should the tourism or destination system actually produce there are different countries and cities who are looking at expanding or redefining what they consider successful development or successful you know economic outcomes so there 's a lot of thinking happening in this space and um you know is is this in line with the actual current net outcomes that tourism delivers so net outcomes because you know it 's important to consider both the positive and negative outcomes or impacts that tourism has has if not it might help to look at if the goals that were set for tourism with sundays or more broadly you know council for the community or you know any others um you know goals um yeah what are they and um what is actually measured and reported on and i think this um should hopefully give you an indication of what drives decisions and ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have to share with you today but obviously if there 's any questions or comments i 'm more than happy to keep the discussion going um or even later on if there 's anything that you want to ask feel free to reach out to me directly or via olivia thank you everyone everyone should be able to unmute themselves now so thank you joanna that was really interesting um i certainly got another way of thinking about how we can potentially do the exact opposite of what i 've been focusing on which is integrating climate change through all the other plans and and bringing tourism back this way as well so that 's very interesting um does anybody have any questions for joanna on on anything she 's presented today people might need a moment to think about it yeah sure so i suppose um i 'll ask a question then so um all of the ideas you 've um provided how do you think they could also be used to inform tourism recovery in response to covet um yeah so obviously you know that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about tourism recovery at the moment so um because there has been such a drastic change and stop in a way to tourism um it 's a good time to really take a moment to reflect and take stock and even as a community talk about some of those fundamental questions that i 've mentioned um like you know what what what do we want tourism for what you know what do we want out of it what um you know is it currently delivering and is there you know what type of change do we need so i think those fundamental questions um to reflect on what tourism was like and where it might need to go or should go i think is you know quite important and probably a good time and now to um to have those discussion and to involve the community so something else that i 've learned from you know my climate change studies and olivia you may you know experience that as well is that it 's really important to involve a wide range of stakeholders so you know it 's quite obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking at this from a whole of destination perspective um you know i found it 's quite important to include you know community representatives and and maybe even um yeah you know sectors that sort of link to tourism um different types of community representatives to ensure different groups are represented and having those different viewpoints also helps to really look at things more holistically because people would look at it through their different lenses and understanding of of the destination so i think that 's quite important to point out so i think um yeah there 's a lot of i mean i 've framed this all around system as a destination being a system but um you know beyond that i think there 's this recognition that there is a tourism system and that this system need to change um now with what happened with kovitz i think using that systems or more holistic lens to look at how tourism is linked with other sectors and the community and is quite useful actually to um identify some opportunities for change did anyone else have a question for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting is about the um environmental and social questions and um the suggestion that um tourism is doing damage and it 's really interesting because i know here for the whitsundays that the majority of the operators would are the ones that want to take the lead and they 're the ones that are if you like the eyes on what 's happening and they 're also the ones that are most concerned about the change that 's being experienced and i think as we move forward that it 's these operators and these tourism um people that are investing in the staff that are working in tourism that are our hope so i think we need to be very careful how we um how we react to that because there is a general suggestion that all the damage is being done it 's just you tourism operators that are causing the issue and that 's you know and i i think it 's actually the reverse if you actually peel back a few layers of the onion and and and the tourism industry is the way that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but um i think you know some of the frameworks that we 've had through ecotourism and climate adaptation and other programs that have been run have set us in a good position we 're not there yet but we 're working in partnership with the great barrier reef marine park authority and and and queensland parks and the community and i think while we 've got a long way to go we 've forged quite a good partnership and we 're starting on the correct way forward and policy 's being changed to reflect that as well um yeah that 's a really good and important comment and i mean to be fair you know i didn 't mean to say that you know the um tourism operators are creating you know all the problems i think it 's from my point of view looking at this you know from a very big picture and you know what 's happening in vanuatu with you know being relying on international tourism and climate change um you know that um yeah that at a large scale there is an impact through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good examples where operators are doing really you know good work and i know there are a lot of good examples in the what sundays a lot of work you know has been done and is being done in olivia 's told me before that you know there is a real interest and um you know from operators and a real awareness um and that probably sets the wood centers apart from other destinations as well um so yeah i didn 't i i do appreciate that comment um and i think that idea and maybe that goes back to some of the you know examples that susana provided in her webinar of um using tourism to create you know more holistic or positive outcomes and this is something that you know the direction i kind of wanted to go with this as well yeah you know how can tourism be used to create those benefits to the wider destination to the community and have positive benefits um on the environment so it 's great to hear that you know there 's a lot um that 's been done or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question hey olivia quite a question and that 's all right sure uh john thanks for the presentation i 'm tony fonson with sunday conservation council and follow on to al 's comment regarding tourism stories certainly aren 't the cheerleaders for the reef but i think tourism can do more in the climate change field and i 'm wondering if you 've got suggestions on how we can get our tourism industry to be more vocal or outspoken in regards to protecting the roof from the impacts of climate change because there are powerful force when united but we have failed to i think really take advantage of that when it comes to moving government policy and climate change in this country um yeah i think that 's a good point and yeah i think um i mean there 's a i think we can all agree that there 's a need to you know move climate change policy in the country so at you know at higher decision um making levels and i think um you know tourism is an important industry in australia i do think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that and obviously and you would all understand you know the um the reef you know and just generally um ecosystem health is really um important to a successful tourism industry so um yeah how to leverage that to achieve policy change at a national level and that 's obviously a big question and i think there was similar questions um after zuzana 's webinar as well um you know in terms of governance and what a local destination can do to sort of achieve it will have an impact at that level um yeah i 'm not too sure yet but they 're certainly interesting questions and i do think that examples show that um you know if there 's momentum um and people sort of unite behind a strong or common purpose um and that could be to address climate change or you know protect the reef that others do take notice do we have any other final questions before we sign off today all right well thank you johanna for providing us a very um thought provoking presentation i hope everyone 's got a few little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more if anybody does want to provide any other feedback on the webinar please send us an email we are really interested to understand if you are benefiting from these webinars and how you think the system 's thinking could be applied to the recovery of the whitsunday destination or other destinations or your own businesses the hub is working with council and industry on mitigating and adapting to climate change and if you 're interested in any more information on the climate hub you can head to our website with sunday climate change innovation hub or follow us on facebook as i said earlier we 're going to share a recording soon there 's a website tab on the hubs website that has all of our past webinars and we will intend to keep digging into this topic a little bit further and we 'll release some more information shortly on our next webinar so thank you very much to everyone for joining us today and thanks joanna for presenting thanks olivia and thanks everyone for joining and you 're a great question thank you thanks for arranging thank you well done everyone

top,lQ3W4opJEnM,20210106,2296.4,"Proserpine QLD 4800, Australia",5833,at the local level you 're at the at the forefront of any impacts and we you are where the rubber hits the road and what i 'll talk about today i 'll just talk about just briefly introduce why i think we need to focus on mainstreaming climate change or adaptation governance that 's a term i 'll use interchangeably with mainstreaming i 'll give some examples of where i think there has been some good practice the examples come from my work with as ian said a couple hundred local governments where i 've done that at least the scoping assessment of councils around australia and um if you want to know why they 're queensland victoria tasmania and south australia specific that 's because that 's where i 've done the work so far about to undertake some work in western australia soon as well and then of course i 'll open it up for questions if it 's okay with everybody i think i 'll take the questions at the very end so if you can just make some notes and then send those questions through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstreaming there 's a lot of um as with many things in any of the academic literature you know there 's various definitions around what mainstreaming is uh but ultimately mainstreamings just generally mean something is constantly taken into account reflected and integrated into the sort of decision making process and so it becomes the normal aspect of day-to-day activities now um if we look at um what 's going on in australia and actually all the way around the world there 's actually not much mainstreaming going on there 's a lot of conversation around mainstreaming um but it 's just recognizing that climate change adaptation is um is quite complex it 's ever-changing the nature of risk is changing i think some of the physical risks are relatively simple but it 's that cascading impacts that are going to i think catch a lot of local governments out of course reactionary adaptation leads to potential trade-offs and you know i 've been working with local governments for you know about 13 years now and i know there 's always a loser in every decision and so we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges um local governments already do governance so you already actually have systems in place to mainstream just general decision making and so you know this is just a new lens um and i 'll predominantly talk about climate change adaptation but also i 'll be teasing out mitigation as well and we can talk about that this is my only academic slide um and this comes from some interesting work done on the agricultural sector where it talks about you know sort of three stages um or pathways for climate change responding to climate change and there 's the from incremental or they call it coping uh to system change and then transformational change now at the moment you know at best i think what we 're doing is we 're looking at coping mechanisms by including climate change in your core governance instruments at the very at least it 's going to help you deal with those coping you know just general coping from day-to-day responses uh but ultimately we need to get to the systemic change and that 's where local governments can take the lead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about systematic system to make change however the transformational change in the academic literature there 's a lot of conversations around what the need to have transformational change um and i think that 's going to be very difficult in terms of in terms of the control from local governments in australia so for transformational change we might actually have to look at things like the changing role of local government and those relationships with the state i think especially in the land use planning space you know you 're very very limited there so today where i think the key there are five key sort of focus areas or levers for change and for mainstreaming climate change into local government and i 'll go through those but a corporate plan or if you 're in tasmania it 'd be a strategic plan or if you 're in south australia strategic management plan plan or council plan in victoria you know they all have differing names but ultimately it 's the key document that that just drives decision making there 's financial management which is not being done well at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of guiding policies so if we start with corporate planning this is i think you know one of the most important levers for change when we 're looking at mainstream decision making ultimately the corporate plan is how local governments discharge their responsibilities under the various local government acts and because it comes through the local government act and then into the corporate plan if it 's in the corporate plan then it 's considered a council budget it usually has a number of council activities connected to it when there are presentations done to the elite members it 's usually referenced back in the council template it 's discussed in the annual reports and any disclosure activities and depending on what state you 're in if it 's in the corporate or strategic plan there 's also audits some councils undertake audits based on their corporate plan i know that this is the case in tasmania so they 'll get an independent body to see if an organization is actually doing what they 're saying they aim to do in the corporate plan so in terms of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think are worthwhile looking at um mornington peninsula shire melbourne city it 's a really big show pony city of course um and then anka parinka city council in south australia um what i 'll do is i 'll also send the um links to ian for the documents that i 'm referring to when i 'm talking about the leading councils there are other councils that are doing pretty well in the space but just for um remedy these are just some examples um ultimately you know good practice you should see climate change being specifically mentioned in all the council functions of the um of the corporate plan often it 's just sits in the environment um environmental or the sustainable objectives and if you 're looking at mainstreaming you need to shift it into all of the areas i think mornington britain has a really good example of that we need to start considering the direct and indirect impacts of climate change so you know it 's not just the physical impacts we 're looking at issues around say the local economy or insurance availability mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsibilities allocated and of course resourcing allocated and i 'll get to that later on in the finance component and then ultimately we need key performance indicators because if we don 't uh measure it um you can 't manage it for financial management i 've just put this slide which you 've probably seen it 's a lot of lately around the task force on climate-related financial disclosures tcfd i believe ian edwards spoke about that but that 's going to have considerable impacts for councils um but it 's mainly in indirect so it 's not um there won 't be direct issues but we need to um start mainstreaming climate change into the financial management systems because you know ultimately is is a finite financial risk for councils um the leading councils latrobe city council in victoria adelaide hills council in south australia has got some really good considerations of financial management and on caparenko city council i bring them up not um not for what they 're doing now but what they 've done in the past so um encourage city council set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their sort of annual budget to climate change about 45 percent of that was allocated to adaptation and the risk went to mitigation activities um to date they spent approximately three and a half million dollars so they 've raised a fair bit of money into that fund i think of i think they raised about five million overall but that unfortunately the climate response fund has finished in terms of input but they still have some money in there at the moment in terms of looking at you know good practice sort of questions you know we need to ask councils or the cfo probably should be asking is you know how much money does an organization need say one to three years just to understand that risk what is the value of all the ethics exposed to climate hazards you know what are the potential costs associated with adaptation planning you know like let 's say rolling out sea walls for example what 's the potential impact on income i think it 's going to be a sleeper for some councils especially councils who rely heavily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because i think we 're going to see a big impact on property values in the next two to five years in that space what 's the potential impact on service delivery and how much has council actually how much have extreme events in the past actually costed council i know most councils you know have job numbers for the extreme events but they they often don 't report on that so it 's really important that councils do that um how much money is council saved due to actions that 's always useful for presenting to the elected members um and then the probably a more difficult one is you know to what extent has council invested in carbon intensive industries some councils are divesting from fossil fuels um but i haven 't seen any examples of councils pulling out of climate exposed industries so a good example of that might be you know property development on the gold coast um a good question to ask is you know does council have a climate fund and then also what external influence is is emerging so in some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to ask questions around climate change and the reason why it 's coming out of state treasury is because the credit rating agencies are actually asking the question of of the states now and councils are a function of the states in terms of asset management well of course you know asset climate change can impact on uh just asset choice so you know council might need different types of assets so if we 're having this shift towards electrification of vehicles then they 'll need to be charging stations um asset maintenance regimes we 're already seeing an impact on road maintenance regions because of extreme weather asset depreciation that 's always a sensitive issue for a lot of councils that can affect their sort of their bottom line but ultimately i think climate change will impact on asset depreciation and then the asset service delivery or expect a service delivery i think it 's really interesting you know there was an example i won 't say which council it was in but when we were doing some risk quantification we looked at you know we found 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by about 20 50 but then when we were talking with the sewage team they actually said well actually it 'll affect their supply their viable ability to service those sites by about 20 30 and they don 't actually think that they have there 's enough money or capacity to ensure that those communities are serviced with sewage that 's a really interesting threshold there moment for councils i think what 's really important you know we 're looking at good practice for asset management with local governments it 's around i think quantifying um councils often ad hoc have done some really proactive understanding of how climate change may affect them but they 're not quantifying it and i call on councils to actually go through and quantify the extent of exposure so kilometers of a road for example exposed to sea level rise or increase you know in a riverine inundation and what is the value of that exposure this is really important for your key performance and indicators and monitoring evaluation later on but also it 's critical that that links back to the financial management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have visual representation i 'll show you an example of that in a moment ultimately i think it 's critical that you treat data as an asset so many local governments that have gone into have poor data management systems and this is you know even really large uh almost billion dollar uh councils have uh poor data management so it 's critical for climate change management that 's considered this is an example i think from um it was from bayside council in victoria and they actually had climate change really well considered in their asset management plans and policies and they have depending on what the asset management plan is they have various checklists for their climate change risk this is a publicly available document so i can send you the link to that but i thought that that was quite interesting to see that they 're actually starting to go through that process where you can actually have a checklist this is an example of kingston beach in tasmania where they were having data visualization around the exposure this is the current exposure to one percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows a different value but also the length of roads or the number of assets and then when you jump up to 2100 of course that increases over time but these visuals are really useful for especially when you 're talking to the community and the elected members now risk disclosure is often a really topical or sensitive issue um people don 't like airing their dirty laundry in public but it 's something that i think is actually a fundamental component of mainstream decision making i mean ultimately um you know the community is of the shareholders and i think it 's important that they understand what the risks are for council otherwise you know you 're making decisions in the dark and i 've actually only found one really and i think it 's a really good example of um public disclosure of risk in the country and that 's the city of marion in south australia and and actually we 'll be talking um in a few weeks time about what what they do around this disclosure but what i thought was interesting is i just grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public um disclosure of risks so they look at the catastrophic damage of course the assets you know from extreme weather but they also look at you know the risk of remedial works cost of mitigation dissatisfied community they consider reduced rates revenue with property values um issues associated with insurance uh issues associated with lending risk and of course infrastructure infrastructure damage but that webinar i think will be really useful um to see what what marion are actually doing in that space and then the final of the of of the top five that i think is really important and i think actually all these people might be in the room today with the leading councils as having a guiding policy or a corporate standard where you can specifically define the roles of council in regards to managing climate change stating you know who will be if how will climate change be considered who 's it going to be led by within council what scenario or scenarios are going to decide guide your decision making um what are the key sources of information where are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government who were choosing um a csiro climate change model or just by itself for no other reason than the fact that the modelling came from an australian entity that local government was actually looking at that data for the creation of a dam and when we we actually looked into um the climate models that they could have used or should have used and we found actually for that location the cyro model probably was the worst choice that they could choose and so they went from you know potential 20 decrease in rainfall to a 20 increase in rainfall which actually completely changed the damn uh design requirements critically uh you know a good practice uh policy your corporate standards should be you know what are you gonna review i always encourage people to try and review it within six months or if not 12 months from the next ipcc data i was talking to john church recently who 's the sea level rise expert and he was saying that you know the next ipc c is likely to have the upper bounds of sea level rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be really interesting for all those in the queensland area for example have just finished their chairs in space on 80 centimeters of sea level rise and then of course what performance indicators you know is council think they should use so they 're the top five but of course there are others you know what else and who else and i just wanted to i suppose just highlight some other councils that i think are doing some great stuff and there are other elements that we should be considering or council should be considering so community engagement is always a challenging process and i think buying far city of oncoparink has done some fantastic stuff from community engagement they have an artist in residence they 've got climate ready schools they 've done some great stuff on heatwave this is the same for marion council as well but i think you know look to ankapurinka and marion councils for community engagement good examples of community engagement on climate change issues um for greenhouse gas emissions you know if you don 't have a zero com a commitment to net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just you 're gonna miss the mark um melbourne city of course and adelaide of targets for uh knit zero by 2020 which is just next year nusa has something 2026. um you know there are some other interesting examples but i think ultimately you need to aim for net zero by 2050. interestingly in victoria over 25 of local governments in victoria actually have a target for net zero by 2050 and i think there 's only two in queensland in terms of institutional relationships i think you know the victorian local government 's do it really well with their greenhouse alliances and in south australia they 've got some great south australia sort of resilient regions like brazilian south brazilian adelaide for example um brazilian south has a fantastic website and i encourage you to have a look at that emergency management 's a you know really interesting one i think cairns is doing a fantastic job in that space considering climate change in that area too often you know with emergency management it focuses just on the response side of things but you need to be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery for legal risk um most councils won 't publish what they 've said about legal risk but i know that john won 't mind me saying that you know they 've actually had some work uh they had mark baker jones present to the elected members down in king brewer as well as justine bell wright an interesting piece on climate change and ground land services i don 't know if john can share that with you but i 'll let him volunteer himself there um and then landry 's planning to be honest i think for australia or anywhere in sweden um we are doing land use planning terribly in this country just in general um and then in around for climate change you know it there 's nothing really to highlight it 's some some stuff done in butterberg some stuff down in livingston south gippsland uh west coast but you know ultimately i 'd be looking to municipalities in offshore and that as part of that transformational change that i was talking about before because i think you know the states control majors planning so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um i just wanted to say that you know climate change governance is critical you know if you 're going to mainstream it you need to have climate change in as many council core instruments as possible um the hard part is you know i think to really get it to the next level is to get the chief financial officer and or the ceo to to have that buy and and lead from the top um when olga parenga had its um climate change response fund they actually had a ceo that said climate change you know it was one of his top five things he was going to focus on that five years that he was there and it makes a really big difference it 's critical that you understand and quantify the risks you can start the climate change you know process around governance you can look at that but you do need to understand what the risks are and quantify those risks so at some stage you 're going to have to under take some detailed climate change risk assessments i think collaboration is really key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the informal city governance assessments that i 've done and i know probably most of you who are listening have actually participated i just ask you to maybe share each other 's details and and consider swapping results so you can see who 's doing what i think that 's really important you know you don 't need to go from zero to hero if you 're not doing that well on some indicators just start small just get even just the word climate change and the introduction of a core piece of docket core document um just comment around ego it 's i 'm not having a go at anyone but you know ultimately um you know i 've seen some people that have been working with climate change space for a long time because in australia new zealand overseas and they find that you know disclosing their mainstreaming progress is almost like disclosing their you know how well they 're doing on their job but i think that 's not true and i think it 's really important to just disclose how you 're going and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i 'll leave that there i 'll be really keen on answering any questions if anybody has any thanks for your time yeah this is that okay here we go so from john given how complex looking into exposure quantification could be what is a good methodology to use yeah really good question john um look i think the the best thing to do is do it spatially at first so um you know you choose your hazards so you know let 's say it 's sea level rise for example you choose your time frame or multiple time frames and i think one of the um the best way of doing that is just spatial analysis most local governments have a gis officer simple spatial analysis is actually really simple to do now and so you can quite quickly um measure you know a number of homes exposed to certain property sometimes you know when we uh do that we try and work out you know is it is it just two-dimensional is it three-dimensional you know you look at the depth or is it just you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around exposure quantification though is think about the different data so you know you might use 80 centimeters of sea level rise but what happens if the commonwealth make is using 1.2 meters of sea level rise i know they are some of their scenario mappings so it 's really good to have outliers in that space so another question is climate change is often pigeonholed into the environment sustainability team how do you break it out of this i think it goes back to that issue of getting the ceo or cfo on board any um often any presentations from the task force on climate related financial disclosures the tcfd is really good to get the cfo or the ceo or the senior executives on board one of the things that i know worked really well for a particular council is that they got a a um a lawyer to present to the elected members and um mark baker jones did i think it was almost like an hour presentation to some elected members in the council about four years ago into the state they still talk about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people that aren 't actually in the environment or sustainability team get people who work in the finance industry you know go to the bloomberg website on climate change take that information and present it because ultimately you need to present it in the language that those people are used to speaking natural values and ecosystems at risk yeah no i haven 't seen really good examples of that to be honest john you know some of it is emerging out of the um the chairs process in um in queensland that 's the coastal hazard adaptation strategy that 's about 40 councils are participating so ultimately most of those assessments will be public so i know that whitsunday council have done some quantification of ecosystems uh sunshine coast council doing that and also um noosa council as well but you know valuing those natural values is is a challenge that 's a really good question was the loss of encarf a significant blow to local government progress on climate change i think the jury 's out there i think um you know personally i think yes um pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while to get its legs but you know when they had the coast adapts at all i think that had a lot of potential to um get this community of practice going you know we need a um a platform to have a community practice if we can share notes that 's what that incap could have done so i think it 's a significant blow not just a local government actually to everything you 've highlighted a range of corporate areas that are important if you have to identify or want to start with where would you start look i would start with the corporate plan um you know because that 's how an organization has just charged its responsibilities under the act um it 's really important that you start your framing with the community when it comes time to review the corporate plan or your strategic plan i think it 's really really critical so i would do that one first and then the second thing i would do would be the policy where you establish the rules of the game or that corporate standard create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start going through that process they 're doing it in a consistent manner the last thing you want is somewhat somebody in one department to be choosing you know information that 's different from a different department i 'm paying for some more questions while i 'm waiting for some questions i might just um let you know you know who i think are some councils who overall are doing some great stuff and and recommend that you go and have a look so of course i think anka parenchy council in south australia marion council port phillip council and victoria melbourne city council of course daraban city council has got some great stuff especially on carbon constrained environment kingbrook council hobart council hobart especially on the mitigation side of things so john 's just asked the question in the current area of budget balancing you know mentality in all levels of government how do we get traction and then you have to put it you have to measure it you have to measure the risk and put it into dollar values because what you 'll find is that once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to balance its books because of the climate change for risk and then hopefully they will act i think it 's really important there 's another question here how do you deal with elected members that are skeptical or apathetic or denying climate change um you know i think all you can do is keep on pointing them to the evidence into differing messengers so if you know if you 're a if you 've got a local member that doesn 't believe in climate change and wants to bring up neil plymouth as an example the the important thing is to recognize is that the the laws recognize climate change you know so just show them that doesn 't matter whether um you know their pers they 've got to separate their personal beliefs from their professional responsibilities and so you know if the law is recognizing climate change it doesn 't matter whether it 's real or not if the law recognizes it then you have to consider it if your insurer recognizes climate change then you should be considering it you know if if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect your um you know your residential property values that might then have an impact on your rateable income you need to consider it doesn 't really matter now you know it doesn 't matter if you believe it or not and specific examples relevant to the area community yes i think is that a question john i might need a bit of clarification on that question i call me that 's right yeah i mean you know like local um nothing quite like you know local impacts that make them understand put things into context i think the conversation around the commonwealth bank is really important i strongly encourage you if you haven 't already to download the commonwealth bank annual report because that 's a good thing to present to elected members um the annual report has about eight pages on climate change exposure and how they 're going to manage it and as of uh this financial year the commonwealth bank said that they 're going to consider climate change in all all of their residential and business lending portfolios we don 't actually know what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where i said you know if a um a bank may decide that it might affect the loan asset ratio what 's the best coalition of councils that i 've seen i think um resilient south is probably the best one that i 've seen you know i think the ricky guys down in tasmania southern tasmania do some good work but you know it 's been a bit inconsistent of late but i think the best coalition where i 've seen you know organizations working together is probably yeah the resilient south example can you recommend any finance legal person in tasmania who does great finance speak and he 'll potentially present to councillors and executive teams yeah okay um i can recommend some finance i mean some legal people but they 're not in um they 're not in tasmania uh can you i um i take that one on notice helen because that 's a really good question um i 'll go through my diary and have it um i 'll have a look around and get back to you you know um in in um [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time and he flew down um to jesse to have a chat well uh unless there are any other questions i think that we we might wrap it up there and i 'll just uh thank you donovan uh for uh for presenting to about about all of this today i 've i really enjoyed this like bringing all of the the different content together that especially over the past five webinars that we 've that we 've been working on now in a fortnight 's time we are back into uh with a with a new speaker uh we have mark steven from seed consulting in south australia we 'll be talking about urban heat island management um obviously a major issue in in south australia but also in all over australia so just be having a look at different aspects of that um and if you have any um any questions we 'll be just i 'll be sending out some links and some follow-up from donovan 's talk so get in touch and give us your feedback about any of this thank you very much everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it please reach out and send me an email if you 've got any questions i 'm always happy to to have a conversation around these issues cheers all right thanks you,"(-20.4018362,

AUS,QLD,Whitsunday Regional Council,Whitsunday Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp2KXCWMXIgmDYxRg4lVpxg,WCCIH _ Webinar – Bec Enders and Amanda Blakney _ Case Study - Huon Valley Council,01driMBc5-0,20210106,2383.839,"Proserpine QLD 4800, Australia",5794,going to try and answer today and just some learnings and some of the challenges so just as a bit of an outline um give a little bit of background into the human valley council um and then talk a bit about the time frame that 's led to where we 're at now and we 're going to talk a little bit about the aspects of the leadership and planning that have led to that both rebecca myself we 're going to talk about different aspects of that some of the opportunities and grants and things like that that we 've been able to take advantage of and um yeah the bushfire situation comes up a lot um so we will talk a bit about that and how it fits into what we 're doing and we also uh for a long time have been a flood had flood plain flood prone areas as well so that 's something that we 're going to talk about too so human valley council so for those of you that don 't know we 're that shaded bit on the map at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the southern ocean so really big area nearly five and a half thousand square kilometers and um but only just over 17 000 residents so really big area a lot of that is actually world heritage area but even when you take that into account we don 't have a lot of residents um i think it was per hectare on the abs starter i can 't remember the number but um very rural still so lots of orchards and big history and forestry and um very diverse community so i was having a bit of a chat to ian before we got on before the webinar started and just talking about that history with um it 's very polarized and it 's still that way even though forestry is not as strong a lobbyist what it used to be but we still have a very diverse community with lots of strong views um which is probably one of one of the biggest challenges for us um particularly in the age of social media so we we can 't keep everyone happy all the time or maybe not any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah we try to get the best outcomes for everyone so the other thing i wanted to mention was that we have really diverse environments so i 've got a couple of pictures there where we 've got the cushion plant on the left which is sub-alpine vegetation and a lot of that vegetation is super sensitive to bush fire and soil moisture levels and then we 've also got coastal environments like that little tiny island there that 's um really diverse chocolate block full of orchids would you believe and that 's gonna go under with sea level rise so um just move on to the next one so in terms of um the time frame of how we got to where we are at the moment bit of turmoil turmoil in the council a few years back um before my time here um and so during 2017 and up to the council elected we had a commissioner in place and our general manager emilio started in that time so he started early 2017 and as general managers usually do he did a bit of a restructure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so he um excuse me um made sure that climate change was actually factored in back then and that that was written into my job um as it was being created the other thing that happened in 2017 was the council signed up to the city 's power partnership which is the climate council project basically supporting councils in pledging actions relating to energy efficiency mostly um and then once i 'd started we we also ran a community forum on climate change which was mainly focused on what mitigation actions they wanted to talk to us about uh i 'll just very quickly answer michael 's question so that you know now so he 's just said can you describe your role and title and how climate change fits in that so i 'm i 'm the manager of environmental services and i do have a number of units under me so i 've got environmental health nrm which natural resource management waste management compliance and climate change and climate change we try not to have it a attack on thing but it is a is sometimes but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nrm give planning advice environmental health and compliance are involved in enforcement activities that we we do so quite active in things like land clearing as well and so it 's sort of a separate unit but it that it also is relevant to those other units as all of you know climate change affects everything um so then we had the council started in 2018 in october and the bushfire event which ian mentioned um which was a big deal for new council um and then we had a look out motion so that 's local government association of tasmania relating to um our council wanting action to be taken on climate change and then we had our budget for the year we 're in now which actually involved support for developing a climate change strategy which was a which was a really big deal and also a few other things like um the purchase of our first electric vehicle for our fleet so i 've mentioned a little bit of this already um with emilio doing the restructure and making sure climate change was built into that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of behind the scenes stuff in preparation for having a council and making bigger decisions so things like researching electric vehicles and understanding how they work and that sort of stuff and also squirreling away money for solar panels and putting cases together so through that 2018 2017 it sort of looked like we weren 't doing much but there was a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes and they also had in mind that once the council came in there would probably be at least a portion of those elected reps that actually represented those people that were being very vocal on climate change in our community so the other thing that we 've been able to do even though we 're such a little regional council with not many resources take advantage of opportunities and grants so ricky is the regional climate change initiative which is the group of councils for southern tasmania and there 's been quite a few projects that we 've benefited from as being a part of that and working with other councils things like community profiles of emissions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always has climate change office which is state government so they 've um had programs that we 've been able to take advantage of for free as well things like um the fleet uh integration plans which was really helpful in us putting the case forward for getting our first electric vehicle and then also those projects i mentioned previously where they pay themselves back so there 's a really good case for them and they 're not just a big capital expense um outright so um on to the bushfire i get asked all the time are you doing stuff on climate change because of the bushfire so we the answer is no um so we were already on this path and we were already doing these other things what the bushfire did was really reinforce that this is actually real and this is happening and really brought home climate change as an issue because we that it wasn 't your everyday bushfire it was um a whole lot of hundreds of dry lightning strikes which is historically not happened in that part of tasmania and it combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushfire was it was definitely it was without a doubt climate change related so did bring that home but it 's not why we 're taking action on to beck hi everyone beckinder as mayor of the human valley i would just like to cover about that we live in a democracy leadership is paramount and that we are on a journey and i 'd like to talk just a little bit about the floods and the fires so so yeah we live in a democracy and i think it 's worthy of noting that councillors have a big impact in shaping communities and the decisions that mean we make or don 't make have a real impact on the future of people in place and we 're all very conscious of that here at the human valley council when the new council was elected in november of last year it delivered to the community eight out of nine new councillors so eight of those councils had never sat on a council before four females including the mayor and the deputy mayor five male councillors an age span of 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two councillors that actually had climate change as a key priority uh in their election campaign and this year we had a notice of motion put forward which amanda mentioned put forward by our youngest councillor councillor prince who requested climate change action and councillor prince had recently returned from the united nations youth climate change conference held in poland where there was an abundance of evidence-based reasons for council to take action on climate change now and that did have an influence many residents in our municipal area were lobbying for climate change and actually climate change emergency and councilwrist has received a petition on the 16th of may this year signed by 600 sorry 768 people asking council to declare climate change as an emergency asking us to develop a climate action plan together with our community and lobbying levels of government industry and businesses and seeking funding relating to climate action and the notice of motion for climate change action was supported by our councillors and in the latter stage it went to the local government association of tasmania to their agm and it was supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this area so we know from other councils in australia that have a climate change strategy in place that taking climate change action has resulted in an absolute overhaul of councils policies their procedures their guidelines procurement and investment practices and i think amanda alluded to before climate change affects everything it 's uh comes at a huge cost and a huge resource but it 's something that we we need to tackle as the chair of the regional climate change initiative program and the chair of the southern tasmanian council 's authority in southern tasmania my fellow mayors and i believe that strong collaboration and relationship building is paramount for good leadership and governance and we know that councils that work together across tasmania that share information and make an investment in scientific data our evidence uh that we 're better positioned to address climate change so as amanda highlighted the human valley council is on a journey and council officers were already working with member councils of the authority through the regional climate change initiative program and in more recent times as she mentioned uh we signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate council and council through climate change action is proceeding with two items that were identified on that petition that i mentioned to you earlier and specifically a climate action working group where membership is predominantly members external to council and that 's really important it includes up to eight community representatives and they 'll be responsible for looking at different industries and how they will be impacted by climate change they 'll be gathering feedback from businesses in the broader community they 'll act as the link between community and the council on the subject of climate change and providing feedback and making recommendations to our council about what needs to be included in the climate change strategy and they 'll be identifying education needs because i think amanda highlighted quite well before we we do have a bit of a split community on this and it 's probably right across australia where you have the people that absolutely are on board were on board you know 10 years ago with climate change and then you have the others which are finding it very difficult to face what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content that we get from this group to lobby government industry and business in a very targeted way using our own data sets for the human valley and these are required through our membership with the regional climate change initiative program anybody that is here from uh that is listening that 's from local government uh already know that local government is frequently the first port of call when citizens are concerned about matters that are legislated and regulated by federal and state governments they know they can get the year of their councillor but often not the year of a minister but in saying this though tasmania is unique in that our ministers are more accessible than what i have experienced on the mainland and this is a good thing for any counsellor or mayor in these circumstances where issues are of a global concern like climate change advocating and lobbying as a collective body in the form of an authority and local government association is the only way that we can really quantify the level of importance our communities place on the matter concern doing it individually as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority such as ours where we have 12 councils we can get a voice and we have more political potency amanda mentioned earlier about the regional climate change initiative projects that our council was involved in and how this research is informing our making at council in relation to regional development mitigation adaption and emergency management for example working with our southern member councils we have a better understanding now of the greenhouse gas emissions that our communities create at a regional level and at a municipal area level so this report enables us to cut and drill down on local energy use for industry commercial agriculture and forestry transport general residential renewable electricity generation and those motor vehicles out there that are aged etc so having this data helps us to have meaningful discussions with the higher users and to work with them and the broader community to continually reduce amanda alluded to you that we have flooding occurrences and unfortunately the flooding occurrences happen right in our major town and in 2000 july 2016 for example the flood heights were up to waist level and fortunately the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flood prone area the frequency of flooding has become greater since 1996 and we also have other rivers and creek which sort of filter in come from one direction flooding from one direction and the river floods from another it 's really unfortunate circumstance so in 2017 council commissioned a report to look at a levy option and uh designed to meet the 2100 climate flood event and out of the three levee options only one ended up being viable and that was 1 250 meters in length and so not only a very costly exercise but also something that would require a lot of community consultation and it 's pretty unsightly to be honest so we 're not sure where we 're going to go on that one earlier this year we had the river road bushfires which put many of our areas and people under threat it was one of many fires that were started as amanda mentioned by lightning strikes and the fires burned over 210 000 hectares over four municipal areas and so for us we operated an evacuation center that was open for 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an animal refuge going which had over 400 animals or the government agencies that we worked with it was 29 agencies in total um but they re-housed over 2000 people uh we 're fortunate we lost no lives um six structures were lost uh the impact on one of our major tourism attractions and the forestry industry was was devastating and of course that affects employment that affects economy and when all that happens then um you 're sort of heading for disaster for a while to be honest um it all comes at a terrible cost not only in asset wise but in in human cost so governance wise as well a recovery task force was established by the state government and recovery hubs were put in place in their actually in our affected townships and then also i was the chair of an affected area recovery committee which was managing half the issues were related to health and the other half these shows were related to building the economy back up again for those businesses that have been severely impacted disasters always come at a cost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires was four hundred and thirty thousand six hundred and fifteen dollars and uh most of that was actually related to operating the evacuation center so we still don 't know the total cost of businesses and our community but we do know that our many members in our community are still suffering so what have we learned volunteers need to be trained and registered for emergency response so we can increase the numbers to assist in an emergency volunteers and paid staff get exhausted due to prolonged periods of caring for others fatigue sustaining continued adrenaline and breathing in polluted air animals that are confined to smaller spaces pose a risk to biosecurity registration practices for people need to be tightened to get a true indication of the number evacuation centres are for brief overnight stays while alternative accommodation is found more much more education needs to be done with the community to prepare their properties and family for bushfires and a plan that needs to be put in place for the relocation of pets and animals economic loss and employment has a sustained impact on communities and timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are paramount and getting media to move shift their mindset from response stage to recovery stage can be challenging because media likes drama and particularly particularly when you 're trying to drive the economy activity after a bushfire and you do end up combating for quite some time media who want to keep you in that state of drama and fires the other really important thing to remember is people who suffer mental health issues or have existing mental health issues will take up to three to four years to recover after a serious bushfire so during the bushfires we were continually told that future weather patterns predict that tasmania will experience bushfires more frequently and for longer periods of time and when we think about the amount of resources we need on the ground during the response process over 15 days and that four out of 29 municipal areas were fire affected it really is concerning to think how we would manage if half of this state was on fire should a disaster occur on a catastrophic statewide scale then we know the department of premier and cabinet would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change is impacting us in so many ways it 's critical that we pull our resources together now and continually seek evidence that guides us to make key statewide decisions for the future of our state and that 's what i was saying we 're on a journey but it 's a journey we have to do together and pull our resources because it 's um it 's too big for one municipal area to manage thank you i can um answer that first question now from ian so um he 's just asked taking into account that the human community has a diversity of views about climate change will this be represented on the community stakeholder group being set up so um so that group is based on a deliberative democracy model um it is pared down a fair bit because we don 't have the resources to randomly select um members of our community and do that whole market research type expensive approach but it but we will be trying to identify people that are just ordinary everyday residents and members of our community that are vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a small group it won 't have ideally it won 't have really extreme views on it because it will just make it quite difficult for that group to work to um work through those issues but it will have um yeah a diversity of um people on it uh so what 's that next question um the next question from ian is considering that tasmania is looking at a future of more frequent intense disasters under climate change what do you think the next 10 years looks like from a policy emergency management governance perspective um yeah so yeah it 's that 's a very good question i might hand over to beck for that one look um of interest uh there was an inquiry as there often is into bush fires and there 's been several recommendations made by an independent inquiry into our bushfires one is is that there is uh better communication through a formal process so you could say through a policy or government governance process for all all stakeholders as amanda mentioned we do have forestry here so it 's not just government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be an emergency um center in place 24 7 manned by appropriate people um so that is that 's certainly something that 's not in place at the moment you could say and also the task force um the emergency task force that has been i think on two occasions now they are continually learning from their processes as well um there is there needs to be a more robust policy around even disaster funding um and that is being reviewed i understand as well at the moment does anyone have any more questions just jump in while that other person is is asking questions and i really encourage everybody to um to put in questions um now so i suppose one of the the things that i 'm curious about with with local government whenever we start talking about changes to frequency or intensity of disasters is changes to the national disaster relief um and recovery arrangements so nidra and how that will impact or whether that will impact uh the council uh under climate change scenarios so essentially what 's the financial position of the council to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change that you 've been talking about yes so we don 't have that in place and that is a major concern for us that at the moment with everyone and it 's the same with the don alley bushfire everyone 's been operating in that model where there 's relief funding provided and i know it was one of the first things i thought about when we when we had that big bushfire was this is this money is not going to keep flowing if we have more and more disasters so that 's something that yeah we have to think about and um do you have anything to add um yeah only only that um i i mean i agree with amanda we we know what the future the future is and we know that we 're going to have a lot more of these disasters and it does appear that um the the pull back from even at the task force level so when they wind up i 've i 've spoken to mayors that have been involved in significant disasters and they say that you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health support needs to be in place for four to five years uh and so if you think about um what the thing that concerns me to be honest is um if we have another fire between now and the next say the next three years um it 's not only the financial but it 's the it 's the human cost um we we have a lot of people that are still suffering and um yeah the local government doesn 't have the funds let 's just say and um and i can 't ever imagine local government being in the position where it actually has the funds it needs the support of federal and state government and but federal and state government need to realize that recovery is not just six months recovery is not 12 months it is four to five years um i suppose so so melissa 's just uh pointed out uh that that question related to to getting uh the council on board i suppose that this is one of those really special occasions where we do have a mayor online so um what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elected representatives on board related to climate change and that might come from the community or it might come generally to do with our audience from from the more corporate members of council do you have thoughts or feedback on that it 's definitely a a blend uh it yeah i mean your staff need to be in that frame anyway and i think have a have a thirst for building up their knowledge bank and based on evidence the staff need to think collaboratively and be relationship builders as well because it 's important that they are continually sharing information with each other as they as they are learning and bringing it to the attention of of others um staff do have influence um and you hope that uh the the council that they work in um you know helps them to be able to elevate that interest and um so that they can they can raise the the concerns um that they have with uh with the councillors um and councillors in turn as well um you know if they are fulfilling their role uh which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they need to be bringing back to the table whether that voice is we don 't believe in climate change or um we we want climate emergency so it 's um uh to be honest i think it 's it 's a whole set of skills that everybody requires and i know you 're not going to get that on every council i 've i 've been on the other side for eight years and and there are councillors which um are willing to listen and um and evaluate everything and be um object you know have be objective about this the information they receive um so i think it 's a combination of staff feeling that they are that they 're confident and that they are up to date with information and that they have an area of influence and the community making sure that the elect people that they elect in place other what people that are actually going to listen to them um and um elected members that are willing to work together and be open-minded and not be judgmental so hey that 's that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that going but i it 's not one single thing and um and i think this is where democracy um there there are advantages and and disadvantages i suppose of of democracy uh when it comes to boards and um but if you can have um board members uh or you know counsellors which um at least are um haven 't made their mind up and before they 've sat at the table that they 're they 're willing to have their mind changed is really important and and i 've seen that happen on this council i 've seen people come from different positions and be respectful and and listen to the evidence that 's put forward by the the um council officers and also the um their the other information that 's come to the table through the elected members i hope that i hope that sort of explains it i might just add in that um i don 't know i 'm not sure how much of it is due to it but i know when i write my reports to council for some of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which spells out that the council should be acting in the best interests of the community in terms of health and wellbeing as well and relating that to the impacts of climate change and the risks to the to the to the community from that so um yeah sometimes you know that kind of stuff can be ignored but um i think yeah if you 're having a go at getting it through the council then having like beck said all the evidence there and just it not being a motive or um based on one sector of the community or anything like that but just it 's spelling out why it 's in the best interests of the community as a whole and then um if they say no to it then that 's um yeah that 's up to them and that it 's not without having all that information presented to them and the other thing i was going to mention to that question is um that as a council officer being conscious of community ex expectations and balancing what resources the council does have so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen but when camp the council is ultimately having to make decisions based on what budget is there and what is within our power and so keeping it within that sphere of control for the most part is important as well so next question do you have any information or estimates on the cost of damage to council-managed infrastructure of the um january bushfires do you yeah um fortunately fortunately we didn 't have any damage to infrastructure um it was private properties and sustainable sustainable sustainable timbers um that actually had um the damage so forestry industry had significant damage and um otherwise a lot of our farmers lost fences etc and sheds so um yeah so fortunately for us on this occasion and i always say this occasion um it was it 's but our people have suffered so and that 's a huge cost yeah so probably what 's more relevant with that question in terms of council-managed infrastructure is the floods because we have a lot of little bridges over a lot of rivers and creeks and replacing bridges and or repairing bridges is really expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's that 's one of the biggest things so unless there are any other questions i think that we 're out of other questions and out of time to be honest um i might just thank um becky and amanda for for taking the time um to present to us today um lots of really valuable um information there that um really really interesting from my perspective so i hope everybody else feels the same uh just a quick plug for the um for the next webinar um in a fortnight 's time we have risk transparency with the city of marion so marion is based in south australia in adelaide and the city of marion is is really interesting in terms of the work that they 've done over the past few years related to climate change and specifically around the the sharing of information to do with with climate change and they now released a lot of information about what they 're doing to their community and and are really pushing those boundaries which in terms of the the topics that we focused uh into through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of people are bringing up the findings from the task force of financial disclosures um and discussing how important it is to share information and this is a council that has gone there and is is really sharing as much information as it possibly can um we 're trying out something new in terms of how we promote these these webinars and essentially we really want to support uh people who come along to um the the previous webinar coming along to the next one so if you sign up uh now or to the next before before the next webinar and you use the discount code marion that discounts it down to zero so you can actually come along to the next free one and the idea is that we 'll be doing that and trying to continue that on as long as possible to to share and build up the audience as we go so that we can share this with with new audiences so once again thank you everybody uh thank you amanda and beck and hopefully look forward to seeing you next uh next fortnight thank you very much,"(-20.4018362, 148.5832116)"

Management,ZIlm7eONQUo,20210106,2573.599,"Proserpine QLD 4800, Australia",7907,heat island management uh delivered by doctor mark steven druid so extreme heat impacts the the health and well-being of the community the environment and economic performance the accumulation of heat in urban areas can result in urban heat islands which experiences experience temperatures higher than the surrounding landscape under climate change obviously the the impact of higher temperatures will become more evident in these areas and is a really important aspect of managing climate change for local government so mark mark 's career spans nearly 20 years with public and private sector experience in planning engagement climate change water and national natural resource management he has 10 years experiencing experience in in consultancy including the past six years as co-director of seed consulting services um and we 're really excited for him uh to to talk about uh his his expertise from from this area um and hopefully everybody um has the opportunity to to gain something from this from this presentation so without further ado i might just hand it over to to mark who can um take it away mark wonderful uh thanks ian and thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about uh this topic urban heat islands and and how to manage them and it 's interesting for us uh this interest in urban heat island management really grew out of a lot of the climate change strategy work we 've been doing where um councils and communities in particular were looking at how do they tackle the emerging issues around extreme heat so on the one hand we 've got urban heat island management and on the other really where we 're headed is how do we grow cool cities and just before i kick off can i say thanks to ian as well and also donovan burton for inviting me to be part of this it 's a great process as mentioned as well this is part of i suppose work we do at seed around what we call livable cities so we 've we 've worked with around about uh 40 councils so far and these types of studies in wa sa victoria new south wales and queensland so it 's really a fascinating and exciting area so let 's uh get stuck into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an overview as to what we 'll be tackling so first thing i want to touch on is why does urban heat or cooling matter and then what causes urban heat island so there 's a lot of work being done uh and more and more around what are the driver 's urban heat islands that 's important to understand um well they want to look at specifically what 's the impact of different types of surface materials because they 're the sort of things that can be controlled or influenced by whether it be councils or business or construction firms so that 's worth taking a look at and what does it also mean for climate change often that 's a question we get asked and it 's important to to consider that because it 's not a straightforward question and then i 'll do a wrap-up by looking at five things that i think councils and businesses need to consider when they 're looking at how to manage the urban heat island effect so why does urban heat actually matter i 'm going to start off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this which is a bit of my own personal reflection so i live in adelaide and you know always dreaded long hot summers but this summer just gone by we had what was an extraordinary hot day 46.6 degrees it was just after 3 30 p.m on the 24th of january and it it 's interesting the psychology behind extreme heat so many people listening in might uh have similar experiences so in our case here once it gets over 35 degrees people tend to think well that 's a kids are coming home early from school but that 's manageable maybe a swim in the pool or down the beach we 'll resolve it once we get over 40 degrees you really start to say look it 's a day to spend time inside but you know once we hit 46 degrees i know as a i 've got three children and is that a dad you really start to think how do we avoid some really serious impacts on people so you 're looking out for children you 're looking out for elderly neighbours or relatives so extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a whole different perspective and so understanding the intersection between extreme heat and heat islands to my mind is becoming increasingly uh important in our cities particularly as climate changes driving more extreme heat so a little bit of a recap as to why heat islands are important so heat islands are really part of cities that accumulate heat than other to a greater degree than other parts of the landscape a lot of the work early around heat islands come out of the u.s and they 'll distinguish in between what happens in cities and rural areas where cities are really accumulating heat to a much greater degree but extreme heat itself it 's not often known that it as a natural hazard it causes greater mortality than any other natural hazard so when we compare it to floods or even fire extreme heat does ultimately kill more people but also significant economic impacts and if you 're interested there 's a really fascinating paper in nature which really has some results that suggests up to 10 of the gdp of cities could be spent on managing urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the century some some really significant impacts and obviously as we get climate change occurring we get more extreme heat the way extreme heat is experienced will be much much worse in urban heat islands those urban heat islands being parts of the landscape that accumulating heat to a much greater degree been getting prepared for this talk i thought you know how does it compare to other types of natural hazards and so i looked at fire and i thought well you know fire as an example we map it regularly quite often we make sure that houses are built in a certain way to avoid fire councils even have powers to enforce clean up of say for example fuel loads so that we reduce fire risk so we 're really all over fire even from a flood perspective i think we manage we map flood plains regularly we 'll even build some pretty major infrastructure to mitigate the risk of flood but i really don 't think we 're anywhere near as far progress and how we manage extreme heat and then also urban heat islands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so what i 'm going to explore a little bit more as we go along is how do we identify heat islands what drives them and you know what do we do about it a couple of important uh just technical differences to pick up on so there are lots of different ways to look at how we describe and ultimately measure heat so one of the ones that we talk about is surface temperature so that 's literally if you were to bend down and touch the ground what 's the temperature of the ground surface so if you 're looking at bitumen for example on the left hand side of the slide or the top of the tree or the top of grass the surface temperatures what we 'd feel if we put our hand on it now that 's quite different than air temperatures air temperature is typically measured at about 1.2 to 1.5 meters above the ground so they 're both measurements of temperature they 're just two different types of measurements the other one that i often gets talked about is thermal comfort now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation so it 's worth touching on these because once you get to once you start talking about heat islands and extreme heat these terms get thrown around quite a lot but from i think a council perspective it 's important to reflect on this statement here which comes out of a paper by norton at all and it says that while land surface temperature and air temperature are different ultimately addressing high surface temperatures in cities is an appropriate target so this is really useful to know if you 're a council for example looking at what you can do to manage urban heat islands it says that managing land surface temperature and indeed understanding it is a good place to start which is certainly where we focus a lot of our work so i suppose the question is how do you actually go out and measure heat turns out there are there are a number of different ways so one of them is virus satellites so there are very satellites orbiting the planet some of them have thermal cameras and you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 to get thermal images those images are free but they do require processing and you tend to get pixel size somewhere between 30 and 100 meters by 30 to 100 meters so they 're quite large alternately you 'll see i 've got a picture down the bottom here this is from a piece of work we did where we 've done a flyover of adelaide through a couple of studies the advantage of the flyover is that you get the pixels of the thermal camera come out to about two meters by two meters so it 's a much finer resolution and it gives you a lot more insight into what 's happening on the ground um another approach again though and you 'll see we 've got a picture here of a drone that we 've used for some council work and here 's a picture of the results of that sort of imagery you can get down to thermal pixels there of about two centimeters or a couple of centimeters so you know when we 're looking at how do we measure heat a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers is the choice is how much money have you got to spend on collecting the data but also what 's the resolution of the imagery that you want and the the greater the resolution the greater your ability to understand what 's actually driving heat and just down the bottom right here we 've got a picture of justin vandenberg who we work with he 's out there with a thermal comfort measuring device as well which can be deployed in the field so bottom line is lots of different ways to measure heat one of the things we 'll often talk about is hot spots versus heat islands and there 's lots of terminology that gets thrown around in this whole heat heat space so hot spots tend to be at a scale of a couple of meters so you 'll recall i mentioned around aircraft if we 're using aircraft we might get say two meter by two meter resolution information we might look at a hot spot of that scale whereas heat islands tend to be at a much larger scale somewhere in the order 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment because i remember that one of the things i need to do at the start was let you know how to ask questions if you do have any questions i think what we 'll do is just to submit them as we go along and then i 'll work my way through them at the end of the presentation so you 'll see there 's the chat room option there or type the message if you do have any questions please drop them in there and then i 'll look to answer them once we get to the end so just coming back to hot spots versus heat islands are two very different things two different concepts and they end up delivering different maps so you 'll see there 's a map here on the the left this is from a publicly released report which is done for the east in the northern adelaide region the one on the left is based on two meter by two meter data so it 's much much finer resolution so that 's effectively hot spots whereas the one on the right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one on the right is a heat island map and so you 'll actually see that they are um at a much larger scale they 're those 250 by 250 meter cells and so we 're looking at urban heat islands there so it 's basically different resolution imagery so an important difference though all the same so moving along then so we 've under talked a little bit about why extreme heat 's a problem and the fact that we tend to look at land surface temperature as a way to understand urban heat islands i suppose a really important question that a lot of councils ask us is well what 's the actual impact of different land surface types on temperature this is an area where there 's more and more research being done this information here is once again out of a report which is a publicly available there 's a couple of different versions of this graft on the left but what it 's basically doing is it 's looking at different features of the landscape and trying to understand what their temperature is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature and really some of the key messages that come out of here for example is that bare ground or dry grass can actually be quite hot and well above regional average temperatures whereas things like trees or tree canopy and also irrigated grass can be have temperatures much below regional averages one of the things that often interests people about a graph like this is it does provide information on the surface temperature of roads which are hot both during the day time and the night time whereas we also have on the further to the right here and i 'll get onto this in a moment artificial turf for example we often find that that can have the highest average temperatures in the landscape that 's the highest average surface temperature just a little bit of background this sort of data here is collected by going back into those really detailed data sets and sampling it can be hundreds of points to generate what 's an average temperature for these lane surface materials so there 's a couple of different versions of these graphs that are around another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot off the press for a piece of work we 're doing for horticulture innovation australia we 're looking there at the heat mitigation benefits of living turf so that 's grass that 's been actively irrigated in most cases and so what we did was try and understand what 's the cooling benefits of irrigated turf as opposed to other examples of land surface types and some really interesting results here so we looked at data available in adelaide melbourne and sydney and generated this here so this slide is a summary across those three capital cities and what it tells us is that on average across those three capital cities irrigated turf tends to be up to uh not quite but up to five degrees cooler than the average surface temperature non-irrigated turf depending on exactly where you 're located can either be slightly cooler or slightly warmer we tend to find in the southern states particularly melbourne and adelaide where we 've got hot dry summers once the grass dries out it becomes more of a hot spot whereas when you 're somewhere like sydney or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can still see those areas green so they will be slightly cooler but then as we work half way through to the left we 've got information for example on synthetic turf which might be short pile which is often the type of turf artificial turf you 'll see in a cricket pitch we 've got bitumen there at nearly 4.8 degrees above the regional averages and then synthetic turf what we 've referred to as long pile it 's typically what you find on a hockey pitch or a soccer pitch has an average surface temperature of nearly 11 degrees above the regional average and interestingly just this past summer when we went out and did some spot measurements as well of the synthetic turf long pile we had some temperatures exceeding 70 degrees so that 's above 7-0 above 70 degrees so really quite quite significant so let 's uh keep moving along one of the things that you can do as well once you 've got detailed data sets is start to put together case studies this is from a publicly available western adelaide heat mapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these finer grain results is start to relate particular land surface types or features of the landscape with temperatures you 'll see here for example we 've got a sporting complex which is called santos stadium we 've got irrigated green space in the middle the blue means it 's cooler whereas the red on the outside is actually the that red material that you see on athletic stadiums typically it 's made up of some form of rubber crumb that tends to be much much hotter than the surrounding areas you 'll also see here we 've effectively got house roofs and the house roofs are showing up as red they 're much higher than average temperatures in this area whereas the blue is tends to be backyards in this case here most likely irrigated grass in those areas or it could be trees so really the point of showing this is to say that it can be really useful once you 've got a good data set to dive back into it and start to develop these case studies to really explore what 's driving urban heat islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also important to consider where should heat mitigation activities occur and this is a great uh little venn diagram here by norton at all what it does is it says we need to understand more than just heat exposure so everything i 've shown you until now is really about where does heat exist in the landscape whereas what norton says is we really need to understand the intersection between heat exposure where vulnerable members of the community exist and even potentially behavioural exposures so where are people actually outdoors and exposed to heat and a great example for me is lawn bowls clubs you might think if you had a lawn bowls club where it 's had artificial turf put in place which is certainly the case in many councils around the country now because it 's perceived as having low maintenance you 've got high heat exposure we 've got vulnerable members of the community because we 'll often have people aged over 65 in those areas and behavioral exposure is high because they 're actually out in the sum in that environment so this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prioritize our efforts we can also then use this question around where the intersection between urban heat and social vulnerability to generate maps like we see on the left hand side there once again this is from publicly available report for western adelaide and it might be a little bit hard to pick up depending on how far you 've got zoomed in this map but the darker blue areas are showing areas where we not only have high heat issues but we 've all got also got high vulnerability communities so doing these types of overlaps a really useful way to look at where are your potentially high priority communities and i 've got to say i 'm constantly amazed at the number of aged care facilities that are located in urban heat islands and i think what tends to happen is those facilities are often more dense housing and particularly if they 're new they are set up in areas where they don 't have they don 't have street trees they 're very very small gardens they might even have low maintenance gardens which have a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to find that some of these aged care facilities really are a bit of a nightmare combination of materials and really are putting elderly people in not a very ideal location at all from an extreme heat perspective so moving along the next topic is uh climate change and i didn 't want to spend too long on this but it 's absolutely worth touching on so you know what do we know about climate change and what it will mean for urban heat islands well the first thing is absolutely widespread warming is going to occur of all all the surfaces uh in a landscape and that will change the number and size of urban heat island so we will expect to see some changes and also we know is that as we get more extreme heat events or heat waves the experience of living in those existing heat islands is going to be a whole lot worse but i think to me one of the interesting and emerging areas for discussion around the impact of climate change in urban heat islands is what does it mean for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city or in a town are going to be impacted equally by climate change and the big one that jumps out for me and it relates back to the need for water sensitive cities and understanding actually what 's happening with grass so we have large areas of not irrigated grass if we 're finding that if you 're in a city or a town where climate change is going to drive out drier and hotter conditions we 're going to find that without irrigation there is a much greater risk of getting large areas of dry grass or even bare ground and that will therefore drive out greater expansion of urban heat islands the flip side is of course also important here so if we have areas where we 've got irrigated turf then they could in fact contribute to creating cool islands or cooling down a city but really when i look at climate change understanding how we 're putting water in the landscape and irrigating and maintaining green open space is going to become a super important into the future and really means that we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and urban heat island mitigation strategies as part of one process in my view other thing i wanted to move on briefly to is development so um you know we 're looking at what 's going to happen to urban heat islands in the future climate change is one consideration but development is another one and um there 's some case study work that we did in south australia for example that looks at low density versus medium density versus high density and then looks at the difference in the surface temperatures between those areas and what we find is surface temperature on average is going up as we 're moving from low to high density and typically it 's probably fairly obvious what 's going on there that 's been driven by the move to less permeable space so less green open space and an increase in the area that is hard surfaces such as roofs particularly dark colored roofs and also roads so development is one of those things that really can have a significant impact on the spread of urban heat islands one of the tools that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic for helping to look into this is the crc for water sensitive cities has developed its scenario tool what this lets you do is to train up your council area or parts of the council might be a suburb or a precinct into the tool and do an assessment of the current distribution of hot spots or heat islands but you can then run a series of scenarios so you could run scenarios that might be greening scenarios to the benefit of putting in more trees but you can also run scenarios on what happens if you transition low density housing areas to medium and high density and to me that 's a bit of a game changer because what it means is we can start to really probe into the impacts of our development decisions on the urban heat island and that will generate this type of image here whereby we have on the left an example of a small park this is one in south australia and where we 've trained up part of the landscape to have a different surface material here and ultimately drives out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needless to say it 's a great tool for looking at that um so how can we better manage urban heat we 're getting sort of the tail end of the the presentation uh here to me it 's really important to have a solid framework for doing this and one of those frameworks is this one here which is looking at what the factors are that influence vulnerability to extreme heat and it 's out of a report by lofton and anyone who 's interested in taking a look at that let me know and i can send out the the reference but what it does is it looks at what are the factors that contribute to heat exposure heat sensitivity and adaptive capacity it provides a really nice framework to start to look at where you can act there 's a really important question here as well which is where can government or business influence or control these factors so it may be that in some cases councils might want to control some of these factors or it might say our role is really to influence what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break down those roles across these areas but just as a quick wander through some examples of initiatives that are out there and sorry these highlighted yellow sections are really some of the ones that i think councils can take a bit more of a look at so how do you manage strenuous outdoor activity that might be by putting time frames on when people working outdoors can be doing that we might look at land use or urban design how councils can influence that how you support people as socially isolated or homeless and also potentially role councils and generating heat health plans so at a higher level there 's a range of examples there of actions that can be taken just some more specific examples now i think city parramatta has got a brilliant website which is supporting capacity building community engagement it 's called call parramatta it 's definitely worth having a look at if reaching out to the community something you 're interested in as part of your heat mitigation work the next thing is absolutely targeting drivers of urban heat and it kind of alluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some surface types that exist in the landscape that have a massive impact in urban heat islands synthetic turf is one of them and also soft fall rubber in playgrounds is another one that even though it might have nice colors it really tends to heat up quite a lot so understanding where they exist and whether they 're appropriate to be used particularly in this case here playgrounds is definitely worth considering and that can come out through things like an urban design framework i referred to this one here earlier on but i think one of the tasks really is looking at how you prioritize heat mitigation and particularly understanding what are the locations in any given council area that sit right at the intersection here and i 've already mentioned lawn bowls clubs might be one of them but i also think that aged care facilities are certainly another one where you can get a a map of your heat islands and then overlay that with the location of your aged care facilities it 's a really straightforward thing to do but also very powerful for decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this earlier on but it 's having an urban design framework so this is where you can really start to get very specific around what your expectations are for people who are doing development and construction in your council area so also this can be really important supporting the implementation of development plans another one is field trials there 's a number of councils now who have gone beyond looking at landscape scale urban heat islands and really trialling different surface materials the one on the left there is what 's called cool seal it 's a reflective road sealant that 's been used i know of two councils in south australia who 've done it it 's actually a product that was developed in california and has been applied to roads over there and it can reduce the surface temperature roads to um up to whether the manufacturers claim somewhere between 6 and 16 degrees below the average surface temperature for a region so it really can be quite powerful but needless to say field trial is a good thing to to look at particularly to develop the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's cool cities initiative uh or call roof initiatives so what they 've done here is they 've looked at engaging um people looking at doing volunteer work to paint rooftops it 's a little bit easier i think in new york because they 've got some flat roofs but needless to say it 's quite a creative way to engage the community and also get some really positive outcomes there for looking at energy saves on rooftops so that 's something if you type up new york city call roofs initiative you 'll be able to find the link to their website they 've actually got some good information on how they 've developed that initiative next one is i think it 's always important here to understand your baseline data and so you can start to measure future change there are various ways of doing this i mentioned before you can use satellite imagery which is free to acquire just requires some processing or you can get down to much more detailed data sets and it 's worthwhile unpacking the pros and cons of that but ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important understanding how your urban heat islands are contracting or expanding so just to come down now to the summary we 've obviously covered quite a bit of territory but i thought i 'd just wrap up and saying and this question we get asked quite often is what are the five things to consider uh when preparing an urban heat mitigation or urban calling strategy i think the first one is really to answer this question where are heat islands so where do they exist within your council area uh or your area of interest and what 's causing them so you know particularly what are the land surface materials are causing heat islands and then secondly that question of where are heat vulnerable communities located it 's also important there with the vulnerable communities is to ask yourself the question are you looking at for example children around the age of four is it elderly people over 65 years is it people with a disability there 's lots of different ways to frame vulnerable members of the community but needs to say knowing where they live in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do heat islands change through time and what do we think the impacts of development or climate change might be because really the decisions we 're making today are influencing how heat islands will exist in the future the fourth point there is really working out where can government or business influence or control factors that influence heat vulnerability so there might be a whole bunch of actions that are out outside of your control so really trying to work out where are the areas that you can have an impact and point five i think i 've just covered on that before but it 's saying really what are the decisions that are being made today that are influencing heat islands now and in the future and my guess is that particularly metropolitan parts of australia there aren 't too many councils who wouldn 't be making development decisions right now that aren 't in some way exacerbating heat islands that 's certainly been our experience so they 're the five things uh to consider so um that is that 's a wrap um thank you for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to uh present on urban heat island management and it 's over to any questions so look to air now to facilitate some of the the questions yeah so in terms first questions coming up is in terms of australian councils who would i think are some of the real leaders in this space um i think the it 's interesting they 're leaders in different ways as well so i think some of the the south australian and the melbourne councils are doing a brilliant job at mapping urban heat islands i think city of parramatta in new south wales has done some brilliant work not just at mapping heat islands but also doing some of that community engagement and extension work in fact right across western sydney we can see good examples of where councils are working in this space and they 've developed strategies around what are the types of actions that can be taken to cool their city down so i think we 're seeing good examples i 'm not familiar as to whether there are i know actually there are some councils of western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be some heat mapping soon to happen in uh queensland so that 's exciting also so just wait to see whether any other questions start to come through so the next question is the infrastructure asset portfolio of many councils is about roads management have you gotten examples of councils managing this from both the uhi and cost perspective that take in to account climate implications that 's a great question i think i 've got a personal view that roads and particularly streetscapes are going to become a hotly contested space particularly in cities where we 've got significant amounts of development happening we 're going to be losing our green open space whether it 's in the public room or the private realm so street skates are becoming uh really quite important um with regards to streetscapes i 've mentioned before examples like cool cities sorry of cool seal i think that 's an interesting product to be able to look at but also looking at traditional forms of road sealant and how do they how do they influence the temperature so whether we 're looking at great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of road sealant also one of the things with the cool cool seal product is that it 's claimed that it increases the lifespan of the road surface and so you get into some quite interesting cost benefits there is that you 've got benefits around cooling but it also does increase the lifespan of the road surface so it can be quite um it 's quite a lot to unpack there another question here is do you have any examples of any cities doing this well we are monitoring temperature and heat but the next steps are what we can do to reduce reduce the heat i know that we 're doing some work with city of kinks at the moment who are actively looking at developing a cooling strategy i 'd again say that i think parramatta 's done some good work and they 're probably a good example of a council who has gone from doing the the mapping of urban heat into looking at what are the specific actions that can be um can be taken there 's also a couple of examples i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being involved in region-wide heat mapping into now trialling specific uh treatments for their council area also city of salisbury is doing some of that as well just looking at another question that 's come through have any state governments included this matter into state policy to inform local councils to do work in this space and their planning and design parameters or is it up to each local council to volunteer this type of program that 's a great question i think we 're at a really interesting point here where we 've got increasing awareness about the existence of heat islands and the impacts they have on impacts they have on health i don 't think we 're at a point there where we 're getting perhaps a stronger direction as is needed and i refer back to those examples before around looking at flood hazard data and also fire hazard data well i think we 'd probably agree that there 's lots of good examples of where state and local government are providing really strong and clear direction on how we manage those hazards whereas extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eight ball there so there 's more work to be done and in many cases it is my observation would be that it 's being led by local councils certainly state governments are looking at how they get involved in coordinating the acquisition of heat island data which is really important and can also be quite expensive particularly if you 're looking getting that through fixed-wing aircraft you know there are some significant costs there but i don 't necessarily see strong consistent policy direction at a state government level at a national national level another question is do you know funding streams in this space i think one of the emerging areas here will be around national disaster risks resilience and recovery and emergency management dollars i don 't think it 's there quite yet but we know that extreme heat is widely recognised around the country as a major driver for emergency services and call-outs particularly during summer and so i expect that 's an area where we 're going to see increasing interest often i what i observe happening is councils are supporting or funding this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be looking at getting matching grant funding from various uh state agencies and other programs so there 's not necessarily particularly a federal level i wouldn 't say that i can see any clear and obvious funding streams you can see we 've got another question starting to come through i 'll just wait for that one to pop up in terms of getting a successful urban heat island project in council which roles typically need to be involved yeah i think often what seems to happen in my observation is that it 's driven by sustainability and environment professionals and often that 's been the case because the awareness of the need to work on this has come out of climate change related work or climate change strategy works so doing some urban heat island mapping comes out of off the back of those climate change strategies but what i think is quickly realized is that many the the actions that need to be taken to address urban heat islands actually sit outside those environment and sustainability areas so for example i 'd be actively seeking the input of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're particularly for example roads roads play a big role in influencing the existence of urban head islands i 'll be looking at parks and gardens teams particularly because they 're at that practical coal face of how to manage the urban forest and also keeping open space green also statutory planners who 've got a an eye on development plans and you know what 's actually in the development plan for a given council and is it either helping to manage urban heat islands or is it making them worse so yeah what it 's great question while originally some of this has been driven by environmental sustainability professionals i think ultimately there are a really broad range of roles or functions within council who need to be ultimately engaged i think one of the other things there as well is that you know when we 're looking at getting the engineering side of things involved often there can be you know slightly bigger budgets looking at doing projects and an interest in the technology as well that 's used to be able to map and identify urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emerging space where do you see it going in the next five to ten years i can see that the question around how do different development patterns influence urban heat i think that 's going to become particularly important i mentioned before the crc for water sensitive cds it 's got a great tool there the the land surface temperature scenario tool we 've just started using that and i can see that that is going to become very commonplace in that every time a a precinct upgrade is looked at or new zones are developed will start to run out multiple scenarios to better understand you know what is the impact of different development decisions because at the moment i think many people would be aware that development decisions are being made that could make the urban head island worse but we don 't always have the evidence base for um for i suppose providing that information back to development planners for example so tools like that will become increasingly important and then being able to explain the business case around this so how does uh extreme heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or actually health costs for the community do solar panels on rooftops contribute to urban heat islands that is an excellent question our initial observation is that they don 't we haven 't done a detailed study on this one and i think it 's something that 's worthwhile looking more into so while they 're dark in color they also tend to reflect quite a lot of light because of the glass on top so that 's something that does require a bit more investigation i think particularly so we see the way that solar panels incorporate it into roofs that 's going to become a big factor i touched very briefly on on roofs but they really are an important part of what drives urban heat islands so for example we know that dark colored roofs that are made out of tiles concrete tiles they really do tend to absorb quite a lot of heat and where we 've got and particularly aged care facilities i 've seen examples of where they 'll have dark colored roofs because that 's what 's considered from a design perspective to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite hot areas just purely through the choice of rooftop whereas an alternate choice of roof type which might be lighter color or more reflective surface could really actually go the other way and start to create cooler spots in the landscape so but yeah great question around solar panels and i think it 's something that definitely requires further work uh well thanks mark uh that 's all the time that we have for for today so we so we might just wrap it up there and as you can see mark 's contact details are on that final slide and i encourage you to to note them down and give them a call or send them an email if you 've got any further questions uh next week we 've got um next fortnight we have uh our case study from new society council and we have the mayor tony wellington and the adaptation climate change officer uh grant hinna who will be doing their presentation about uh where the where the council is currently sitting in terms of climate change and that includes their work on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participating councils have have worked on uh but also just how they 've approached it from a bit of a way of how they 've got the the corporate and the elected bodies um working in the in the same same direction which is one of the challenges that we that we see uh quite quite frequently in terms of in terms of local government so thank you once again to mark and everybody who 's come along to today 's webinar on urban heat island management um and i hope to see you all again in a fortnight 's time thank you very much bye you,"(-20.4018362, 148.5832116)"

Council,kCRGLm-7zlo,20210106,2709.44,"Proserpine QLD 4800, Australia",7318,okay where we will be um having a webinar delivered by tony wellington and grant hinno from uh from nurseshire council for those that are joining the the climate change innovation lab for the first time welcome and for those that are regular participants welcome back um this is the just as a bit of background for those that are joining us for the first time the climate change innovation lab um is essentially uh set up to to bring together local government councils community members academics and to look at climate change specifically uh we 're we 're focused on climate change adaptation and we have a particular interest in uh the adaptation of the local government as part of that work we 're running a fortnightly webinar series uh specifically for um local government and and trying to bring councils together to to talk about climate change from a range of different perspectives this is the seventh webinar in our in our series where we try and match it up uh go between different different topics as well as doing deep dives into into councils so we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on the legal aspects the financial aspects a bit on community engagement but we 've also just focused a little bit on local government so today we are um going in and focusing on the the climate change journey of of new south shore council and and really thinking about how nusa sees climate change as an issue for the council and community examples of what they are doing to manage and adapt to these challenges and what examples of what they 've found to be the most consistently challenging um aspects of it as well as the solutions that they 've tested along the way and the webinar will be delivered by uh tony who 's the tony wellington who 's the mayor of the of the council and grant hinna who 's the uh climate adaptation officer at the council so we 're really pleased that um this is one of those situations which is pretty special for us where we have this and we actually have an opportunity to to explore some of those links between the corporate and the elected in the council and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might just hand it over and my understanding is that tony um is going to be doing the first part of the presentation and then he 'll hand it over to to grant and then at the end we 'll do q a so without further ado tony take it away thanks ian and hello everyone um you can submit questions anytime ian tells me by text but we 'll uh answer the questions when we get to the end of the presentation so um i 'm going to talk about uh a bit about noosa council a shy description bit about the geography and the political decisions and then i 'll hand over to uh grant to talk about the nuts and bolts um so we 're starting on the nusr emblem and the logo just out of curiosity uh represents boroniakesia which is an endangered native shrub that was found by one of our key local environmental activists and here we go so rather than look at me i 've got some pretty pictures for you today um the nusa council vision statement is different by nature the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got 55 000 residents so news is known for being a key tourist destination i 'm sure you 're all aware it 's got a reputation for environmental excellence and low-key human development over the years we 've kept building heights to a very low level play strict controls on public signage avoided big city symbols like traffic lights and that sort of thing and generally tried to keep a village field of the place and as i say modern noosa is built on the foundations of environmental activism that began back in the 1960s most particularly with battles to protect the nusa headland and the kalula sand mass from development here 's a picture of our headland which today is the uh one of the most visited national parks in certainly the most visited in queensland one of the most visited in australia so if you look down at noosa from the top of noosa hill which is on the edge of that headland you see that quite a bit of the shire is uh low-lying uh we 've got canal estates and a lot of development along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that along our coastal strip from noosa heads down to parisian at the southern end of the shire and this is a view looking north along that strip you 'll see that there 's not much development at all and that 's largely a product of local environmental activists who successfully fought off development pressure over the over many decades along the coast so the good fortune also is that along a lot of that coastal strip as we 'll see in a second when the image comes up there 's a bit of a buffer between the residences and the ocean at the bottom there is our parisian digital hub then some residential housing and you 'll see that the frontal dunes have largely been kept intact so just to summarize council 's response to climate change over the last few years in 2016 we established missions reduction policy and that committed council to taking action to reduce carbon emissions and then in the same year we endorsed a zero emissions organizational strategy and that commits council to achieving zero net emissions by 2026. um zero emissions new so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing acronym of zen and as soon as council uh set its ambitious goal the community galvanized and established a collective of groups uh including a new not-for-profit organization to aim for zero emissions by the entire community by 2026. so council 's goal is for the council itself and the communities jumped on board and said we 're going to match that so we used beyond zero emissions to provide an initial audit of council 's emissions and then we use drm energy to perform a level two energy audit of our highest electricity consuming buildings and and facilities and obviously that works essential as we beaver away at our zero emissions objective so that we can actually trace our progress along the path so in 2017 we began work on a climate change adaptation plan and that 's supported by a coastal hazards adaptation plan we were one of the first queensland councils to receive funding through the queensland government 's q coast 2100 program and that helps fund the work on the coastal hazards adaptation plan or chat and that chat now is nearing completion we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chat should be completed by the end of the year and the climate change adaptation plan will be endorsed in the new year and and of course during this time we also like douglas who i think sitting in here today uh became one of the founding members of the climate council cities power partnership uh so council currently has a full-time carbon reduction project officer uh plus a full-time climate change adaptation coordinator and that 's grant hinner who you 'll be hearing from my in a moment and we 've set up various internal working groups and in order to meet our targets we 're doing all the things you would expect installing solar changing lighting to led improving efficiency of air conditioning systems changing staff behavior etc but certainly what we found out early in the piece is that almost 60 percent of council emission emissions derive from landfill so we 're constantly trying to improve our methane capture we 're also doing our best to divert organic material from landfill we introduced a compulsory garden waste bin service that in other words we 've now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and we 've got a full-time waste education officer but we 've got a very close eye on the methane we haven 't got quite enough capture to be able to convert to electricity yet but we 're hoping that will happen soon and now in order to meet our targets we 've also got a noosa plan the new planning scheme is just been out for consultation that is the draft we 've just completed that and of course the scheme has to reflect uh the new flood and climate change mapping and it also has to mesh with the coastal hazards adaptation plan that we 're doing at the same time we 've also prepared a detailed coastal hazard mapping for areas affected by storm tide inundation sea level rise and coastal erosion and these are mapped for the years 2040 2070 and 2100 most recently noosa council was the first queensland council to declare a climate emergency in that of course we joined various other councils around the nation plus the ict government who 've already made that declaration that 's almost it for me but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that we did recently we do a biennial community satisfaction survey and we 've added some extra questions this year and one of them was we asked if they understood climate change and what it means uh 400 residents were responded they were randomly selected 38 claimed have a very good understanding and 41 said they understand climate change reasonably well just 2 admitted they had no idea to me this suggests that the residents are either extremely well educated in climate change or else they 've got a somewhat inflated view of their own understanding of the complex topic of climate change and i think the latter 's a bit more likely when asked about the level of risk posed by beach erosion flooding and storm tide around half of all respondents believe that these are either a high or extreme risk for nusashire over the next couple of years over the next couple of decades i should say so that does it for me for the opening and i 'll now hand to our real expert grant hinna to take you on to the rest of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top there we have our emissions reduction policy which was endorsed in 2016 and to support that in 2017 council endorsed a climate change response policy and the reason we developed that was because we recognized there was a little bit of a gap in setting out officially why council felt it needed to take strong action on climate change um that policy also clearly identifies a source of truth from a scientific perspective so for example if the ipcc or the csiro publish new projections that are materially different to what we 're currently basing our adaptation program on um that that is a trigger for council to initiate a management response review it 's also very clear around how we will be transparent around natural hazards information and risks as well as discharging our duty of care to the community on this journey so far we 've participated in the queensland climate resilient councils initiative which i believe donovan burton has presented a webinar already so for those of you who don 't know through that initiative you can pick from several different topics and have have experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive team and so we picked infrastructure finance and legal as part of that we also underwent a governor 's readiness assessment and you can see some of the results there at the bottom as well as a staff survey was undertaken to get an understanding of how capable staff feel um they are with regard to embedding responses to climate change appropriately within their particular areas so you can see along the bottom our score puts us in a reasonably good position at the time this was done we had no response in our asset management team but we started to rectify some of that and since we 're still going through some of the foundational aspects of our adaptation program it 's understandable that our financial management score was a zero and still is a zero that really is probably the last piece of that puzzle so just give you a quick overview of some of those survey results um the bottom half is encouraging it shows that our staff felt that um uh climate change as an issue should be taken seriously and is being taken seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to indicate um similar to what tony was saying before about our community a little bit of overconfidence in the ability to understand what the climate science means from a risk perspective for nusa um just anecdotally discussing with the topic with staff it 's quite clear that very quickly a lot of people think climate change is just sea level rise um and that top pie chart on the right is very interesting um with uh 28 claiming that climate change risk assessments are used in their department when um we 're still currently doing our first climate change risk assessment so that was a interesting result um this next one i think is more reflective of the reality so i won 't run through all those headings on the left but essentially the message coming from that is staff understand it 's important but they don 't currently feel like they have the information or systems or processes in place to allow them to embed it appropriately in their day-to-day roles but on the right very encouragingly was um the message from staff was that they felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way down so the mayor and the other councillors as well as the executive team uh right behind what we 're doing in fact they they push us quite a bit um so that was that 's very very encouraging and i believe we 're told by donovan at the time that 's not normally the case so um i certainly get to i 'm very fortunate to benefit from that support from the top and i 'm not just saying that because tony 's sitting right there yes you are so we 're at the moment as tony mentioned we 'll be doing participating in the qcos 2100 program that means developing a coastal hazards adaptation strategy or a plan as we like to call it and the reason we 're doing that now and see it as probably one of the most critical things we could be doing is because as some of you may have seen over in western australia they 've had some serious coastal erosion events and the councils there under immense pressure now do you undertake reactionary action to protect private assets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions in for when certain events occur that helps us as a council from a financial perspective from a legal perspective from an operational perspective infrastructure planning design that kind of thing and it 's also important in that it sends a very strong well-informed signal to our external stakeholders whether they are our infrastructure partners or the community or local businesses or what have you um i won 't go too much into the modeling today but the modelling results were largely as expected we 've got a lot of development along a river and a long beachfront so there 's quite a lot of assets exposed there um the stakeholder response has been mixed um as expected there 's some people that are really really behind what we 're doing and the message we 've got is that 's the vast majority of our community and those who sort of have a bit of an issue um tend to fall into two camps it 's a very small denier camp um which is to be expected and then there 's been quite a strong response from those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently working through that at the moment and that 's one of the lessons we 've learned along the way is that that engagement with the groups that you expected to be expected to be the most severely impacted directly by climate change is really really important so as we move through the pointing out of our project we 're doing a lot more targeted engagement with those people as i said i 'll just quickly fly through this we 're fortunate in noosa that because of the lay of the land the way the river is structured in the topography for us storm tide inundation is less of an issue than riverine flooding from a coastal hazardous perspective another issue that often flies under the radar is tidal inundation or in this case it 's called permanent inundation so each individual event is often seen as a low impact but in aggregate because they occur so often um the the the long-term impact can be quite large in terms of the um uh speeding up of damage to critical infrastructure but also the livability of a route of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's often the road reserve that um cops it um from tidal inundation and so if you think about in terms of a holiday maker visiting or a a resident with mobility issues trying to navigate their way through through their local area um that could present some um impossible barriers the other thing that has very rapidly came to light was though the inundation extents from permanent inundation aren 't that large until the very end of the century because of the low-lying nature of the land around the river and the style of stormwater network that we have being gravity fed long before we start to see severe impacts on land our underground infrastructure assets could be impacted and so through the work that we 've done it became quickly obvious that rather than wait for the chat to be finished using the hazard information that we 've got we could already start some additional side projects to understand and unpack what the impacts could be so an example of this is late last year we conducted a stormwater network vulnerability assessment to get um start getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their capacity reduced um by stormtime stormwater inundation sorry tidal inundation not only does that have an impact on quite an aged network that 's not designed to be exposed to saline water but it also reduces the intake capacity of the stormwater network so you would expect a certain rainfall event to um be able to flow into the stormwater network no problems but if it 's filled with water from the river that water has nowhere to go and then just sits on the street so it 's cognizant about time and also as part of this work we are also um looking to understand the risk to biodiversity so from from what i 'm aware we 're the only council participating in cucos that is going to that degree but as tony pointed out um we 've got a strong history of environmental conservation here in noosa not just as a council but as a community and so it 's very important to council and the community that we try to understand what the impacts could be from coastal hazards to some of the conservation assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect over the years however the most controversial um result for us has been our coastal erosion monolith results this is this is a look at a section of our eastern beaches which is the coastal open coast location and what you can see there is the red line is what the queensland government produced a few years ago and so whilst we 've got a less confronting result through our chat it 's still nonetheless a serious issue that we 're having to grapple with not just from the impacts to our foreshore areas which again a lot of people worked hard to protect we 've got private assets in the firing line whether they are residential assets dwellings tourist accommodation and also key infrastructure so for those of you not familiar with noosa that road is david lowway and what you can 't see in this image is that it could be cut in two different sections which would effectively isolate the communities that rely on that road for access to their neighborhoods um so that is something we are working through at the moment with our various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be commencing work on our broader climate change adaptation plan so for that we 're using a multi-sector approach um in line with the queensland government 's own adaptation strategy and that work will be guided by um predominantly the risk assessment framework developed by encarf but in more recent um more recent times there 's been a few more things that have come out in queensland the qer mf as well as i think lgaq is working on some work as well so we 'll incorporate what we need to uh when we need to um we 're quite fortunate in nusa to have a lot of uh high credentialed people here so we 'll be setting up a sector expert advisor group with people from inside council on that side and then the final step in that process will be developing a governance roadmap to ensure that climate change is appropriately considered across a whole range of areas of council from risk management asset management financial sustainability and the like at this stage we 'll be primarily looking at the direct risks from climate change we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what those transition and indirect risks will be but um that 's certainly uh those are certainly topics that um this council and all other councils might want to inform themselves of and um sitting across all of that is the financial and legal risks associated with climate change which this is the final slide some of the uh challenges we still have facing us a lot of them relate to stakeholder expectations um of what what council will and won 't do and how that reconciles with what council 's responsibilities are what it 's capable of doing and what the legal legal consequences of any decision along along that decision making process are and what need to be considered and for us on the one hand we i understand that we 're in a bit of a bit of a vanguard in queensland on on some of these topics which is um exciting and we we relish that challenge but at the same time there 's there 's um not insignificant amount of legal uncertainty around some of this so um that 's presenting a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the rank but we do see some opportunities um as i said earlier arising not just around sending those long-term signals but also being able to use the work we 're doing on the adaptation side to align with the work that we 're doing on our emissions reduction side and essentially the message there is our adaptation work is looking at a business as usual or a worst case scenario but that doesn 't have to be the case we can avoid this scenario by undertaking as a community and pushing more broadly for strong emissions reduction action and even if that doesn 't occur often as many of you probably know energy efficiency and energy independence a whole range of things around that side help with resilience on an adaptation side and so just finish up i can see my clock i 've got two minutes um more recently and as tony mentioned we declared a climate change emergency and so the reason we did that was um essentially boils down to two parts um we recognize that it 's important that the language of climate change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't really reflected the urgency of the situation and in addition by trying to move the conversation in that direction it helps to support the action in our stakeholders eyes around um that what council is doing around adaptation but in particular around emissions reduction if there is no climate emergency a lot of the question is what 's the rush but um we feel that and science is telling us that there is one and um that provides added justification for the work amongst all the other reasons that we 're doing around emissions reduction and that 's it thank you okay we 'll go to questions come and join me here grant um just to add to what grant just said about the climate emergency declaration of course another part was that we wanted to uh send a very clear message to higher levels of government uh that we 're all in this together basically so um you know given the ipcc 's report we have 12 years to take drastic action to avoid going higher than 1.5 degrees then you know we do need to be working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at these questions the first one is can you please summarize key positions within your organizational structure in relation to climate change mitigation and adaptation and any advice in establishing these so as i said we 've got a full-time carbon reduction officer that 's annie nolan we 're lucky to have her she 's fantastic and she has established a project control working group within the organisation and an organisational group that uh oversees implementation and we 're trying to of course uh weave all of uh this throughout the uh organization so that at every level people are thinking about both the issue of climate change but also our 2026 zero emissions target uh grants embedded with our um our planning staff in particular the strategic planners he sits in the same office as the strategic planners uh which has been fantastic while we 've been developing a planning scheme because there 's daily interaction between grants role um and the strategic planners do you want to add anything to that group uh no they 're just that um any our emissions production officer annie nolan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located within the environment team but we 're both within the planning and environment sustainable development department so that 's how that 's structured uh so the next question is following on from tim 's question how is having specific climate change positions impacted mainstreaming across the rest of the organization you can tackle that if you like it 's had a really big impact a really positive impact as i said that um the message from the top has been loud and clear um that this is something that all areas of council need to start getting across and we 're necessarily embedded um different parts of council on different different trajectories at the moment um our infrastructure services department has just been going through some of their longer-term asset management plans and so i was recognized straight away that well if we 're looking to spend millions on assets that have lives of 10 20 30 50 plus years we need to as an organization stop looking at historical precedence and start thinking about future conditions so that 's a big one another one is our disaster management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year or so in advance but within this council and as well as the message from a state level has been very much of late no no you need to start looking at what 's coming coming down the track because it 's coming fast and it 's a lot different to what we 've experienced so far so um climate change conversations around climate change touch essentially every area of council at the moment um yeah so it 's it 's very promising and i think we 're doing we 're doing pretty well yeah and as chair of the disaster management group i can confirm that the issue of climate change comes up in one way or another at every uh disaster management meeting next question is uh given the recent focus or drive for corporate disclosure of climate risks what is council 's appetite for public disclosure of risk information all or partial uh the simple answer is all we recognize that we have a duty of care to incorporate whatever the latest modelling and the latest science is into our decision making framework and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community which we 've been doing through the development of the coastal hazard adaptation plan of course there are risks associated with that because some people are gonna immediately start complaining that we 're impacting upon either their ability to redevelop sites or the land value of their properties etc but we accept that that 's part of the process there are going to be some losers in this process uh we 're not yet like wa at the position of trying to work out whether to defend or retreat but certainly the defend or retreat uh aspect is part of our thinking always yeah yeah i 'd add to that we 're not certainly not going to shy away from sharing the results of our risk assessment work with the community in fact i think that would be counterproductive because um we need the community support for the adaptation plan and the work that will flow from that and i i think you know you undermine the ability to get that support if they don 't even understand the scale of the problem so um i think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next one 's for you grant uh i work with local government this one 's from craig perry i work with local government in western australia has the climate resilient councils program assisted your council uh definitely in two parts i think the message from the counselors and our executive team to the presentations um that we received through the club this qcic program really helped wake open some of their eyes to the complexity around the issue like i said earlier a lot of people incorrectly conclude that climate change is just a civilized thing and through that program some of our councils who were maybe earlier on in their journey around understanding climate change it really opened their eyes to just how complex an issue this is and how it touches basically like no sector no discipline is is going to escape it to varying degrees and so yeah we found that really really beneficial and on the governance side like i said earlier the staff survey was really helpful in understanding where staff think they 're at where they think some of those gaps are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our interactions and sitting on various working groups across council seeing a gap between perhaps where people may think they are where i think council is and where we really need to go so that 's been really helpful the next one 's from helen peters hi i work with local government in tasmania what position will you be taking in your coastal hazards adaptation plan about protecting private property from coastal houses well this is a big issue obviously and it 's a bit unfair i 'm not sure if you 're still seeing the last slide that grant put up on the screen which is main beach and it 's kind of misleading because there 's a bit of a rock wall there on main beach but that 's actually historic that was built in the 1970s uh generally speaking we 've had a lot of discussions about this and the idea of hard walling or putting up hard infrastructure on the coastline is anathema to fortunately both staff and councillors we recognize that it has a number of problems not the least being that if you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for where the wall ends creating greater erosion but you also tend to lose your beach altogether if you 've got hard walls so there 's not a strong appetite along the coastal strip certainly to start protecting by putting in hard walling you want to add to that front yeah i will actually um i think on on a couple fronts uh like i said earlier what we 're seeing in other parts of the country and other parts of the world is it 's not until without sufficient planning it 's not until the hazard event is right in your face and is impacting on developed areas that anybody starts to think about this and that often leads to what could be viewed as knee-jerk reactions to its credit the qcos program and the guidance material that supports councils really drives home the notion of pathway dependency and really being cognizant of of um not falling into that trap so an example being using this example here nurse the main beach because there 's that legacy asset that was set up to defend assets behind it now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only will but has an obligation to maintain that asset and maintain that level of protection so we 're really cognizant as a project team that we at least consider all possible longer-term implications of whatever decision we make and that also includes not just pathway dependency but also any legal risks that come from making a decision today or not making a decision today around some of these responses around protect defend accept retreat what have you so um we uh we haven 't made any final decisions on that we 're we 're doing that in the next month um but um watch this space yeah i think the other thing to point out here given we 've talked about nissan main beach which is a key economic asset for the shire obviously and we want it to look as pretty as we can as much of the time as possible and that is that we 've got a permanent sand pumping system there which uses a venturi system to take sand from the river mouth and pump it back onto the beach so in a situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pumping and over a period of weeks replenish the sand on main beach um obviously that 's uh has an economic basis and the funding for that is in fact through a levy uh imposed upon hasting street uh businesses uh who are beside the main beach there but you know it 's obviously not an ideal scenario either but then the noosa spit and musa river mouth over the 70s and 80s were retrained and reframed with all manner of construction and we 're now paying the legacy for that what we do know is as soon as you try and uh try and force a dynamic system to behave the way you want you 're going to pay for it in one way or another there are going to be repercussions somewhere yeah the next question is from kingbro do you find that a mixture of tenures on the coast adds to adaptation planning complexity yes yes yes very much so i think it 's um we 're really fortunate that previous councils and previous planning staff some of some of whom are still with us really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were maintained and weren 't encroached upon so we 're really lucky that that first line of defense is still there but in some locations that that wasn 't maintained and so that 's proving quite complex in other locations where you 've got council assets in between private assets um sometimes it can the perception at least is that it 's a little bit easier to make a decision but yeah we 've got um a bit quite quite a bit of a mix um it certainly doesn 't make it easy no well thank you donovan um this one 's from our host ian in terms of advice for councils that are just starting out on work in climate change what do you think are the three most important steps oh deep breath um i wish we 've got this one beforehand yeah yeah obviously uh the first step is to have a political body that is in lockstep uh with the staff we 've been very fortunate here in all of our decision making in this regard it 's been pretty much unanimous decisions by the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole lot easier as grant pointed out for the staff because they have very clear direction and there is no ambiguity whatsoever so i mean ideally if you can manage it to get a political body that agrees with its approach is the first step yeah i would i would care that i would say um the bottom up has its place and bottom-up can be effective in certain things but i think with this particular topic um not just because of controversy around the science and what have you but even when you accept that some the more you dive into it the more confronting it becomes and so i think getting that um the elected and the executive teams on board and driving it from the top down um really should be the first step um in in any process and probably step two is making a commitment yeah i agree um particularly putting that policy um uh getting that policy setting right um like i said that was something that um we recognized was a little bit of a gap and that that is also important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know you might you may have a um this might not be the right way but a more enlightened council now but as we know counts the composition of councils can change and so it 's important to put down the foundation stones now so that they 're more resilient to i guess um changes later on and step three the resources yep exactly yeah yep budget allocations yeah and staff putting i mean the fact that we have two full-time staff uh both focused on a daily basis on this issue is enormously important in terms of the the trickle-down effect through the rest of the organisation yeah we 've we 've just brought on um a part-time third um supporting officer um and donovan talking about qcrc in his recommendations report flagged this very early on with council saying eventually you can this this team is going to need to be expanded um because the more you get into this the more you really realize the scale and complexity of the problem and it really does require all hands on deck so um staff resourcing is definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've run out of questions phew so i think that 's a perfect time for me to to jump back in and and thank you both for um for the webinar um it was it was really fantastic so thank you both tony and and grant for for taking the time and sharing sharing that all um just before everybody uh disappears i think um i just want to to reiterate that and and thank you and also i just wanted to just give you a bit of a heads up about what we 're doing in terms of the next webinars for the lab so obviously these webinars are um fortnightly and um so so our next webinar is same time on august 15th and we 're really excited because what we we have um eileen hall from who 's the ceo of would you would you aboriginal shy council up in the daintree um region who who will be doing a presentation that um is a bit of a modification of a presentation that she delivered to the adaptation conference last year and and it features mainly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically a climate change and how that local government can work with and and take on the knowledge as well as consider and involve um first nations people so that 's an incredibly uh we 're really really proud that eileen 's come on board with us to deliver this presentation and i think it will be an absolutely fantastic webinar um for those that because we uh really value those uh people who come on board with our webinars that um for the uh and we want to we we value your continuing engagement with us what we 're doing now is um trying to we 're doing 20 off on webinars for the next uh 24 hours so so if you need a discount code that 's woodrow uh w u j a l um so for those that don 't know the the climate change innovation lab is a not for profit um and um so we 're trying to do to do this at an absolute minimum for local government it was originally started by canberra council and funded through them so so we 're really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've sort of grown out of out of that and are now spreading our wings so if we 'd love to see you in the next two weeks but also we 've got a fantastic lineup for the next couple of months um focusing on climate risk in the water sector hewn valley council city of marathon marion thinking outside the square and data analysis and interpretation so a fantastic lineup of uh webinars over the next couple of months so that 's all from from us and thank you again to tony and grant and um hopefully we 'll see you again in the next two two weeks thank you so much thank you thank you you,"(-20.4018362, 148.5832116)"

Engagement,7dXI9pGn9zA,20210106,2668.48,"Proserpine QLD 4800, Australia",7900,series uh if you haven 't been here before welcome back to those who um are joining us for multiple of these webinars today we 'll be talking about uh community engagement before we get into that i just wanted to um for those that are just joining the the climate change innovation lab for the first time talk about what we 're doing which is the climate change innovation lab is a non-profit company we 're set up to explore real world challenges that climate change poses for local economies the environment communities and governance systems and we 're really focused on on local government as you know webinars are organized in a structured programs with participants engaging with a new topic on a fortnightly basis about today 's topic so today we 're talking about community engagement so i think despite being one of the most important societal challenges of the 21st century public engagement with climate change especially by local government remains extremely difficult so this webinar focuses on how public engagement can assist in the development of just processes and outcomes in adaptation of discourse today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an associate professor and co-founder of the center for deliberative democracy and global governance his research ties together the themes of political behaviour the public sphere and observations from deliberately deliberative meaning such as citizen juries his research covers the broad fields of deliberative democracy and environmental governance particularly in respects to climate change i 'm going to hand it off to simon now and i hope you all enjoyed today 's presentation over to you simon yeah thank you ian and hello everyone um welcome to the uh to the presentation to the webinar this is actually my very first ever webinar so uh it 's it 's going to be a new experience for me oops um we we had some technical difficulties uh getting this organized because i as you see i used lots of visuals and animations and we had to make the uh the system adapt um but by way of sort of an overview of what i hope to cover today there are quite a few issues i think everyone knows that this is a very important and challenging policy space and a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of muddling through together um i 'm going to actually really set it 's going to be some fairly high level discussion around the issues and and just to give a sense and the hope is that maybe in the future we can sort of drill down on some of the questions that are raised and issues that might be raised by by the uh both the topic and some of the the evidence from case studies that i 'm going to present uh now we we had a discussion about how to proceed and apparently we you can actually ask questions as you go now it 's great if you do that and if i see a question pop up on the screen i 'll address that as i see it um i 'm assuming that we 're not going to get uh sort of hundreds flying through and that 's not going to slow things down too much um so just uh just to proceed i i guess um so yes this presentation 's on climate change and community engagement um what i would like to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around things that i 'm sure all of you have thought about in trying to grapple with the sort of challenges in terms of climate change policy adaptation and public engagement as we know this is a very difficult space uh and it 's not it 's not been helped by the history of this this issue certainly in the australian context and other consistent constituencies we can have a discussion about that at the end of it if it 's relevant uh but i 'm not going to sort of preempt that too much now but what i 'd like to sort of cover very quickly now is just the sort of considerations about why we 're engaging what 's the rationale for engaging in the climate change space because there 's a whole series of considerations there which i 'm sure you 've all thought about who we 're engaging and how and how it 's going to be a key component of the of the presentation uh what i 'd like to try and demonstrate is the the the way that the public is engaged has real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibilities for actually implementing um policy and decisions and so on to deal with the challenges posed by climate change but also changes the public potentially as well in terms of transforming the way that we react as as resident citizens to to this policy area i could i could talk all day about that particular dynamic because that really is sort of research that i do but we 'll we 'll just glance over that as we go and then i want to talk about the implications uh what are the sort of downstream implications for the way that we engage the public around these issues and what is the wider impact but i will close off in terms of the challenges i mean there 's some very interesting findings with the sort of approaches that i 'm going to use as case studies but there are still challenges even though we get some pretty spectacular results in terms of costs and how we actually go forward and implement and affect the rest of the problem in the interest of the public being transmitted into policy space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for engaging the public a more practical one is the development understanding sorry i 'm just going to leave you up here simon yeah yes some of the people on the line are having some trouble hearing you is it possible that you can just put up your how about if i try and turn off the microphone and see if that improves things let 's just do it old style can you hear me better now is that hello hello personally i can hear you better um so they 'll just type in they say it 's the same is it possible just to turn it up slightly can i turn my microphone up let me just get into my settings and see if i can fix that i 'm sorry about this everyone another way that you can do it simon is on the right hand corner uh down next to your chat box there 's a circle inside a circle next to my chat box down very bottom bottom right okay down where the cursors are i can 't see it oh this one here yes um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that up slightly oh i see okay right hello hello is that better hello can you hear me better now ah the problem is that i can hear you better no you 're going to have to go into your settings apologies everybody um it 's actually good for me but apparently not for everybody else oh no no okay logan city council is going well that 's good news has still got to know uh what if i just try and speak up a bit is does that help well fine yep okay great oh it just got worse uh i wonder if that 's got to do with bandwidth is it sort of uh squelching out okay great okay fantastic it looks it looks like we 're okay okay so so how should we go should we proceed what do you think we keep going now yes just continue sorry for that okay that 's that 's that 's all good now where were we so we were talking about the development of good policy so engaging to understand the public to understand the policy challenges associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length about that i 'm sure you 're all familiar with those general dynamics and then there 's understanding the community and this starts to get to the sort of area that i 'm interested in in terms of you know we we talk about engagement and we have there 's traditionally been this model of understanding and engaging with the public that the public has sort of well-formed what the public wants should be translated into policy with delivery democracy the research area i work in researching it takes a slightly more nuance of that in terms of looking at ways in which we can actually enhance the way the public actually develops their own views and and ways to actually implement that inject that into sort of policy and decision making and the the the evidence i 'm going to show you actually will give you a window into what happens and how this you know how we understand the community transforms pretty dramatically in some cases when we actually engage in a deeper sense uh and then that includes how it might change in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as climate change proceeds and we 're already starting to see on large scale the sort of response that uh that is starting to accelerate in terms of the response to the challenge of climate change now if we 'd actually taken a snapshot ten years ago we said okay that 's it this is where we 're at we we we wouldn 't be you know we 'd be very surprised uh to actually see what 's happening now and in 10 years time that will be different again so it 's about getting window into those futures as well and and and trying to be part of that journey with the public that brings me to the last point in terms of engaging to build capacity to to to have the potential the ability to respond to the challenges posed by future uh future dynamics and particularly in relation to climate change and environmental change generally uh how do we actually improve the community response certain way of trying to sort of shape the community from a top-down sense but actually bring the community into and engage with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond and the future that we actually want to see in relation to climate change and ultimately that should actually improve the policy space it should actually give us the wiggle room to be able to implement the right sorts of policies that respond to those futures with a public on board now that 's of course a grand jester grand ideal the question is how do we actually get there so i want to try and give some sense of how that might be possible okay next slide this is actually recorded as a movie now because of uh i use animations and powerpoint not working so there 's going to be a couple of gaps here and there so what i want to do is is probably tell you something that you all probably know already uh is that climate change is pretty tough when it comes to engagement now this actually sort of preempts a little bit of what i 'm going to talk about later but what i 'm showing you right now is i do research on what happens when you engage deliberatively in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how how participants develop as a group more sophisticated views for views that actually integrate a lot of different considerations that make sense and actually sort of articulate them in ways that are quite sophisticated climate change in particular can be a bit problematic in terms of you know there 's a tendency to focus on very specific ideas without actually looking at the bigger picture and this index is supposed to capture a change in those dynamics now it 's much more complicated than that and i don 't i i 'd love to actually spend an hour talking about this but what i do want to show you is that what we know is that deliberative forms of engagement improve dramatically in some cases this this process this actually sophistication of use opens up possibilities for actually reasoning through issues now it doesn 't mean that we all agree it means that we actually all understand together what the nature of this issue is and we actually on the same page in terms of reasoning about it you can only see a play button oh can you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very unfortunate oh okay well we thought we 'd actually uh found a way past the limitations with the technology here i 'm very sorry about this i guess the best we can do is give you access to the movie file and or the the powerpoint file afterwards now if you could see this you would actually see a graph with a whole series of bars okay some some do some don 't i 'll speak to it anyway and explain the content and and you know we can actually provide the file later on i 'm very very sorry about this um what this graph showed politics around the issue is that the the public view is formed by the public discussion around this and then this is a bit problematic in sort of in terms of a wider political space um i just wanted to show you that to tell you something again that you probably already know this is a this is is kind of a tough nut to crack in terms of getting a window into this issue but nonetheless there are there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh over a longer term and the dynamics around public public views and public engagement on climate change okay um this is going to be a problem down the track with some other slides unfortunately we 're okay just for now at least now can you see the text at least at the moment yep okay someone can yes okay that 's that 's great oh i i always get very disappointed when people can 't see these these uh graphics that i spend quite a bit of time working on but uh but nonetheless okay so chrome chrome works so it 's it 's possible this might actually be a function of the of the browser that you 're using for for the seminar okay so the next part the next point that i want to make is that it 's a tough issue but um how this actually proceeds as an issue is a function of how you know the politics plays out on one level but how we actually also engage with the public and shape these issues together if you like and i want to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago on just how the public response can actually roll out under you know sort of governance conditions as usual if you like um and the research finds it 's been repeated actually we did it in the uk and i 'm going to show you the australian counterpart to this research which uh which illustrates just how problematic this could potentially become if we don 't actually respond adequately in an engagement you know now or from this point forward okay but i also want to actually demonstrate that engaging quickly does open a window for implementing effective strategies as well okay right so the first case study actually uh there 's going to be two case studies that i 'll talk about overall um but the first one is actually study we conducted here in canberra we actually brought in residents from goldman as well there 's a two uh study this one the first one was to actually look at how does the public potentially respond to climate change in the future and what other governance implications of of experiencing that change and then how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems so what we actually did is we interviewed 100 residents around around canberra and goulburn and we showed them a whole series of climate a climate change scenario as a series of slides indicating different impacts in terms of temperature um food production etc etc uh water water use rainfall drought all these sorts of things we did some modeling with people from csiro and climate models at the anu we we worked their data into these slides that we could present to the public we showed them to the people and we said okay we surveyed them in terms of what they thought about climate change and governance beforehand then we surveyed them after they experienced um two scenarios one was a medium and one was a high emission scenario this is the high this is the more extreme one okay i 'm just going to show you two slides from this now i guess you can 't see this but if you if you can 't see this i 'm actually showing you a map of a temperature gradient graph for new south wales uh but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar that shows on the left hand side how average temperature increases to 2050 and then 20 100 it goes uh on average up six degrees uh 2.6 degrees at 20 50. the second slide here um show shows actually grape production line grape production and whenever i show this slide especially overseas and people are fans of australian wine this is the way it actually invokes the strongest reaction but if you can 't see the graph what it actually shows is just how on climatic terms the range for growing australian wine decreases very dramatically uh 2050 and certainly by 2100 we have some problems now that 's not to say there 's not ways to actually deal with that with genetic engineering changing uh other practices and so on but just in terms of climatic parameters there are some there are some issues there so we showed these these participants all these slides surveyed them afterwards and what we did is had we we then generated a map of all the positions in relation to climate uh climate change and governance um to try and get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into in terms of how can we manage you know all these different views around climate change and expectations on people like yourselves who are trying to do good work uh in in in sort of sorting through this issue i 'm not going to focus on the details here just that if can people see this this slide just to check quickly i don 't want to take up all their time actually asking if people can see the slides but it 's worth checking yep okay great that 's fantastic okay what the what the statements are actually uh sort of shortened versions of the the statements that were part of the survey and they what we do is we actually use factor analysis to actually group together where individuals cluster and this is the position uh in these these bubbles in the diagram that represent those main positions let 's actually not worry too much about the actual statements themselves what i want to do is just give you an overview of three of the important positions here this if you like is a kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know in the act space anyway open space in relation to governance we we the three main positions were kind of a skepticism the deep climate skeptics actually didn 't fit on the map we actually had to do a whole new analysis for them and that 's a different paper and i won 't talk about that today but that was very interesting um that part of it but there was a kind of a mild milder form of skepticism here that stood on the the shelf if you like um on the fence sorry and um but what i shared in common with actual the second discourse the second position um was was a focus on government for doing something about this issue and this is a narrative that went through almost all participants that it wasn 't actually about the community and how we respond to climate change it was about you know we sit back we vote for government they do something about it and they fix the problem for us um and of course that leads into a dynamic of the things go wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis of governance and democracy that we talk about the trust deficit if you like uh is yeah if that 's not going well and your expectations of high high-end we potentially have a spiraling effect there and we see this in in relation to discourse b uh it 's you know that that believed the climate change was a a reality um but it 's up to the government to do something about it we also i 'm not going to worry about a short pragmatism we 'll leave that aside for now um but alarm defeatism uh is was really important here in the sense of you 'll see in a moment this is where we tended to move towards um was was even worse than just blaming government and relying on them to do something about it it was actually just switching off altogether a decreased willingness to cooperate with any collective efforts to do something like this and i cite the example of things like water restrictions where people feel like they 're in it for themselves and they 're more willing to sort of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of what we consider as appropriate behavior and trying to adapt and so this is deeply problematic from a climate change adaptation perspective so i 'm just going to show you the migrations uh in terms of positions so we actually look at where participants tend to fit on before where we actually before we went through the scenario and where where participants moved to and we have i i understand i can actually draw here you 'll see there 's a very strong movement in this direction um toward increased tendency to blame government you know realization or acceptance that this this is real but again emphasis is on government doing something about it but also a movement in this direction towards alarm defeatism and this person in particular we really had to sort of offer some counselling and things got so dramatic uh in terms of of actually um dealing with the the consequences and we we see this in actually broad scale i mean this this research is 10 years old now and it 's reasonable to say that we 're actually seeing some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of especially in rural areas increases the levels of mental health issues and so on associated with the stress induced by climate change and that has knock on governance impacts of course and we i think we all understand those implications so this is a long way of telling you something we did 10 years ago that you probably already know is is is a serious consideration oh now how do i actually erase okay i just raised my marks here okay oh oh you know you can do it for me so what can be done so what i want to do is actually give you a sense a window into what deliberation did deliberative enforcement engage with did to change these dynamics amongst those participants at least and i 'll actually get to the point of what how do we actually uh do this achieve this these dynamics written large i 'm going to run out of time very quickly here i believe we 've only got 40 minutes uh we 're now 25 in so i 'm going to have to go through this pretty quickly now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement uh what i 've been arguing is that they can help build capacity they can help inform policy in a deeper sense in terms of how we understand the dynamics of this issue rolling out and a window into how the public can actually change and be brought along in terms of you know adapting and actually dealing with the issue the issue the important question is how we how we actually perform this sort of engagement um writ large if you like within the rest uh you bring the rest of the public along and there are increasing ideas and technologies around how we can do that i probably can 't speak to that in any detail today but i will actually uh allude to them there are some innovations globally that actually starting to do this sort of work and there 's some fascinating work to be done in europe in this space as well informed by our research if i 'm being modest as well in terms of this we have less impact in australia than we do actually in europe which is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberation deliberate democracy i just wanted to make some quick points here again i could spend all the whole session actually talking about the liberty democracy and what it means but i wanted to just make some key points here uh sorry i mean i 'll let this slide run through now okay very very broad terms uh i 'm sure you 've come across the term um but we the way we talk about deliberation it 's sort of a a process of actually working through issues collectively that are characterized by some ideal features um that actually help facilitate us reasoning and understanding you know sort of the the all other perspectives and actually developing positions the main features things like openness uh respect for alternative arguments and focus on communication over strategies so politics is often about actually winning the argument at all costs getting elected and so on deliberative democracy talk or deliberation focuses on a sort of communication to actually develop understanding and so on and it all sounds a bit airy fairy but there are some practical implications associated with that deliberate democracy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these processes that actually it ideally involves deliberation across all sites in parliament and within with republican cafes and then family around the dinner table and so on uh how we actually improve the way that we actually think can talk about these sorts of issues um and it does that in a way that actually ideally includes everyone affected by the issue and actually connects citizen deliberation to decision making and there 's a whole set of theories about how that can work which we don 't have time to get into but i do want to emphasize that deliberation in terms of the many public and citizens jury is not the same as deliberative democracy it can certainly contribute to that agenda but it 's not the same thing so if you ever hear someone saying we ran a minute public and it 's a deliberate democracy exercise um it 's it 's a bit of a problematic claim so i just wanted to i wanted to actually make that point and hopefully that will make sense in in the final slide okay here 's the uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement so let 's go back to the climate change and the public sphere um study um and i 'll show you what happened when we pulled 40 of those participants from that that research into a three-day deliberative process and we saw how problematic those positions were in terms of as climate change rolled out what we did is we actually surveyed them again and then we surveyed them after the the process as well as interviewing uh getting qualitative data as well and we looked at what this did and how the how it informed implications for governance and public engagement and the same thing for the uh for the sydney case study we did some work with the sydney city council uh in terms of climate change adaptation policy okay so so this is the sort of broad map that we saw before with the uh with the climate change uh adaptation uh study in canberra um the the key feature here is that a three-day delivery process this we had two deep skeptics the left okay we got some transformation but the real story here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the debate around this around this issue okay so i hope you can see this because this is kind of important but let me speak to it we got the broad skepticism government focused part but the the nature of the language changed both in terms of the survey and the way that participants spoke about it it was less let 's blame government the emphasis is on them to do something about it it was more on we need to do something it was a partnership model if you like approach approach with with government at different levels and dealing with this but then when we started to see uh other discourses emerge that strongly overlap here um so it was kind of hard to tease them apart but it was more sort of collective action oriented in terms of taking more responsibility individually to contribute to actually adapting to this and so you can see that there are some clear governance implications for changing the way that the community responds uh to this now this is a small mini public um but the question is if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public sphere if you like yeah it has the potential to actually change the the whole policy space so we do deal with it in this in relation to this issue so that 's the climate change uh ict study and then goldman the second study now this this may be problematic um hopefully you can see this as well the the work we did with sydney was a bit more applied than the canberra one so the process itself was actually oriented around sydney council 's desire to find clear areas to focus on in their adaptation strategy and it was about actually deciding whether um any other adaptation strategy should focus on risk approaches which tends to be the the dominant language or has been at least uh in relation to adaptation in terms of this is what we 've got this is how we operate what are the risks to that life if you like this approach actually looked at climate change is going to happen and it 's going to change the way we experience our world uh let 's get a window into that world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to do in terms of shaping that future in this part of that reality now i 'm sorry that the uh okay there 's some really good questions there so are there other resources yes look there there are resources i mean we can actually email this out afterwards the city sydney council does actually have a strategy which which speaks specifically to this case uh and we and there are two papers that i submitted that actually talk about these case studies more broadly but i 'm happy to actually dig out other resources and distribute them um oh a very good question from ian um do i think this was skewed by canberra people and and the fact that our inner city sydney absolutely so there is a difference there was a difference in response between canberra uh and and um and golden goldman tended to be there was a slightly different dynamic in broad terms were very similar but there were definitely differences there was a bit more so self-reliance in canberra and a bit less cynicism uh in relation to this than amongst canberra canberra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand about those dynamics sydney was a bit different um definitely definitely the location shapes we know this about australian politics that has an impact on these things but let 's move right along because we 're running out of time for questions here um look what i 'm going to say here is that i think i have to rely on on sort of the sydney report and maybe the paper we 've got here is again the symme case changed the language and it actually changed the focus on trying to maintain the lifestyle we have to actually looking at the future um and not only did it change the actual sort of the language around this the way with the way this issue was discussed it also generated some really interesting practical recommendations for the sydney council in terms of areas they hadn 't thought of themselves um that would that are worth focusing on and that 's because the the language around you know the the ex the experience around this in terms of consulting the public as they stand generated certain discussion but then getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative form of thinking around what could and should be done so they 're very very happy uh very pleased in terms of that window into that future world and and part of what they 're doing and i guess we 're seeing this in terms of the response we 're seeing now is actually about trying to actually facilitate building capacity to actually meet the challenges of that world okay so i 'm sorry that i 've gone through very quickly uh these case studies i would love to actually spend a lot more time teasing it apart but i just want to get quickly to the punch line here what are the implications i i 'd argue um that both case studies actually demonstrate the potential for improved adaptation i mean though those resources are there without actually dramatically changing the community this was this was a fairly simple mechanism and one way to actually induce those sorts of responses so in terms of proving policy space it actually transformed the the discourse from you know compared to resilience and risk management um to actually meeting challenges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the question i 've raised a few times in terms of scaling these these considerations up and i think it 's really important to think about the way we actually use if there is an interest in using these these mechanisms and certainly it 's growing overseas and i hope it continues to grow in australia there was interest a lot of interest uh around about 2000 to 2010 it seems to have died off a bit but it seems to be growing again i think the important thing is to focus uh on the way we design and the way we use these processes and it 's really important to find technologies if you like to actually to you know get it to to maintain the integrity of the process but also to articulate it to the rest of the public rather than actually coming up with a wish list or general statement to find ways to actually communicate these dynamics um and when there 's some good research that demonstrates there is potential in other countries uh that this has been done to actually influence and inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not quite there in australia because we 're not socialized politically into thinking about politics and engagement this way there is certainly potential there the other one is resourcing of course these things cost money and any engagement process does um it 's certainly we 're thinking about this in terms of it 's a cost-benefit approach in terms you think about what 's at stake and what the potential benefits of actually you know providing resources to to engage in this way and doing that systematically there 's much more to discuss there they 're the key points i 'm very sorry this has taken longer um than expected but i want to thank you all for for listening in and hopefully you 've you 've got something to take away from from the presentation okay so questions um hello cans by the way i actually grew up in cairns fort douglas so it 's uh that 's uh close to heart um and it 's also one of the case studies we hope to use in the research for city council but things sort of fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in social media which is often negative response it 's a really really good question and we do know that the growth of the use of social media works against the sorts of engagement deliberative engagement dynamics in terms of opening minds and engaging constructively that we talk about and this is a serious challenge what we don 't know is the extent to which this is a function this is just a mirror uh a worse version but a mirror of the the the broader uh sense that we actually engage politics in the way we actually understand how we should engage politically uh we want to do research that actually we 're proposing this at the moment to actually look at where there is a mirror of of of the way we actually you know sort of engage in these issues or whether it bring has its own dynamic and how we can actually influence improve the potential for actually changing the discussion in a manner which we would understand as being more deliberative there 's a fair way to go on this issue but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with because of course online has the advantage of being potentially inclusive although it is increasingly questions around whether it really is inclusive when you look at the actual numbers of people that do engage online um but the deliberative quality of that is is definitely a question and uh it 's a big one okay very good quote very good question uh from a local government perspective is there a risk of raising unrealistic expectations while engaging well there is if you if you raise the the expectations too high and and this i think has been a problem with using this form of engagement uh in many respects it 's often portrayed as a sort of a quick fix if you like this this this is the answer um to to all that problems and it 's not the product that the issues are still there uh it 's a matter of actually using language around it which which which which is realistic saying look okay this and it can 't be the only strategy it has to you can inform wider strategies but it 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in a broader systemic uh sense as well so yes i you know i think there is a risk but there are also incredible opportunities if it 's actually um conceived and managed and implemented well and we find ways to actually articulate this with the rest of the public and and develop so an understanding and actually address some of the misconceptions around this as well so politicians uh for example especially at the federal level really don 't like the idea because there 's a perception that it it bypasses sort of regular political processes and it really should not be conceived that way recruitment from ian a very good question there 's all sorts of ways you can create but the idea is that you you generate [Music] a pool of participants that reflect the broader community in a number of senses so it 's not just about uh you know getting big numbers and so on but it 's about saying you know what are the sort of demographic criteria that we can mirror in that process but increasingly we understand that it 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working through those and seeing how the process actually transforms that as well uh and we 've done a bit of work on on that uh here as as well and that there are some specific technologies of which we could potentially talk about if there 's some practical practical uh issues that to work through later um now if i missed anyone here i think i missed one yeah amanda sorry i missed one earlier especially around how you pull okay are there other resources you can point to us online about the processes that we used especially around how you pull residents back from focusing on actions to focus on what 's important well okay really good point so this is something that actually happened as part of the process itself um both papers talk about this and maybe not just in as direct terms as what you mean but this is something happened when you actually you know provide the space to to pull back and reflect on on the big picture if you like okay so we 've got another question do you know if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes yes um there are actually lots of examples and so what i would actually point to there is a resource called partisapedia partisapedia it 's like wikipedia that participate with participation instead um we can actually email this out to everyone uh if you if you if you need uh sort of directions to find it it actually if you if you search the database you will actually find quite a few examples within australia where this has been done we had a pretty good look around this is 2014. there 's certainly lots of interest and i know there are examples i think byron bay for example did something in this space as well um but it seems like it 's tailed off uh more recently so thank you so he actually jumped in and and uh and done this for it for us um but what i would say though is is um i haven 't actually so i i tend to sort of research the process rather than the use although we 're moving a bit into that space as well um i think again we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility sometimes as well okay simon um i think that oh we might just do this one more question from john duel cambridge council and then and then we might wrap it up if that 's okay with you um yeah absolutely uh linking to young families is very difficult and you 're absolutely right and and this is a major challenge in recruiting for these sorts of processes it 's very very hard to get anyone under the age of 25 particularly women it 's very hard to have a process that 's more than maybe a morning with anyone who has a family especially a young one involved and there are a couple of ways around this one is resourcing um so we have arrangements where we provide child care and so on um there are ways around it but it is it is absolutely difficult um i guess that 's all i can say for now fantastic well thank you simon um it 's it 's been really really interesting personally i don 't actually know that much about deliberative democracy in this form of of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me um thank you very very much for for taking the time um and for everybody who 's been on the line thank you for your tolerance as we as we sorted out some of those technical issues it was a bit of a bumpy road this time um those resources to to people um following up from from the webinar i 'll send that out in the in the email there um so in terms of next week uh unlike every other time we we aren 't going on a fortnightly basis next week we are doing doing a webinar next thursday and it will be delivered by donovan burton about organizational management and leading from the top now donovan burton heads the climate planning team and is a leading climate change adaptation expert um as a governance person he 's got a diverse portfolio of experience having completed more than 150 climate change risk and adapt adaptation projects personally i 've done a lot of work with with donovan and it 's been my pleasure to travel around with him doing governance assessments in a lot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and and work in the interview councils uh to work out where they 're currently up to when it comes to climate change so um i encourage you to to be there next thursday um and as always we 'll send out a request for any questions that you have about the process um and as always um thank you and we welcome your feedback about how these webinars are going thank you very much thank you i 'm not sure you can hear me but thank you all thank you i guess the question is am i still,"(-20.4018362, 148.5832116)"

Management,UxmVIWsdSHw,20210106,2570.64,"Proserpine QLD 4800, Australia",5441,these webinars about the climate change innovation lab firstly welcome um if you hadn 't been aware that the climate change innovation lab or the lab is a not-for-profit public company where we 're set up to explore real-world challenges that climate changes poses to local economies the environment communities and governance systems at the moment we 're running a fortnightly webinar program that is specifically set up for for local government but welcome to everybody else as well and what we 're doing is we 're doing a new climate change expert or practitioner every fortnight to look at a different topic you know over a 40 minute period and what we 're trying to do is bring together diverse departments and mainstream their response to climate change today 's topic is presented by robin burkett who is the principal engineer waterways at macquarie regional council she commenced in a council in 2004 following six years working in the in an engineering consultancy she has a bachelor of engineering from james cook university and is a registered professional engineer queensland she loves living in regional queensland and has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on flood and storm water management studies but in the last five years climate change adaptation has been an area of particular interest today robin will be focusing on climate change risk management uh with a particular focus on uh makai regional council so i 'll just hand it off to to robin now and thank you everybody and i hope that you enjoy the the webinar robin over to you thanks ian and good afternoon everyone i 'll go through the presentation in around 20 minutes and then i have about 20 minutes to answer questions so feel free to put your questions in the chat section on the webinar i 'd like to say upfront that we haven 't got climate change risk management fully sorted but we are on our way to better understanding the impacts managing the risks and harnessing the opportunities of a changing climate now what is the difference between uh climate climatic events such as cyclone storms and bushfires compared to climate change well really um cyclones and storms we deal with these events every year and we 've got a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's emergency management team which is typically very busy for the six months from november to april keeping us safe the climate change is a risk multiplier for these climatic events and we can expect a progressively changing climate that is warmer and has more intense rainfall and rising sea levels an example of the changing climate um that we 've experienced recently in makai is the heat wave and bushfires uh at the end of 2018 where we had seven days above 35 degrees and bush fires in the rainforest at younger now some of these communities affected by the bushfires were still recovering from cyclone debbie one year earlier having an event after an event weighs on the recovery of the community so we really need to focus on prevention and preparedness not just response and recovery so today i 'm going to describe our current approach to climate risk management at council i 'll go through our climate adaptation policy our risk management framework and how it fits in with other strategies also talk through some case studies for some of our high risk areas um mick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government-funded uh seawall and nourishment works after sci-fi and debbie and cremorne which is currently managed through emergency management measures we 've got some key take home visit measure messages and then we 'll have 20 minutes for questions so managing climate risk to me is very important particularly as it 's my children and grandchildren that will be the ones impacted by our decisions today i like to think in a linear approach but unfortunately a changing climate doesn 't we 've been using projections of 4 degrees increase by 2100 with the sea level rise of 0.8 meters but we could experience events with similar impacts much sooner we 've seen oppressive hot days experienced in cairns in november december and february where there was 17 days with above 35 degree temperatures and this is the number expected around the year around year 2050 and the climate projections from the queensland state heatwave risk assessment from 2019 in floodplain management we 're looking at a full range of events up to the probable maximum flood to manage our risk and one of the key messages that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probabilities larger than lives expected are what we could experience them sooner than what is predicted so just some context with where we sit so makai is situated on the northern central coast of queensland we have 320 kilometers of mainland coastline and more than 24 coastal communities we experience a cyclone one every two years which goes within 150 kilometers of makai and 40 of our properties are affected by coastal and flood hazards over the last decade council has been using climate change projections and flood studies and in 2015 council adopted a climate change adaptation policy and revised the policy last year the policy outlines council 's commitment to managing climate risk and enhancing the resilience of council and our communities infrastructure and natural areas it 's also about embedding climate change in the way of in the way of thinking and acting we also have our environmental sustainability strategy which is the primary document to deliver climate change initiatives and i 'll go into this shortly in a framework showing how it relates to all the other works that we 're doing so the strategy establishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monitor progressive impacts of climate change and on our progress towards specific climate change event litigation and adaptation targets is just a bit of a framework um that we have which shows how our different instruments relate to the legislation so you can see here we have our enterprise risk management framework and we have our planning scheme and we have our climate change adaptation policy and sustainability strategy one of the key things for successful implementation of strategies is a good working group so we have project control groups that work with us to make sure that we 're following our actions and providing good governance on those strategies so we have our flood and storm strategy sitting underneath our sustainability strategy as well as our storm smart strategy which is uh formerly our coastal and inland flood adaptation strategy so they all have working groups and that feed into the actions to provide governance on the implementation of those strategies below those we have works on the ground which say which describe the activities and the actions that we 're doing on the ground such as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some of the coastal studies so they 're the ones that show the priority actions and how we 're responding to climate our enterprise risk management framework was implemented in 2011 and revised in 2018. the framework includes strategic risk identification analysis monitoring and review so risk management is integrated with the annual operational plan which then translates into our annual budget activities so we have our risk reference sheets that we have for assets finance and all those ones that you can see through there environmental related risks account for around half of the high risks in the strategic risk register after additional treatment these extreme and high risks are managed actively with biannual meetings so we that 's our our area where we can say that if we 're not achieving those objectives we might need uh additional budget to uh address those high-risk activities so that 's how we manage those through biannual reviews so some of those um residual high or high level risks are those about natural or human-made disasters climate change adaptation and mitigation climate change through inherited assets or legacy issues cyber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have are no different to those identified in the world economic format forum 's global risks landscape of 2019 so our top risks of natural disasters failure of climate change adaptation and cyber security in addition to weapons of mass destruction are some of the biggest challenges that humankind has ever encountered which sounds like a good movie uh today i don 't have time to go through uh the climate change risk management process however i 'd like to just uh identify that there 's some really good tools out there through post-it and the climate change adaptation decision support tool and there 'll be links to those documents on this webinar now i 'd like to go through some of the case studies for our high-risk activities but one of the things since i 've been in council for over 15 years is that actions take a long time and sometimes it 's decades each community is different in their acceptance of risk and ability to act and this changes over time following different circumstances in our experience it comes after a tipping point such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for residents the first um case study is on new q1 space which had its adaptive tipping point in 2015 and 16 following a large erosion scarp which was around 15 meters from the boundary of residential properties so mckeown 's uh is located around 12 kilometers south of macquarie just where i 'm pointing my pointer at the moment and it 's had significant erosion over the last 50 years the shoreline has receded by 95 meters in some sections and over the last decade council 's been working with the residents to identify an acceptable solution around 10 years around in 2006 uh council prepared engineering drawings for a sequel and asked the residents to consider pay back to council however this proposal failed to gain support and sand nourishment was proposed but that wasn 't funded around 10 years later in 2016 uh residents came together to sell from the construction of a 240 metre long seawall costing around three thousand dollars per lineal meter this here is just an aerial image of what it looked like in 1962. uh it was really a holiday destination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the beach you can see the erosion this is the shoreline back more than 50 years ago and the shoreline where it currently sits now with the sea wall down on the bottom right is the picture of what the seawall currently looks like in this case uh the sequel was constructed on council freehold land which was then subdivided into allotments uh joining with the boundaries of the residential lots titles were then transferred to adjoining landowners and amalgamated with the adjoining land that 's the resident 's responsibility to maintain the sea wall and easements were granted over the seawall to ensure that it could be maintained in the future and the sea wall has an expected life of around 50 years this is an example of like the adaptation plan from nikon 's beach where you can see they were in standby mode for quite a while well there was discussions about what to do the government funded sea all didn 't get up beach nourishment really didn 't get up until the residents came together to outline a proposal to self-fund the seawall so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and whether we do get 50 years out of it before it needs to go to another control measure such as retreat but at the moment there 's emergency management controls been in conjunction with the seaboard so there 's further details about um the legal effects of the seawall in a paper that was delivered to the enclave climate adaptation conference last year the second case study is midge point where the adaptive tipping point was in 2017 following a cyclone debbie so midge point is one of council 's 24 coastal communities which is approximately 70 kilometers north of makai it 's had ongoing erosion issues that have been impacting each point for decades this has been quite a lot of illegal work over the years such as um placing geofabric over the beach and up the trunks of um coconut trees but that was all destroyed by cyclone debbie and remediation works removed that gi fabric at the time as well so the coastal works that came about at mitch point and now to approximately 4.6 million dollars and included a 240 meter long uh barrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 per lineal meter and has just been completed there 's also sound nourishment around a 900 meter length of frontal dune re-vegetation activities and the installation of control beach access points which are just being completed these works were from a commonwealth and state and queensland government funded so the same hall has an expected life for 50 years and sand nourishment will be required around every 10 years or following a significant storm event local management of the beach is covered by the midpoint local coastal plan which is available on council 's website and the local coastal plan enables all the organizations community groups and residents to work together to better use and achieve the best outcomes for the coastal environment and bench point this is just one of the local coastal plans that uh implemented in the region and there 's currently 19 coastal plans available which um detail the priority action activities for these coastal communities and at the moment coastal fencing weed control and re-vegetation is some of the most common activities for each of the coastal units and over time being resident in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities do particularly in those areas where they 're not actively being eroded due to other reasons the next um case study that i have is about cremorne and it is an emergency management measure that 's been currently being implemented for that area and cremorne sits um in the piney river floodway so this is come on up here in the middle between north has a history where it 's been heavily impacted by flooding from severe events in both 1918 and 1958 and there was lots of lives in both of these events there are currently uh 12 properties with homes that designed low impact industry and in the mid-2000s there was a buy-back scheme so around half of the properties were previously uh purchased by council and in conjunction with the state um due to their flood risk but um grants to enable the buy-back properties have really been unlimited supply um since the 2000s so at the moment an extreme flood risk for these properties with up to two metres of water and high velocities council has tried in the past to design the land as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overturned following community engagement and the current designing of low industry impact prevails the current risk management strategy for this area is to evacuate early we have door knocking as soon as um flooding in the pioneer river is predicted and residents are advised and have understood their flood risks as many of them have lived in the era for decades just recently residents have advised that they 're experiencing different difficulties in selling their property and the majority of the dwellings would be greater than 50 years so there is a risk that the properties could be unsold and you have new dwellings could be constructed which is an issue that we 're currently looking at in our floodplain management plan which will be released in the second half of this year and in this photo here you can see so all the streets are flooded in uh king tide events and that just shows the sort of level of immunity that they have in crime some of the take-home messages that i just wanted to leave you with before i wrap up this presentation uh it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about considering climate risks with probabilities larger than those expected because climate change is a threat multiplier and that these events could happen sooner than expected we 've always got every year a risk of getting a one in a thousand year event so we 've just got to be prepared and have management measures that address that risk if you 've got an existing risk management process in your council use it climate change risk management is an integral part of risk management and it 's not separate to other risk management tasks and it 's a really good link to provide feedback to your budget process the other one is an adaptive pathways approach is preferred because on the ground action requires community support may take decades for action but being warned just being warned that you have a risk assist in the recovery even if an event was to occur so now that 's the end of my presentation but i 'm really interested to hear what you 've got in your questions um yeah we are on a journey to better understanding the climate change and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and improve on the way that we do because we really want to avoid economic decline about if we don 't address our climate risks thank you so i 've got a question here has any consideration being given into making these risks transparent to the community uh what strategies of engaging the community have been effective so the first one um making these public we have the hazards identified in our planning scheme uh we do engagement about the flood studies that we undertake so while we haven 't made all our risks transparent they are evident in our planning scheme and other studies when we 're engaging with the community we 've found that local engagement is effective getting down to the communities and understanding what they know because often they 've had decades or even centuries worth of living in some areas so their knowledge and understanding of how things work is best so really at the local scale we found the best effective can you provide an overview of how you develop the resilience strategy that was done in house yeah um with for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get um specialist consultants on board to provide peer advice but often they 're done in-house and we feel that doing strategies in-house just lets us integrate them better within our current systems uh having worked in consultancy before doing a big strategy and not seeing implemented is one of the reasons i actually came to council to work because there 's nothing like seeing a document and not going to good use and being integrated into operations the question has makai regional council completed an adaptation strategy uh we 've been working on an adaptation strategy since 2013 um with um we 're sort of doing it at our own pace uh because our focus has been at the moment on our floodplain management plan which considers both uh storm tide and riverine and coastal hazards so we 're sort of doing an integrated approach and not just focusing on the coastal hazards next one with the adaptation at mcewen speech was the was this organized by council and funded through raids uh the mccurry 's beach uh i think is an erosion progress association was established by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to twelve of those residents that came together and had us i suppose a chairperson who was actively involved with council to facilitate that they actually funded the design and construction of the sequel and council provided legal support and planning applications uh support for that process so it was really a community driven project at the q1 speech uh how did the residents of nicuhen speech reached the point where they agreed to pay for the roadmap or well the tipping point for the mcewan speech residents was that they 'd already seen 95 meters of their beach be lost in 50 years it was getting quite close to their property boundaries and illegal structures weren 't working so they understood that they needed to do a proper formal uh process and uh go through the right loops and it was really a collaborative approach between council and the community also has council considered other climate change risks that are not coastal hazards eg the impact of climate change on fisheries and tourism sectors i suppose we 're looking at the lgaq climate uh resilient council 's framework to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with how we 're addressing climate change risk management our focus has been on those high priorities such as flooding and coastal hazards however the the statewide program where we 're looking at all those climatic events will be taken into account in a wider sort of strategy i suppose we 'd also be looking at the qcads so the queensland climate adaptation the sector plans that have been prepared for those sectors we 've also got industry that are looking at doing similar sustainability strategies and i think they 're also part of our advisory group for the sustainability strategy ian 's got a question what 's the process monitoring or evaluating how these risks are being managed over time well the process through our strategic risk register is um bi-annual reviews so those high risks are being looked at by the audit committee every six months um yeah so that 's the answer to that question does mackay council have concerns about legal liability and ongoing maintenance of approved structures which for sure we have about four kilometers of um urban sequels that have some have approval some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment uh because they are in addition with our coastal communities they 're at risk and primarily our concern at the moment is making sure that they 're safe for the community see there 's some people typing a few questions just trying to read them there 's other ones please explain how the payment structure was structured um i think this question from helen peters might be in relation to the michelin speech and the payment system so the residents are the group of residents at econs beach actually funded that so they worked out the costing structure themselves melissa warrick asked do you know of life for like replacement of infrastructure where the replacement of a bridge for example has considered climate change so we use for flood studies and things like bridges we look at the impact of the tail water so a point near the sea level rise in some areas we can 't afford to make them resilient to the increase having a 20 increase in rainfall intensity um but we always look at betterment when we 're doing replacement of infrastructure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you bought uh ian asks how have you brought the elected members of council on board with managing these risks i 've actually got the mayor of the kai regional council here at the moment we have greg williamson so i don 't know if greg if you 'd like to answer that question so the question is how have uh you brought the elected members of council on board with the management of uh of the risks of climate risk it 's pretty easy to uh to accept the risk when you live in a coastal environment that has 32 beaches to deal with and we 've seen over the course of the last couple of years particularly with tropical cyclone debbie where two of our major beaches have lost significant traps of the beach and therefore the beach front the coastal zone environment and where a couple of bits of our infrastructure fell into the water mainly in toilet box and things like that but when you have a look at even at mcewen 's beach where you know there was a question on the kuwan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front row of houses of mcewens beach if you look at that environment over the past 25 to 30 years there 's been 70 metres of that beachfront disappear including a council road so when you study all of those beach fronts and you look at the risk to public infrastructure it 's quite easy to to cement the that issue of a risk with the elected members of council because you know i think it 's quite plain for us to see as a coastal community if we if we were to start this from a greenfield site again this community we would not be building on the coast because we have beaches that are growing each year we have beaches that uh put on you know 10 or 20 metres a year but a lot of our beaches that have urban populations on them now are being eaten into year after year each cycle that we get so the beach community at mitch point you know they wouldn 't like to hear this but our next issue with mitchum point we 've just spent about three million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyclone issue at uh at mitch point if it 's the same impact as the last one will see us probably suggesting retreat as uh as one of the issues that uh we we need to deal with that with that community because how much public money do you intend to put into the recovery of some of these communities before you draw the line and say okay we need to we need to retreat and so yes this is uh we didn 't have to drag the elected members uh on this journey it is evident to us and every time we get a cyclone and massive cyclonic activity which produces um huge title activity on our beachfronts it is only too evident for us to see what the impact is and what the public money cost is to restoring or halting some of the future impacts thanks council williamson if there 's any more questions we 're happy to stay online we 're also happy if you wanted to get in contact with um with council to answer any questions because it 's always good to share our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way continual improvement and to be better and to support our community so that we are a vibrant community going forward unless there 's any further further ah there is one more question i might just hand that back over to robin and then i 'll then i 'll wrap it up if you don 't if you don 't mind thank you and the last one so what a policy of retreat from enterpoint resulting compensation or almost undoubtedly yes but having you know just spent in the order of three million dollars trying to recover a beach scarp which involved the underlying of about 900 meters of sandbag wall and then recovering the scarf over the top with the re-vegetation of the scar over the top of that sandbag wall which may last until the next huge cyclone so we 've got a category four or category cyclone at midpoint direct and that would all be gone anyway so how much money how much public money do you spend there 's probably a dozen um there might be more than a dozen but then say up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of legitimate public expenditure and and you know realistic public expenditure how many cyclones do we have to go through before we say to the first-round houses okay we 're going to buy you out now at the agreed price and retreat and so that 's you know that 's a logical question that both the state government and local government have to face because you know it 's rate payers or taxpayers money that goes into all of this and the recovery after each cyclonic event and there will come a time in the future i don 't know when it will be but if we were to get another category four or worst case on our category 5 cyclone that affected that beach directly i 'm sure even now we would have waves crashing into the front bedrooms or the houses on that front street so so it would make it a no later than in terms of the public expenditure under category d or even category e funding for for the state federal government 's cyclone recovery program let 's get out of there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're doing works so that 's a consideration when we 're i suppose um progress in our our plans and local plans for the for the different beach communities i might also say robert when we have this picture on everybody 's screen yes okay so when you can see the pioneer river moving around to the left of your picture there i think we 've just been through recently some of the properties there on that left left-hand bend just before the first bridge you see there um we 've been through a lot of a lot of work around that bed and then up on the next bed before the next um bridge crossing we 'll probably even have to resume a couple of those blocks of land because just before the that last bridge crossing there in the cyclone of 1956 it took out a whole community on the left-hand side on the left-hand bank which is the northern bank of the river as we 're looking at it now there 's a few remnant properties there that will probably have to be resumed uh sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those sorts of issues in a coastal community thanks councillor williamson thank you thank you so much to to the both of you for that presentation um and thank you everybody for for coming along to this webinar um i 'm going to wrap it up here and um just quickly talk about uh the next one uh webinar that we have in a fortnight 's time so we 're going back to community engagement and we 're um with a presentation by simon niemau who is an associate professor and co-founder of the center for deliberative democracy and global governance at the university of canberra his research ties together the themes of political behaviour the public sphere and observations from deliberative many republics such as citizen juries so obviously uh community engagement is one of the most challenging aspects of climate change that comes up time and time again for local government so despite being an important societal challenge the public engagement with climate change currently remains extremely difficult so we 'll just be focusing in on that and discussing how just processes and outcome outcomes in adaptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come along in a fortnight 's time and i look forward to doing that with you that time and tuning in with simon thank you everybody and thank you robin once again in council williamson thank you thank you

meeting of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the meeting and is ten o 'clock for the record council acknowledges and shows respect to the traditional owners of the land in which we gather today and I personally would like to pay my respects to their elders past and emerging so welcome everybody to the 2020 term we are in our fourth term six amalgamation I would Sunday regional council I 'd like to welcome the new counselors so I think of ladies first council all right well alphabetical order and counselor gravity [Applause] and counselor gary simpson although we are returning counselors ladies first together hope counselor Jang perfect a counselor Michael Branca and counselor John Collins let 's form a team together guys and let 's make it happen so this is so the new counselors this is our statutory meaning which is a small meeting and the reason we do have a smaller meeting is because after we have this meeting you can 't actually do it until you get sworn in so neither sworn in then there 'll be some training and a governance team will take you through the rights and responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then do before our ordinary council meeting which will be next Wednesday so that 's when we 'll actually be starting the ordinary council meeting and doing all the items of business for those who 've been are in the room before you can see do the coab of 19 restrictions we 're keeping our distance between people and we 've got our directors who 's normally sitting at the table in the back benches at this present point in time circle cheese we 're doing exactly what we can do then for the purpose of openness we are live-streaming this meeting so be aware of that hi do you guys at home welcome I ask that everyone be easy and home works with us a little bit here it might be a little bit clunky we 'll see here we go because we are using all their own council resources to make this happen because I 'm very very conscious of the fact that money is certainly going to be tight so we don 't want to go out spend a gazillion dollars on a lot of lyt things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air we try to do things as much as what we possibly can editing open so I 'm really strong on being open and transparent at the end of the day we need to share as much information as what we can 't with the public with the community after all they are our bosses they pay our wages so for those who are in the table who don 't think that there will be no shortage of people who will remind you the Declaration of office that you 've taken here this is a very very serious document and if you actually read it take a lot of notice of it which you should do your pledging here to look after the whole of the region so that 's the whole of the Whitsunday region even though you 're voted into the vision it 's all about the region not just your division what I encourage people to do is vote on the issue what I call vote on the issues as it comes across the desk or comes across the boardroom table if you believe it 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody within the community support it if you don 't if you don 't feel that way vote it down that 's what they encourage everybody to do we also encourage free and open debate have the discussion I 'll call it Fortuna against the motion so you can get up and you can speak for the motion you can speak to the motion so you can make general comments about the motion or you can speak against the motion how we 've been running the meetings is we don 't just let allow in one person to have a chat for and then against it 's open discussion what I ask though is that when those open debates are on we look at the subject we talk about the issue you play the subject the issue not the man or lady all right always always it must be respectful if you 're not sure about things ask the questions there 's no such thing as a silly question ask the question we 've got a very experienced acting CEO here there 's also a director of corporate if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've also got experts in all our fields so we 've got directors of engineering you 've got planning we 've got corporate we 've got community environment so we have experts at their fingertips we even have a league a legal advice that we can ask so if you 're not sure please ask the question counselors we are in unprecedented times we 've never had a world pandemic like this before but we need to do the hard work we need to lead it leading our community yeah of its predicament so encourage everybody to work together for the benefit of the whole of whitsunday region for those few words let 's get on with the job thank you [Applause] first item is apologies of which there aren 't any or counselors are in attendance and I thank them for doing so second item is condolences there is a recommendation mood counselors hoovered second counselor columns all those in favor of the condolences of Nations can 7-0 could I please ask everybody to be upstanding and observe one minute 's silence and acknowledgement of the recently deceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Music] move on the iron tree office of the mayor and CEO higher than 3.1 the Declaration of office there is a recommendation from our offices because I 'm somebody move on the recommendation move counselor Bronco stick of the Council of columns what I would like to do because we normally do this all together I 'd like everybody to be upstanding and in good faith just say the declaration of office together so have this is part of our official council meeting so a you comfortable CEO we just read this in your honor you don 't have to go through it so all together nice yeah well just it is what it is so everybody does know like okay so what would be good here is if we could end up getting in unison by the time we get to that and play but let 's give it a cracker like this is their first time together we 'll see there we go okay let 's start i Andrew Collins having thank you counselors please be seated purposes masonry so for those watching at home the declarations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr. Jason Bradshaw before this started at 15 so we have a motion that 's been moved and seconded would anybody like to speak for to her against the motion I 'll put the motion those in favor the motion is carried 7-0 thank you moving on to item 3.2 the appointment of deputy mayor sure to the act we need to have a motion if everyone read their papers there was different options footboard do I have a motion please for the deputy mayor against the Branka it 's now I just like to move that we have a rotational deputy meth starting with Council of Collins and that it be reviewed every year as the tests that have been reviewed in April we care and better tailored to vision yeah so that 's an option three yeah do I have a seconder for the motion yeah I 'll second it councillor Collins so have a movement a second would you like speak you motion councillor bunker or oh yes mr. mee this is the report says Oh counselor Carl this is cancelled Brandon 's motion he 's starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to four do you want to put you want to put other people in as you go where you want to book you know you speak to when Marx finished sure see mr. Muir the intended emotion was just to be rotated north and south each year it 's voluntary for those who want it obviously there 's some new counselors here that I feel up to when they 're nominated they don 't have to stay it 'll be on a volunteer basis the the reason for rotating it obviously gives other long-standing counselors an opportunity to be deputy mayor as well so that was the reasoning behind that so that 's what I 've been a rotational basis Thank You counsel Bronco counselor Collins I just I 'm just looking at considering the current situation with the cave at 19 I agree with the Rockies idiot in 12 months time you know if we 're in a dire situation that we 're just going to willy-nilly change and all that sort of stuff we just need to review it as we go along and that 's one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reviewed every year like the motion to relive unit rotation or just reviewed all right it 'll be rotated more emotional Sarah Palin no one accepts a nomination well notice that that clearly articulated okay we have a motion with anybody else like to speak for two against the motion canceled a rally yes my thing this I think it 's an opportunity to give the existing councils an opportunity to step up and I think for the rest of us still joining as new councils of use as a chance to learn from you guys and probably say different management skills than leadership skills from there the various deputies particularly if you are able to the president a meeting or all your being represented as a region style just to comment more than in so I support the idea of rotating mean I 'd like to see the existing counselors at from the previous term to be considered in that rotational basis on the first if the motion did need to say that I 'm not sure but that was that I think the experience that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that the communities behind them thank you thank you councillor grandi councillor Simpson would you like speak thanks I 'd like to move margin in support of council of Collins to continue on us cancer Simpson you can 't do that this president wouldn 't all we have to deal with this motion what you could do if you wanted to you could foreshadow a motion if this motion was going to be then voted down that you could then speak to what you could push shadow oh poor shadow so what would you for shadow council Simpson that council of cones phenom night to be deputy mayor and continued with uncertain times that we 're facing I think it 's imperative that we as a council move forward with the strongest team we 've got and that Bank is for the full term okay thank you would anybody else like to speak for against the motion okay I 'll put the motion those in favor those against I am this is just a motion against the Simpson so you buy the both a vote for it or against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor the motion is carried sitting zero thank you moving on okay back in CEO said so therefore the core shadow motion because that one was successful drops a lot okay you item three point three years on three point three the council meeting scheduled mood counselor Clifton second it counselor Collins today boy like speak for two council columns to be the schedule of meetings in Proserpine mayor and the at this stage and it 's not open are we going to get the user facility well it 's unopened or we have to find elsewhere I believe not originally we had this thirtieth of mine in postponed but we didn 't have if that venue wasn 't available so we thought we 'd slaughter here they can devour one into have one day on the south and then by then hopefully there might be some movement on that community center and if there 's not or tennis club because the other one we was thinking of was upstairs to the RSL oh yeah but I the wrong room we just thought we do that and buy ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we end up with this code nothing but X which would someone if you could destroy the magma their audience in recess club but there 's to be another good one as well cancer Simpson thanks and Wilcox am I just like that purpose of a real Isis is for the rest the reminder of five 2020 that I 'd like to see more meetings it 's possible like look forward to the Gloucester Sport and Recreation Center or maybe try and squeeze out the columns for one in if we can I think it 's important that we get out and on be out in the community thank you there is two colorful ones in there at the moment so what we also do councillor Simpson is so these are our they are ordinary council meetings which we try to have within our council chamber so we have that 's why we have council chambers but what we do have is then have cubed what we call community ketchups for those other times where we can go out and we 've done that throughout the whole region go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can they can come forward in an informal setting yes yep I guess what Bradley does this some wing say we would go out to Collins Hill then would we would we tie that up with a community catch up at that point while we 're out there for the meeting or do they become separate events so that we might possibly if we 're going to travel to Collins Phil it 's the best way to do it exactly so it 's exactly what we normally do we have people are earlier to come through the tonight the meeting so they can come and see how we do to earn your business in then we invite people afterwards to have the conversation and also what we do sometimes as we might have something that we actually don 't have a look at hmm as well or something that was the other thing that we need to do to clear with all the new counselors and once we sort this Cove opinion is to be able to jump on a bus for go and have a look at all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what 's happening across the whole the Whitsunday region what 's a council Simpson sorry what you could do if you you could move an amendment to that motion if you wanted to do that for you yeah thanks Mia but only the death stands but because this is only to the reminder to 20 maybe we look at it in the next year to 21 yeah so there 's a great facility at Gloucester and I think it should be utilized more regularly and opportunity for people tonight making the Worcester and making councilors and get involved get Sbrocco to me I think what what counsel Simpson is saying is taken up usually we have briefing sessions there as well so these are just this Cricket Council meetings in the off off Wednesday we have briefing sessions as well and the briefing sessions are usually to the small remote communities because not taking all that technical aids as of a council meeting so the briefing sessions are a lot more informal and that 's when we get a cluster bingo having little small halls Conway I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's move counsel second counselor Branca this report was originally written by our then cm to the king Donahoe and this is appointment but as you don 't know we 're at the moment recruiting for a CEO so what will end up happening is the recruiter will provide a short list and then we will have that discussion as counselors so the CEO is the only person that counsel as a collective being employed all the other employees look under the CEO yeah cancel right so there might be a to be proven at this one I 'm just a little bit concerned everyone say between jockstrap appointment and if we sort of Irving and we 've got you know people acting CEO you know is it worthwhile just putting down on par in my opinion no but you could you can put a motion up to that effect of the ordinary council meeting because the CEO is such an important part of the whole organization they actually what happens is the council laws here have to decide the strategic intent so of what they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that no acting CEO is also a director of corporate services so if we didn 't recruit for his position if he was then staying on there longer we would then have to recruit to his position so we have to do we have to do that anyway and we really need the bit down the CEO as soon as what will possibly can to get some stability back in the organisation thank you cancel a lot is there restrictions on what that can see I can do so you sure when a person is acting in a role they have all the Paris pictures unless we used to impose this occasion okay jessa grounded thank you me yeah I 'd support in the time of crisis we actually made a strong CEO and and possibly at the moment that it could be good timing because it could be strong CEO 's that are seeking employment so say yes let 's get that position filled and that 's based on these previous experience really not feel CEO positions in roles that I 've been in own and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support filling the CEO position that we received the same manner as we did last time we 're all counselors were invited to the interview because it 's the only job we get to say anything about and I thought it was very high yeah in my mind will be exactly the same as the last time I think it 's important that just also for the new counselors as a counselor you 're in total of all the information from the whole of the organization so whatever you want to know there 's any any given time just don 't be afraid to ask we 'll go over that afterwards with what you can do and my intention is yes and even you see the short lists the whole lot and then be part of the process I think we 'll do it exactly the same as what we did the last time everybody gets its the see exactly but probably just have that here we did last time with the deputy myself and asking the questions and then at the end because with seven people at the but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions that you 've had I think I think that 's the way to do it yeah I thought it worked really well last time it was very interesting very enlightening thank you it certainly wasn 't my intention to be going out for a new CEO so quickly elections yeah okay so great questions anybody else any questions or anyone like to speak for two against the motion so norman was a as previously I 've experienced as well so I have got lots of experience here she went if you ask any questions back oh nothing further well I 'll put the motion agent over the motion is carried 7-0 did I ask you I can see you later then please any other director of engineering [Music] [Applause] congratulations congratulations again I can 't take your hand because as it is between you being inaptly what is there acting I think chief executive officers currently well done in the words of spider-man the great power comes great responsibility sir yes okay that brings an end to the meeting what I encourage everybody to do is we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll encourage our directors to meet the new counselors hope I can I can I propose a memo good ok so what am i clear before we 've got time on your live stream with that ok ok so what I 'll do is I just go around have directors so for those who haven 't obviously everyone met our acting chief executive officer mr. Jason Bradshaw at the induction and he 's also our director of corporate headed a table here we 've got our director of engineering mr. Matt Fanning we 've got director of planning deals the game TV we 've got director Julia right community environment I was here assistant director Adams sister director of engineering and what projects respondent does lower their project and one missing one table ok a gnome who normally you all right thank you can 't lose counselors will you,"(-20.4018362, 148.5832116)"
AUS,QLD,Whitsunday Regional Council,Whitsunday Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp2KXCWMXIgmDYxRg4lVpxg,WCCIH _ Webinar – Ian Edwards _ Climate Change and Finance,VrD3kgvmwy8,20210106,2853.599,"Proserpine QLD 4800, Australia",7562,and we 're interested in exploring real world challenges make the most of quite a changed um changed environment and you know that it will affect us across all levels of government all sectors of society and the border community as a whole um our webinars are organized in a fairly structured way um so participants can engage in a new topic with a climate change expert every every fortnight and some descriptions are across the whole organization so there are great opportunities for um we 're fairly new to the webinars then a couple of months ago we weren 't 100 sure how they 'd be received we just had a hunch that councils um might be willing to engage and if we may have something that is is a value you know our perception and and our ability to do people um is constrained by the newness of their organization and so as a result i really would encourage um everyone who 's um taking part in this webinar today to give us some feedback on what we 're trying to do um help us generate ideas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to participate so even though we 're running webinars in terms of today 's question um we 've got ian edwards uh on who um won this webinar about finance um the driver behind ian 's um effectively to adapt to climate change that we must work out how many by the private sector can be tapped into to help achieve that private sector capital is not freely given um and capital is very much interested in what 's in it for me question so where 's the profit and so there 's a real challenge in this space of moving thinking from the climate adaptation needs funding to answering questions how to finance um client adaptation so the objective in this webinar is to look at that relationship between funding and finance particularly in the context of local government and ultimately at how each of the um and how councils can use that to enhance their capacity to manage climate change uh we 're not going to run through details about all different financing mechanisms space but i 'm sorry and we 'll have he specializes in climate adaptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptation to private sector i 'll admit to being completely bamboozled by that quite that life he 's worked with a wide range of industries including public practice investment banking and reinforced um his careers focused predominantly on affecting systems change at multinational scale and this has given the great insight across a range of areas in analytical financial information technology management skills recently completed a master 's dissertation um and his research explores the viability of risk transfer mechanisms within the context of local governments i think um means recent research might be particularly um useful to most people on the webinar today uh thanks a lot rod uh i really do need to update that bio things have moved on a lot since then the other masters was actually finished about four years ago um and i 've been involved in a lot of differing sort of projects and initiatives since then but yeah i certainly do have a strong interest in insurance and alternative risk transfer mechanisms to insurance and i know i think sophie from cairns actually provided some questions in advance to ian morrison around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm not really looking at insurance per se in this presentation what i wanted to do was i wanted to look at more the debt side of financing and and also how um the relationship between financing and funding to basically enable adaptation activities and the capital and whatnot that 's required for that but listen um yeah thanks rod thanks for the introduction i much appreciate it i think everyone knows enough about me and i 've had a little bit of a spiel there but just before i start can i ask that people submit questions in the chat line down the right hand corner as we go i 've got quite a lot to cover and i 'll look to answer those those questions at the end and for the questions that we 've received in advance i think i will cover most of those but if i don 't other than the insurance i 'm sorry to say but if i don 't please please let me know and i 'll certainly address them at the end now listen a quick caveat around adaptation finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private sector is really just getting on board with what adaptation is and how they may get involved so there 's not a great deal of understanding out there of what it is and what it means so i guess what i 'm trying to say is i will certainly talk about adaptation finance today but what i would like to do is i would like to broaden the discussion and consider the drivers of affordable finance and also the drivers that can enable funding so i want to look at the relationship between funding and financing from a local government perspective anyway to do that i 'd like to start with um oh what 's going on here some some key concepts the first concept is is the concept of expenditure and the reason i 'm telling you this is to lay some background so when we when i sort of move into some other topics later on we 're all on the same page so excuse me if i 'm if i 'm if i 'm pitching too late but this is important stuff now if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it 's certainly we 're gonna have to pay for it one way or another and adaptation activities are quite broad um we will we potentially have adaptation around the the asset or the the plan and equipment space so for example we might want to build uh some sort of sea wall now that 's typically considered something along the lines of capital expenditure and that 's where we 're essentially we 've got a big chunk of money generally on a one-off or something like a one-off basis where we 're acquiring something and we expect the services from that something that we acquire to be provided across a long period of time on the flip side we 've also got what we call operational expansion that might fit into adaptation where for example we want to engage a climate coordinator or something along those sort of lines or it might even be additional repairs because of the stresses of um you know extreme weather on our asset base so the thing about operational expenditure that 's a little bit different to capital expenditure it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're paid periodic at periodic times so we 've got capital expenditure we 've got operational expansion the the definite relationship between both is we need to find monies to enable us to make that expenditure so you know the big thing here is expenditure equals dollars now why am i telling you this um if we look at expenditures we you know this this slide that i 've got on the on the on the screen here this this purple box of expenditure we 've got this distinction between funding and finance so if i can distinguish between the two and the way they 'll be using the terms in this particular webinar funding is essentially the provision of monies with no expectation of repayment so from a local government perspective it can be all sorts of things it could be federal grants interest fines and the biggest one across the local government in australia is what 's known as own source revenue which incorporates your rates and your user charges so you 're receiving monies potentially in because you have provided a service but there is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've received now that if we compare that to financing financing is very different financing we receive money but there is an expectation of repayment and beyond that expectation of repayment there 's also an expectation of some sort of compensation so if we look at a loan as a classic example of financing i 'm paid principal when i repay that loan i also repay interest and that interest is that compensate compensatory element now the predominant sources of financing for local government well i 'd have to say local government in queensland it really is just um a qtc the queensland treasury corporation but the other source that 's available out there is the commercial banks so i just want to quickly this diagram here i just want to make it very clear that you know financing is no silver bullet the other relationship between financing and funding is financing as i said before has to be repaid back and the only way the local government can repay that financing back is through their funding stream so that 's an important element ultimately you need to pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts with one other element here and that is the cost of financing so as i mentioned before there is this compensatory element that 's included in or an expectation in financing and there are a number of things that drive that and these things that drive it are important because they 'll determine essentially how much or the level of that compensatory element so let 's talk about um interest again and alone essentially when we 're talking about finance quite simply the greater the risk the more compensation will be demanded and if we 're talking about a loan we 're specifically talking about something like credit risk or it 's also known as counterparty risk and that is the risk that the borrower will not repay the lender when the monies are due so the the higher the risk that that that will occur the more interest for example that will be demanded by the lender the other interesting part is the novelty and the complexity of the mechanism the thing about and a lot of people don 't realize this but think about the financial sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible and if we talk about financing mechanisms for example i was once asked to put together a typology of financing mechanisms and be honest that 's almost a possibility it 's almost like how long is a piece of string because the financing sector can essentially structure a mechanism to meet any requirements now when we think of financing we often think of you know loans or insurance which are very vanilla standard sort of mechanisms but if you get the structured financing people involved they can do anything now what that means is or the important distinction about around that is the more novel and the more complex a mechanism is the more it 's going to cost you and that 's something you might want to consider if for example if you 're starting to sort of think down the lines of some funky innovative financing mechanisms they 're probably going to cost you more so let 's talk about resourcing adaptation and a lot of what i 'm about to show you is is my view so i also want to caveat that this this webinar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i 've i 've done for a number of clients where i actually have looked at at adaptation finance but the the big take home for me right from the start is as we know climate change it 's it 's the mother of all pervasive risk it its scale and its scope it can pretty well impact everything and i think if you want to look at finance or if you want to look at how you resource certain activities you need to start with funding certainly in the local government space so i want to use queensland as an example so if we look at the if we look at funding sources and the way that that 's regulated in queensland for local governments essentially will certainly own source uh revenue as i mentioned before being potentially or predominantly rates and user charges is regulated by the local government act and the relevant regulations now with respect to how they those rates or those user charges can be set there are a number of principles which are provided and need to be applied now the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words to able the council to maintain its financial infrastructure capital over the long term and over long term means basically at least 10 years so beyond 10 years so what it means is principles are all about ensuring that when we set the level of rates as an example we 're thinking in the long term and we 're trying to determine how much we need and how to apply that to levels of rates so you know the main ones i want to concentrate on here and i 'll be very quick with this is rates practice principles so fairness equity meaningful contribution predictability and user pays now with climate change we know that climate change is going to impact or it 's going to cost us more into the future so i guess these principles to me are a compelling reason to ensure that we are incorporating and we 're trying to understand what the implications of climate change to our operations and our capital bases as soon as we possibly can and i guess what i 'm trying to say is these principles to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really start looking at risk managing climate change and incorporating that risk management process as deep as we can in our processes so that means that the impacts of climate change will flow through to our forecasting and our projections and they can help meet these principles as an example i think a classic is predictability predictability is all about ensuring that when we set our rates not bouncing all over the place and our and our rate payers have an understanding or have a relative um confidence that they 'll be able to meet those rates so they know what they 're going to be the earlier that we can incorporate the impacts of climate change into our projections the smaller those changes can be and the more we can smooth them over time so as an example if we expect i don 't talk about a sea wall again to fail in 15 years as opposed to 30 years we can essentially incorporate the additional price of that 15 year replacement in 15 years time right now and we can smooth it out across our rate space if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a blip a special levy or we 're going to have to go out and and find finance to do exactly that so that 's my big first take home okay let 's get on to financing adaptation now when i was asked to look at climate adaptation financing to be honest i was really quite amused um because i thought to myself well how is climate adaptation financing or how is ada how is financing adaptation activities any different to financing any other activities if i 've got a c wall and i was going to build it to five meters but now i 'm going to build it to 10 in respect to the finance that i 'm seeking does that really make any difference i 'm really just going and asking for a bigger amount but as i hunted around and sort of dug into this space it became quite apparent to me that there actually there is a good reason to brand any initiatives that you 're undertaking in the adaptation space as adaptation and that 's because of what we 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the growth in what 's called sustainable finance and as you can see from 2007 around sustainable finances 1.5 billion sustainable finance issue globally in 2018 that was almost 250 billion dollars that is a significant exponential increase and what this is showing is showing that there is a demand amongst investors and financing financiers out there to finance sustainable initiatives and of course climate change adaptation certainly fits the bill it is a finance initiative if we bring it closer to home queensland victoria and new south wales have all issued in the last three years what are known as green or slash climate bonds and they are an integral part of sustainable finance indeed tcorp which is the new south wales government 's treasury corporation their uh green bond was subscribed to 1.8 billion so they raised 1.8 billion dollars but 2.4 billion dollars was actually subscribed so in other words it was 0.6 billion that actually wasn 't wasn 't needed so there 's there 's great demand out there the other thing is all the big four banks all have right now policies around how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're actually putting money aside and saying look this bucket here we want that to go towards climate change or we want to go towards sustainable solutions excuse me now why is that important because if you 're looking to finance an adaptation initiative then really if you can brand it as finance then you 're essentially positioning yourself where you can access finance which is not available to other initiatives so for example if you know you 're out there and you 're basically building a um a dog park then you know what i 'm trying to show on this slide here is you know that 's a generic type activity you can access traditional finance to do that i mean not that you would but you certainly can 't access climate or ethical finance but if you can if you 're doing something which you can brand as adaptation and it 's accepted as such it opens up this whole new path of finance to you the thing about the thing i should have mentioned actually around ethical sustainable and climate financing is it is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example um the bomb that was issued by the queensland government pretty sure was a climate bond was issued pursuant to the standards of what 's known as the climate bond initiative it 's a climate bond standard and it 's quite prescriptive and it does allow for um mitigation initiatives and climate change adaptation initiatives but if you 're out there building that um that dog park well then no you you 're not going to pick up this sort of finance excuse me the next thing i wanted to talk about and i think sophie i 'm hoping this might cover one of your questions is around okay i mentioned before around the compensatory element of finance and how much you actually pay for finance and one of the main drivers of that is risk now right now i can pretty confidently say the climate risk is not really impacting how much organizations pay to access finance but i think there are a number of significant trends in the private sector which are going to change that dynamic very very soon and and i mean it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wanted to take you through that because this is important to understand that if you 're looking to access finance at any point from the commercial sector and this even applies to someone like um qtc who you probably access your finance from now but they 're going to be under the same sort of ring if they 're going out to the market for their finance these are the sort of powers that are starting to play so i 'd like to start in the in the bottom right hand corner if i can and what i 've got there is i 've i 've got the regulators the the financial and economic regulators of this country so we 've got asic the australian securities and investments commission we 've got apra which is the australian prudential regulation authority they 're the guys who are responsible for regulating the financial instrument and then we 've got the reserve bank of australia now in the last three years and certainly increasingly so over the last couple of months all of these institutions have released strong statements around their concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability of the country and the broader economic a broader economy in general and if you look at asic for example asic and actually apra also have released statements saying that we will look very closely at those organizations that we regulate to give to give us confidence that they are one taking climate risk seriously and two where relevant they are managing that risk so in other words if we look at that if we look at those corporations or those organizations sitting in the in the circle in the middle we 've got the big four banks and we 've got the big insurers in australia they are all receiving pressure from the regulators to be looking and managing climate risk the next pathway of pressure if you look at the next pressure point is from the top right hand corner and that 's the investors so the investors the investors being the likes of uh local government super for example i think is a classic example and conglomerations of investors like the investor group on on climate change have come to the realization that climate change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive from their investments so they are putting pressure on those that they invest in to ensure that they are managing climate risk and that they can show that they are managing climate risk so for example if i 'm local government super um and i 'm tossing up whether i 'm going to invest in anz or nab nab has a great policy around climate risk they 've done a lot of really good work it 's obviously managing that risk really nicely and anz don 't even acknowledge the risk exists at all my money 's going to go to nab now that once again is a great motivator and incentive for the financiers of this country and this is right across the globe by the way to take this seriously now the third element that i quickly want to talk about is up in the top left hand corner that 's the task force on climate-related financial disclosures that was a task force that was initiated by mark carney who 's the head of the financial stability board the g20 financial stability board just after the conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tcfd as it 's known is all around providing a framework to enable corporations to disclose once one their exposure to climate risk but also how they are managing that disclosure so what we 've got is we 've got these requirements on the right hand side you know around return and systemic risk but on the left-hand side we 've now got the framework that enables that prior to the tcfd i think the issue is paid the initial newspaper that was released identified i think it was like 400 frameworks that could be applied to climate change disclosure and all that was really doing was creating a lot of obfuscation confusion the tcfd creates a level standardized playing field which enables investors to basically compare between differing organizations in respect to how they are managing their climate risk now the fourth one is this mild-mannered chap down in the left-hand corner that 's a fellow by the name of noel hutley now noel hutley is a queen 's council and he released an advice back in 2016 which has recently been updated a couple of months ago around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change and essentially his advice is this if you 're a border if you sit on a board of directors and you don 't understand what the impact of climate change is for your organisation and you 're not generating the governance and the risk management systems that ensure that that risk will be managed appropriately you are not fulfilling your fiduciary responsibility as a director and you hold yourself out personally so this is not the corporation this is you personally for negligence torturous legal action in the future now if i 'm a director that 's last thing i want to do so what i 'm trying to say is these four pressures are putting a lot of pressure and a lot of incentive and a lot of motivation on the finances of this country to look at climate risk now if i 'm a financier and i 'm going to look at climate risk the climate risk that i hold is predominantly assumed by the clients that i deal with so what this means is and this is the bottom little arrow pointing down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i am if i 'm a nz and i 'm going to provide a 30-year mortgage to an individual before i provide that mortgage there is incentive now for me to understand what that particular house is going to be like in the next 5 10 15 20 whatever years is it going to be increasingly exposed to extreme weather events is this going to degrade the quality of the asset so there 's there is an incentive to look at the organizations and the people that i 'm lending to so that i just wanted to sort of raise because this this this is coming uh the main barrier to this at the moment really is is technical and its capacity um but the banks and the insurers are all working on that um and as i say this this is moving so so quickly it really is only a matter of time that the finances in this country will be taking a very close lens to climate change risk when they 're assessing whether they 'll lend or whether they 'll insure so i think i 've bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specifically a an adaptation finance presentation but i just wanted to join the dots because really what i 'm trying to do is i 'm trying to make a case for the inclusion in climate risk management as deep as it possibly can be within local government processes and that 's because as i showed in the funding it has the sooner you can incorporate that the sooner it has the potential to provide a positive influence on how you set your own source funding the more you the sooner you can incorporate climate risk management if you can show the insurers and the lenders that you are managing this risk then by all intensive purposes that really should reduce the risk to them which should reduce the price that you are paying as i say it 's not happening right now but the trends are all moving and pushing very very much in one direction in closing the only other thing that i 've done there is i 've drawn the arrows in all different directions the blue arrows and that 's because everything is related quite often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access debt to enable you to create a capital spend to enable insurance and depending on how you manage your funding that will drive the size of your funding debt and potentially how much financing you need to go and access so listen so i 'd like to close the formal presentation at that point i 'm just going to see if i can have a look at the let 's have a look what questions we 've received here i think they 'll pop up here will banks be less likely to lend money for investments in coastal hazard areas i mean that 's that 's that 's come from for me and um well yeah i i honestly think they will um if if we look at the the trends that i just mentioned now those coastal areas which are exposed to climate risk and don 't have any mitigating elements that reduce that exposure i would imagine that there will certainly be an incentive to look very very closely and i mean the money may come but i think the real potential is is that the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could um could increase a lot to a point where quite frankly the um the finance would become for all intensive purposes unaffordable anyway um okay i 'll just see if i 've got any other questions here sorry and something 's happening with the with the question list that 's not um you might have to go there uh i 'll jump in a lot of the questions look like they come are coming from me but actually they were submitted in advance thank you to everybody who who did that um in advance you know do you want to just ask me the question because i 'm having trouble getting it there yeah absolutely um what questions can the cfo be expected to be asked or should be asking themselves in the next 1 5 10 years of that financial planning horizon that you mentioned um well i think it harks back to to the slides um if we 're talking specific to climate change i mean climate change is is just another factor that needs to be taken into incorporation taken into consideration when we 're considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlay um so i would think you know if we 're talking around climate it 's it 's that it 's um what impact is it going to have on my capital base you know um do i need to increase my my operational expenditure um to incorporate adaptation activities the other thing is i mean the sooner you do that the sooner you can actually look for uh for opportunities and ways that you can actually reduce that expenditure but the first thing is to actually understand as best as you can and don 't get me wrong climate change provides an uncertain environment but that 's what a risk is that 's how you manage risks it 's about understanding what the potential implications are and then applying appropriate remedies to those particular implications but the starting point is okay what right now do we consider the impacts to be okay so i suppose that leads into the the next question about labeling and branding these activities as that 's a good question and to be honest it 's a question that is probably specific to the um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage with um but if because i mean there are there are different standards out there that have differing requirements adaptation if if we look at the um the climate bond standard as an example a lot of the climate bond standard which has been used as part of the uh which sorry which was utilized by the queensland government when they issued their climate bond a lot of the climate bond standard at this point in time is mitigation heavy so there 's a lot of information there around our projects that are relevant but more around the renewable energy space and reducing greenhouse gases and things like that certainly um adaptation activities are included but there 's not a lot of guidance but i mean that 's about to change there is guidance to be uh released for public comment in june this year so we 'll get a better idea about that as as we go yeah and i suppose this is the follow-on to to that one of do you see this labeling as related or different to the existing betterment works eg disaster prep mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different name onto the same activity um well i think they 're the same i think where the guidance will be quite helpful is if there 's if there is a test around uh proportion some sort of proportional test so um you know if you 're going to build a sea wall but now you 're building it 50 higher than you were before does that mean that does that make the whole initiative an adaptation initiative or does it make it a 50 adaptation initiative in a 50 i don 't know just generic initiative that i can 't answer them as i say i 'm sort of looking forward to seeing these um these guidelines in june have a bit of a better idea okay okay and looking for more the investment side of it um in terms of lending money uh will banks be less likely to lend money for investments in coastal hazard areas or area yeah this this this one i responded to at the starting and i think so we 've covered that yeah they 're bouncing all over the place i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was that because we 've got a couple of minutes maybe i can i can address that um yep i think what about so so what are the currency implications for properties in climate hazard areas do you think do you see insurance as changing significantly over the next five or ten years the local government especially um well i think the insurance implications are potentially significant i mean we 've already seen uh significant increases in insurance i mean if you look at if you look at yassie and and larry and the impact on north queensland premiums you know back in um was that 2010 2011 i was overseas at the time but certainly um yeah there were significant increases in premiums subsequent to those events i mean to the point where you know the number of government inquiries that were set up like the uh i think it was a north australian insurance premium um i don 't know tribune or something along those sort of lines the the insurance industry has has had a consistent message around maintaining affordability of insurance and that is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mitigate the risk you know the insurance industry can 't do anything about the hazards and neither can you all you can really do is manage how exposed you are to those hazards and from a pure commercial sense you know premiums are what 's known as a as a pricing signal a premium reflects the risk that the insured event will actually occur so the greater the risk that insured event will occur the higher the premium so if there is a perception that particular areas are being whacked more than others or we 're seeing an increase in extreme tropical cyclone activity even those areas which may not have been directly impacted well the insurance premiums will go up because they are also tropical cyclone prone areas and really the only way to manage that is to mitigate that risk one way or another i mean even if you step back if you look at local governments in north queensland i actually looked at this i mean my masters was mentioned before i looked at the the impact of insurance on on a number of coastal councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after those events certain local governments are actually starting to underensure now you know the budget for your insurance premiums may remain consistent the way that you manage that is you uh you incur a greater excess so the amount that 's actually covered is less and i mean and and that 's already happening right now so yeah i think there are significant insurance implications for properties in climate hazard areas the only thing i would say with coastal areas is insurance doesn 't really cover coastal hazards per se like um acts of the sea so there 's no insurers out there right now that will cover you for erosion or storm tight inundation or anything along those lines certainly that i 'm not aware of that i 'm aware of yeah okay um really is one of those uh topics that i think we probably need a webinar in itself uh just to even touch on the surface um so hopefully we 'll we 'll be able to to get that moving um yeah i think the last question that we had like i know you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like to to talk about this one from logan city council about whether you 've got any examples of councils that are actually accessing green green bonds to fund projects or anything like that not in australia not in australia i think where i mean council 's in us it would be very very difficult for a council certainly in australia certainly in queensland to issue a green bond i mean really the predominant source of finance the local government in queensland i 'll use queensland as an example because that 's most of the work that i 've done um it 's the qtc it 's queensland treasury corp and that 's because qtc has a aaa credit rating it can access finance a lot cheaper than any individual council could so i mean that will be the natural part the other thing is uh if you 're a council and you want to go beyond the qtc beyond the beyond queensland treasury you need permission from the queensland treasure to do that and there 's the sbfa too many acronyms which is essentially the financing act for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though that if you want to access the process or the proceeds of green bonds so for example you know as i mentioned before the queensland government has already um issued a climate slash green bond and those monies are being applied to climate slash green initiatives as as as as is required um by the the bond um standard so if you want to access that sort of money then you know i mean that i would imagine that 's that 's potential and a possibility in the future i think um maybe the lgaq or um you know the the coastal or was it the um the ccat councils or something along those lines might want to start considering whether they want to bring that up with um with qtc and whether that 's potential form of funding in the future all right um sorry right on one last i 'm gonna i know that we 're we 're breaking our cardinal rule um well i mean well rob did speak for five minutes so if we want to give people the 440. i know that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the final question um or just issue of just your final point ian of what local governments should be doing right now to plan ahead financially from climate change and just coming back to that whether there 's any key point that you just really want to get well i think i think that the first thing is and i don 't know who 's who 's in the various rooms but the first thing is you need to get the cfo on board um you need to make it very clear that you know climate change it might be a an environmental issue but it has significant economic risks and i mean there are many ways you can do that i mean one of the ways is potentially the slide the second last slide that i showed which just shows how seriously the private sector and the australian financial regulators are taking this risk i mean that 's the first thing um so you need that that economic narrative that economic justification um i mean if you haven 't already created that and if the cfo 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing is you need to be understanding and and this i can 't answer and i mean don 't get me wrong this is this is not an easy ask but you 've got to start somewhere you really need to start understanding what the implications are of climate change for your operations and for your asset base once you understand that then you can cost it and then essentially you can incorporate the financial elements of what climate change is right now i mean as i mentioned before this is a risk there 's a lot of uncertainty but you know if it 's if that sea wall is going to degrade in 15 years as opposed to 20 but when you when you um when you put it in place you thought it was going to last for 30 well 15 is closer to 20. so you know essentially you 're updating your understanding as you go along as a new science evolves and you 're starting to incorporate that in your financial planning and really as i say you know that does more than enable you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then set your your own source revenue you know per the per the the other requisite principles and it also enables you to show beyond the beyond the benefits that you 're going to get from managing this risk in the first place to show other entities that you are managing that risk which could have and as i say i 'll be very surprised in the next couple of years if that doesn 't have implications on affordable insurance and debt whether that 's via qtc or whether as an example or whatever treasury body or whether that 's directly to the market all right that sounds like a a good uh ian um thank you very much for uh what i 've certainly found has been a very stimulating um presentation and um exploration of some of the um the issues that are associated with financial aspects adapting to climate change um our next um next webinar in our series is being held in uh in two weeks time we 'll be addressing uh community engagement aspects of climate adaptation uh certainly from the perspective of the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community engagement is where so much of the response to just about any uh i think it will be a very um valuable webinar to take part in uh i guess just before we close i would encourage um everyone who has been on today to really continue to engage with the lab we really do welcome um further questions and also particularly welcome any feedback on the webinar today and also any suggestions for topics that would be valuable to include in our program um going forward we are we are working through the process extending the series um as we add new topics so um i think there 's a lot of um a lot more interesting and valuable um material to come over over the coming months so well thank you um everyone for your participation uh thank you ian um for presenting uh and we hope to hear you um back on another of our webinars very,"(-20.4018362, 148.5832116)"

Tourism,j2AEeNZy4y0,20201110,2411.839,"Proserpine QLD 4800, Australia",6522,hello everybody i hope everybody can hear me okay we 're going to start this afternoon 's webinar um thank you for joining the title of today 's webinar is redesigning and redefining tourism and we 're looking at what 's happening in new zealand i 'm olivia brodhurst and i 'm the coordinator of the whitsunday climate change innovation hub the hub is an initiative of whitsunday regional council and looks to build the resilience of the whitsundays community and communities everywhere to climate change we are very lucky at the hub to be guided by a panel of experts including professor suzanne beckham suzanne is a professor in sustainable tourism at griffith university and is currently working for the new zealand government and living in new zealand she is incredibly well published with over 100 articles on sustainable tourism as you all know the kobe 19 pandemic has come as a huge shock to global tourism businesses and destinations have been forced to reinvent their offering and look at targeting different markets some of the impacts we are witnessing could be considered as an accelerated scenario of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today suzanne is going to share with us the approach that the new zealand government is taking by focusing on this as an opportunity to redefine tourism so that it is not only more sustainable but more resilient and delivers net benefits to destinations suzanne is going to provide approximately a 20-minute presentation at the end of the presentation we will have time for questions you can also type questions in the chat and please use the raising hand function if you want to ask a question otherwise we do ask if you could please keep your microphone on mute throughout the presentation we are recording the webinar and we are going to share a link with it with you afterwards if you also wouldn 't mind turning off your video that will probably help with the quality of the call as well so i will turn the uh presentation over now to suzanne beckham thank you olivia and good afternoon everyone it 's it 's good to kind of virtually join join you guys in queensland and and and see the lovely background in olivia 's picture makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to share my screen and all going well if i don 't hear any thing otherwise i assume it 's working olivia yes i assume it 's working so what what i 'm doing is i i will literally focus on new zealand but my very last slide will then transition to what does this mean for the whitsundays and i know that um many of you who are on the call actually really now queensland tourism very well at the great barrier reef so i 'm really hoping that we get a good discussion that we all find useful in thinking forward how to get out of this crisis in in the best way possible so the the official term in new zealand is actually reimagining and i didn 't want to overuse that so i called the presentation redesigning and redefining um and i might start just sort of to remind ourselves um really briefly back in time because it 's it 's not been that long in fact even still in january this year that it was sort of the land of plenty with tourism growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many tourism operators in some ways failed to innovate to work on their product because um just like in australia and the the growth rates in new zealand were about eight nine ten percent every year so so operators really didn 't have to do much um to essentially sell um their offerings and so now it turns out that there 's actually a lot of issues and the the image of the airport i put in to also remind ourselves how tourism has become a machine that potentially does not deliver any more on on the basic needs why people travel um and and we can go into that later but there 's again an opportunity to maybe redefine or remember what travel was about um and what kind of we have turned it into it has led to a whole lot of issues and i will really sort of run for those um they they all relate to some form of caring capacity and whether it 's sort of social community based or whether it 's environmental and the left photo here is for those people who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it seems there 's just far too many they are all parked up now um or rented out to domestic visitors at very cheap rides um but there 's obviously been an excessive um sort of expansion in into that type of travel the other one is in the famous example that most of you would know from thailand and often it has actually sort of rather than maybe environmental capacities it has exceeded south so the visitor experience capacity and this is a very famous um peak um that has made it on instagram and nobody knew it before to be honest um it 's just above like wanaka and you stand there you have to walk up for three hours and then you get your shot um and there was a newspaper article that shot the real picture where you literally have to queue for that amazing shot so this is where it 's in some ways really got out of hand and because of that um the new zealand uh parliamentary commissioner for the environment um who 's some kind of environmental audit office um simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertook an inquiry into tourism and it came out just before christmas so so essentially a year ago and they looked at well basically the environmental impacts of the current volume and the projected which of course now in the moment is not happening but essentially they concluded growth has been completely unmanaged there 's very high density in some places there 's this loss of natural quiet for which new zealand is really known like the solitude and the tranquility in the natural environment and that is lost in many places including from helicopter noise a very high carbon footprint so they did some calculations um due to air travel and cruise ships um high impact of freedom camping so that 's people like those camper when people are shout who literally drive around and stay wherever they want and cause a lot of impact in human waste um lao pai um be transient workforce a bit like australia as well decoration of landscapes landscapes and in some ways interestingly a conflict between what central government wants um and what local communities want including the maori in certain regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and central government comes in and builds a new route um why because tourism has really been seen as this growth engine for government revenue for texas so that 's a good picture so just just for for context this is christmas and then comes carved but just really briefly and and be really interesting um to see how those diagnostics would stack up in australia um they might be a bit similar so what i did um recently was to look at the arrivals which have gone upwards um but then i looked at the spending per person so this is some kind of metric that you can derive than spending per per arrival which has been stagnant i did look at sort of what would it even have to be if we were to adjust it for inflation and so you can see just for 2009 it would have to be five thousand dollars per head and so so one might argue that we 've actually gone backwards so we 're selling the natural environment and maybe community good will forever decreasing margins of return and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer jobs because i guess labor productivity is to be increased and then the value 8 per dollar spent has been stagnant for the last 15 years so you have to ask yourself why on earth was it planned to go from currently 4 million to 5 million visitors and the projections were up to 10 million so why would you do that okay um a whole new chapter and as you can imagine the previous report was quite geared towards okay what do we do now we have the opposite problem um now arrivals whatsoever um a sharp drop in international flights except really for flights that bring new zealanders back home and more recently those people who were fishermen from the ukraine and absolutely essential workers for sea lord one of the big fishing companies and of course as you might have seen in the media or not out of those fishermen of course many tested positive and that is a big problem anyway so essentially borders are closed and we now think it might be um apart from hopefully coming to the with sundays olivia um we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important though is um that because we have sort of i guess more or less eliminated the virus with the exception of the odd little flare up we are almost back towards our domestic travel is 80 of what it was and that 's by international comparison pretty good um here 's some june figures um and it has actually improved since then i don 't have pictures now but so what it what it tells us this that some parts of tourism are not suffering as badly as one might have bought and of course airlines and but other parts um that do not necessarily rely on international visitors especially since um obviously there 's a lot of domestic tourism now and people traveling quite profusely actually um to the extent that it 's impossible to get anything um any accommodation anywhere on the weekend so um olivia mentioned i do work for the department of conservation and um it 's a bit like born mouth in the uk or the bavarian lakes in germany where all of a sudden those spots will be and some a few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a little bit like that and we are placing a very strong demand and this is a map with what we call the great walks and you can see all the great works are up in the booking compared with the previous year so the domestic is not only compensating but it 's exceeding what would have been there if they had been international and the only ones that are down um the milford and the woodburn are the ones that got wiped out last year it actually was this year was just before carved in january and with some major storm events so that 's why they are down but essentially they 're up um what operators find as some have never been busier others now um who offer of course product that is very specialized towards international so um indigenous so maori cultural activities uh couch tours obviously travel agents in bangkok riders all of that and but also certain types of activities that just don 't go so well with the domestic demand others completely overbooked in in this this notion and i heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an international sort of limit of where people go outside the population center so it 's it 's quite picky um and it it follows up completely new management um challenges at least for the summer to come but it also has actually it has triggered a thinking and to what extent do we need international tourism um what are actually the benefits of domestic domestic ever only just happened there was never any marketing there was never any product development there was in fact we don 't even have data on domestic travel we stopped collecting any data in 2012 and so we now very little except now that it 's all we have so so there 's a shift in thinking now um because because there has already been quite a drive towards i guess sustainable tourism um and maybe because it started to become quite painful before carved there has now been a massive shift towards in some ways almost everyone singing from the same song sheet that we need to completely transform person and so the government um established a tourism future task force in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there 's many different futures and we want to explore the futures and and which ones are best for new zealand um it 's it 's a public private partnership and so it consists of a very small number of very high profile people and then a larger advisory group of industry leaders and a few experts i 'm on the advisory group and so we have meetings with the task force who then will put recommendations to a set of ministers and it 's really um the mandate is you 're not a recovery task force your futures task force so don 't worry about you know wage subsidies and immediate help this is not the purpose the purpose is to think ahead um and and really re design the whole way we do tourism okay so in the first report will be due in december and then the final report in april the way the way the task force is approaching that um on purpose and because they are sort of um longer term oriented is to to jump so if you look at the letter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want for tourism in new zealand to do and it really links um very closely into the well-being framework that the government has more broadly and and the four capitals are tourism contributing to yes economic but there seems to be an agreement that all we have done is focus on the economics and we 've forgotten the social the human and the environmental capital and so this future needs to be balanced across all those and if it means a lesser economic return but a environmental restoration benefit then that is the right decision so from the vision you then backcast and um i guess we 're in this process now of of coming up with solutions and finding out what are the best levers that the government could implement just to give you one flavor this is from an earlier input that tourism new zealand provided but it shows you the idea of so first of all very strong very strong input from maori ideology and worldview so the idea of humans and nature essentially being really one so do not separate them if if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us um so that 's one it 's all about um so the kite yakitanga is looking after the place the stewardship the manakitanga is is the hospitality and then you 've got place people and experiences but it is anchored it is anchored in the maori worldview okay so um in the moment it looks like it will be structured around five or six change themes and so i i did not put them here because they are evolving and i don 't know if it 's a state secret or not but um the idea is to identify so one change theme is around the environment and so there it 's really clear that tourism needs to become a carbon neutral or basically zero carbon and and you can debate what that means in terms of offsetting and nazir as opposed to zero but but there 's a clear recognition that by 2050 um essentially tourists must have decarbonized um it tourism needs to contribute to restoration of the natural environment and biodiversity so that 's one change theme another one is around the structure of the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central government and the local government and there 's a general feeling that power is need to be redistributed down towards the local level to enable the communities to actually manage their tourism and rather than in our last meeting we discussed this notion that communities often feel that person is done to them so they 're kind of disempowered victims of external forces and this maybe sometimes that 's perceptions and sometimes it 's true and it 's the the the structures and and also the way the money flows um and so it goes on so this this community theme and and it may be that there will be one around research and data and innovation okay so um some of you may have seen us by anna pollock and or other sort of diandra who talk about regenerative tourism and so that 's really um at the core of this whole um reimagining i guess effort um or journey is from tourism being exploitative and so in the bottom you see a degenerating system so tourism taking to extract essentially economic benefit and maybe visitor experiences for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call then sustainable to just sustain a steady sort of status quo to then moving towards a rich innovative approach that actively ensures that person i guess the shorthand is leaf leaves behind more than it takes now what does it mean in practice that that obviously is to be learned and discovered but um at least as a as a goal and so for example tourists um and olivia we talked about coral restoration projects where the tourism industry could have a net positive effect whether it 's for the visitors the community or the operators or partnerships so so so moving towards um well restoring and regenerating and that 's that 's about the environment but also the culture so this idea of of flourishing and healing past damage and is is also really important in those discussions um the notion of planetary boundaries really important um and i mentioned climate change so so there will be a crunch point in all those discussions ultimately the volume question and how much tourism or how much tourism impact can we actually tolerate in in a particular place so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point there will be some hard decisions i guess um and and then the whole the whole concept of the donald economics where you want to so in the middle you have this this space of of tourism delivering enough dividend uh for example for social well-being but also then at the outer end being constrained by the ecological imperatives and so there 's a nice uh maori donut um there 's actually different versions of it but again it just shows you that importance of linking it to to the frameworks and understandings of of of maridem now just today i got this actually someone sent me said oh you need to check the labor election manifesto because obviously we now have labor and government with absolute majority and we i guess people do expect that a lot will happen in the next three years and so there 's three particular points where um tourism is mentioned and you will see right up there just highlighted and read um because it 's a bit hex heavy so restart we imagine you get that then the sustainable low carbon high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a wish list but um i guess that is kind of the vision and it does recognize the importance of domestic tourism and then again it 's quite interesting the the last point where it says our natural environment is critical to our well-being so again the central um importance of well-being tourism and national identity and and the um just in response to carved at the government has already invested in nature and so i just show you this one because it 's um it 's one of the biggest stimulus packages of the government and 1.2 billion into jobs for nature um there 's different types there 's wetland restoration there 's um reforestation there 's working with farmers to increase biodiversity on farms so there 's a whole bunch um some are specifically in areas um where there 's a tourism unemployment so for example there 's a project with aj heggett bungie in queenstown to restore the native vegetation in one of the areas where they operate um so that 's that 's good and hopefully building a closer link between tourism and conservation i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ideas and then i will conclude and look forward to how we can so what 's happening in the sundays and how we can maybe um think what it means um there 's a real as i indicated earlier there 's a real appetite for becoming a little bit more place-based so local not national um and there 's a drive from the communities and the regional tourism organizations to really um invest and they actually have received can you still hear me olivia oh good um the the government actually has also provided specific stimulus money for rtrs and and one condition was to actually invest it into destination management including in particular sustainability so what i 'm showing here is um the the tourism plan of the bay of plenty and again you can see the terms environmental regeneration community inclusivity transformational visitor experiences um in the dna that is unique to the whakapapa so so it 's all about regeneration it 's all about place building by the locals so that they are in a good position to welcome the visitors that they want to welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um the tourism industry association has sort of before covered already started with their new zealand tourism sustainability commitment and that has particular areas economic visitor community environment and what 's important is that obviously before it was voluntary and now there 's a bit a move towards can we make it mandatory and how can you strengthen it towards measurement and really stepping it up industry-wide as a program and in the last example just to highlight this sort of interest from local level to ensure that tourism is not just something that passes through but something that has a purpose and actually leaves the community in a better state than it was before so kiwi welcome is based in the queenstown area and you can um become part of that to essentially buy it 's a bit like flybys you you you subscribe to it and you get discounts but the money goes towards local initiatives whether they are south low environmental so you can see you love your community so it 's it 's really connecting around a common purpose it 's just been launched so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my last slide and what would regenerative tourism look like in the mid sunday islands and i think um really important that obviously there 's already a lot happening so it 's not necessary reinventing the wheel but it 's connecting it thinking systemic and maybe scaling up so for example what are the linkages between tourism and other industries and can that strengthen the economic benefit but maybe also sustainability partnerships what restoration activities are happening and i know there 's there 's quite a bit of stuff happening what kind of visitors would be the right visitors what kind of measurement has already been done or should be done and how much is the community involved in driving division and and determining what 's happening and and how can risks be managed that 's climate risk but also maybe our dependencies on particular markets so i think this is the time to really think about those types of issues so to conclude and maybe start the discussion um and i 'm sure you 've thought a lot about it already anyway but but one thing is to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no need i mean transformation doesn 't mean to throw everything out but okay with actually a few things that are really really good but which ones are the things that we want to leave behind and and that always has to happen when you you sort of merge into a new system so what 's what do we need to preserve and or little title and which ones to abandon um what mechanisms need to be put in place um to to to move into the right trajectory so for example funding models is there enough funding to do the things that need to be done um so we 're talking we already have our additionally but this discussion of allowable bad tax to really provide funds for local government uh what other regulations like mandatory carbon reporting for example um education campaigns etc so what are the levers and who is putting them in place so i think with that olivia i leave it let me see if i lost you all together um hopefully not um here we are all right so so um really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's already happening do you have any questions from anyone online you can put it in the chat or you can um unmute yourself and start talking it 's fine okay well i might have a ques oh sharon did you want to i just want to know how we get these people over here and because this is everything that 's just been said and all the slides i 've just looked for i can 't tell you how many meetings we 've sat in asking for all of these things like at the moment we 're asking the great barrier reef marine park authority for a lot of the things that have just been outlined and i just think we need to get this new zealand model in front of every single we need to get it in front of us and federal governments and um i mean obviously is in front of our council olivia but this is i mean ryan the mayor need to be seeing this presentation and um this is this is what our tourism industry is asking for what we 've been looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to covid and we we need even more now yeah it is it is true that in the moment luckily and fingers crossed the the environment is really good in new zealand as in i mean the political environment i mean and the the frame and where the the political will i guess and and look i 'm sure there will be lots of obstacles as well and and always the risk to slip back into business as usual but i think if we can 't if we can 't make significant changes now then we probably never can so that 's true on the other hand um that example of of the bay of islands which really also started before carved um there 's a lot that can be done by a destination on their own i mean now of course they get real talent i mean and there 's so advanced they can actually grab some of these you know ideas and the fertile soil and and so that 's really great but but they have started the journey before um so so that 's one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between um some destinations to strengthen the voice um so so i think there 's hopefully hopefully still opportunity um to get a few things off the ground even if maybe the overall environment is it doesn 't quite have to leave us in the right place does anyone else have a question otherwise um i 've got a question um dominic did you have a question melinda sorry so um i forgot a question for you suzanne obviously you 're doing the higher level planning at the moment um but i 'm just wondering whether you 've considered what kind of programs or systems or incentives may be applied to get all of the operators on board with these programs like is there is new zealand developing their own program or tapping into an existing program to help with that um yes so there is the existing um that sustainability commitment by the industry association so there 's security equivalent and and sort of it 's it 's got areas like carbon and and what do you do for biodiversity and what do you do for minimum bites so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it of being a bit soft still so it 's not like earthcheck that really measures and in some ways has those i guess benchmarks and you 've got to perform so it 's more a commitment it it has 1500 members or so now and the argument always goes okay we get them all involved and raise awareness and they do stuff but now the discussion is make it mandatory face in measurement so so you using an existing vehicle but i i think that might have even used the term of tightening the screws so um anyway in a good way um that 's one way another one would be so in the department of conservation where i work with exploring whether the concession that an operator gets to work in national parks should have conditions attached to the environmental performance including in particular carbon reporting and a plan for carbon results so this is some of those regulatory levers and also how the government gives out money in the future so that is another consideration to support destinations only if they show certain things and is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to align with the paris agreement or have they set more optimistic targets so this is a really good question olivia because there 's actually a bit of a discussion in the moment and one that 's equally relevant to australia because technically as you know we 're not really a sector and i mean in the in the political frameworks out there there 's national goals for for for carbon and then it 's broken down into a few sectors where there will be sector gas transport energy agriculture can 't remember six not tourism because tourism is a bit of everything and so there 's a bit of a discussion in the moment and and and a bit of initiative should tourism have their own goal or are they just part of you know the transport girl obviously will really impact on on air new zealand for example and the rental car fleets so that will already be filtering down um but then for example things that are really specific to tourism um so that 's in discussion in the idea there 's no answer yet okay that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few other familiar faces here um yeah does anybody else have any questions for suzanne just um just around um budget what um so obviously you said that these these recommendations that the task force is coming up with recommendations which are going back to ministers and was uh what sort of funding models would be needed has the new zealand government come up with a budget that they 're prepared to put behind this to make it happen um very good question and i 'm absolutely sure that the recommendations of the task force will definitely have a dollar figure attached uh no doubt about that um but there 's different well in fact um to elaborate a bit there 's actually even calls within this process now to even establish how much the government is already investing in person because it 's actually a lot by the time um we 've got a regional development fund and if you were to take our tourism projects and there 's major i mean we 're talking many 100 200 million there 's milford sound redevelopment uh this there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know be revisited because the demand was 150 million for international marketing and so there 's a lot of money being spent is it spent in the right place so that 's one thing and the other one is the international visitor levy which is 35 per person just that nobody is coming now so the idea was to get about 80 million a year for tourism and conservation in particular but now it 's dried out and and again you in some ways you don 't want to make yourself dependent on a mechanism when you actually say well maybe we don 't need quite that much international travel so you can 't hang all your projects on it um and then there 's the discussion of a bid tax um which would then go straight back to the local government to manage some of those infrastructure issues and so whether then there 's other i mean we sort of the academics and are obviously trying to ask for some investment into research into specific tourism science development and to inform all this change process and so so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a vehicle then it 's easier to attach funds to it and so anyway that that 's the help and and just another question about how you 're going to so it wasn 't just the funding obviously you were talking about the need to change some things from being voluntary to mandatory and we 've got similar sorts of issues here that will need to happen for um for the industry um but what we come up against there is uh well for a start we 've got political will um that needs to be applied but also um we then find we get into the realms of uh bureaucratic hurdles and legislation how is your government getting around or what are you going to do um i think a little bit what you said earlier that in fact many destinations and tourism businesses do want the change so there 's a collective interest in not continuing with business as usual because there was a recognition that 's why i started with the hull you know this is how it actually started to look quite bad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a there 's an understanding that we don 't want to continue as before so we got to do something and as long as everyone does it um you know even in new zealand says if there will be a carbon tax on international flights as long as it 's on every carrier we actually happy with that so so this i think there 's a reasonable willingness the other one is that some things might be kind of mandatory by industry for industry and that 's um that 's maybe a little bit more accepted and then obviously you need the support systems and the investment so then you 're back at funding but it 's a bit like um the the decarbonizing the great barrier reef island project where i think quite a bit of queensland government funding went into working with the resorts to help reduce i guess carbon impacts so then it 's a partnership approach with some incentive i do not be interested in um and also olivia because i know you 've got a lot going that 's there 's already especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of um almost sort of seats or catalysts projects and

Lake master plan and we show residents the completed look out in Collinsville and more earlier this month mayor Andrew Wilcox revealed the 10 meter long aquarium at the Whitsunday Coast Airport the aquarium is part of our 15 million-dollar terminal expansion when people think of the whitsundays I think about 74 beautiful islands and of course we are the heart of the Great Barrier Reef and this epitomizes this right behind me here so when your visitors come and visit this great region of us the first thing they see is the heart of the Great Barrier Reef but the whole experience for the arriving passengers the first thing they didn 't seen the Whitsunday so might have a really great experience and when they leave do so you know they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars worth an

through the to the wet period and make sure that we get the internal fit-out completed as quickly as possible we 're only towards the middle of next year but it 'll be around August that we start thinking about when we 're going to move insurance is a big step in the process as most people could imagine and I 'm sure most people in our community have had similar experiences we had to meet a

going into a further section of detailed design and it 'll go for tender and will be then we 'll start to see the building coming out the ground gonna be a single story building it 's meeting the budget of nine point six million dollars that the council has said it 's going to be a fairly light and airy building that 's what we 're trying to do but adult it 's also going to accommodate the local disaster center and the climate change innovation hub and it 'll be constructed from sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait it 's been so long I realize it 's been difficult for the community it 's been very difficult for council with all the dispersal of our staff as well so trying to make it happen as soon as possible the issue is when it 's just not council money when you rely on insurance state money and federal money we have to go through all the process and we have to meet the criteria [Music] as your way of flagstaff hill was significantly damaged during the cyclone it 's an iconic piece of infrastructure for the whole bowl and indeed the whitsundays what we 've been successful in doing is getting a million dollars worth of funding from Kate Jones and Tourism Minister and it 's actually not quite enough because what we want to do up there is the partner with gira dollar and provide an indigenous experience so what we want to do is there 's an opportunity for bush tucker trail we want to do some interpretive dancing and of course when we do the whole building up we want to be able to tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our safer communities program and basically the intent was to add CCTV coverage around the Main Street area so utilizing councils existing buildings and infrastructure we 've added cameras to the roof to basically provide CCTV coverage of the roundabouts around the shopping center and also across the road to the pool covering also the crossing and we 've also report CCTV cameras into the pool area to obviously cover all the use of the pool in the facilities and councils assets and we have a memorandum and are standing with with police if there is a an an incident we remember the public is requesting footage we would actually direct them first to the police because we base it better be based on a criminal event the police would then investigate the police have acces to the CCTV footage and they can review if there is a case to actually move forward and they want to make a prosecution they will formally come to Council for release of the footage so counts what this stage does not release footage directly to members of the public it 's the

the sheriff circuit I 'm Jared R which was the fastest growing local governor Western astray and one of the fastest developing in Australia as well prior to that was actually in the Shire of Broome so

and every time I 'm out with the council 's of one of the their divisions they 're shown me something the Newman and opportunity and I think the biggest issue the biggest challenge working with the council is let 's get a couple hundred million dollars where the projects will go on the go let 's get those knocked away and then let 's start looking at what are the future opportunities as well for other development how can we provide opportunities for jobs for our community economic benefits for our community in a really sustainable way most of the councillors through their divisions and actually having a look at the challenges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about being a chief executive officers you 've got to be involved with the community as well so I 've joined her say the Rotary Club in

like we 've never done that before and it was starting to think that we 're in for something more serious we got the phone call to say that we needed to go to the shelter so we spent all day Saturday at the shelter preparing on the Sunday before the cyclone and it was decided that we 're going to evacuate a few of the area so a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other emergency services to get the evacuations underway we didn 't know it was going to come through early beach all through Bowen or divert south and go you know to Makai or so we had to try and evacuate people across a large area the day prior to cyclone Debbie honey I was taking calls more so about what flood zones were in do we have to evacuate where can we evacuate to I don 't think we could have been more prepared we did everything we possibly could we had so many come into I and II because I was scared of what was going to happen and they came in and then there was no getting home as time went on it was getting more intense so then you were getting more of we have evacuated however now our place is not safe that we 're in where can we go from here so we 've turned a region we 've got 24,000 square kilometres and it the cyclone impacted every square centimeter of that 24,000 square along with it I was at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge bang and at the same time I heard Tegan screaming I went to the bathroom and found him on the floor unconscious well at that stage I didn 't know if he was alive I had been just checking windows etcetera around the house making everything secure and then I moved into the bathroom just to check that and that was it the impact was there and then at 11 o 'clock and was unconscious quite quickly when I 'm actually on the phone of the boss being notified about that job I 'm watching the house directly opposite us been totally annihilated the roof was coming off the walls were falling apart or I didn 't actually know at that particular stage that there was a person in that that home I wish I had known at the time or what a one across got a man told them to come to the station our roof came off at about two o 'clock all I can remember is the sound of the tin coming away and in the installation just flying around the house it was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window because I spent about 12 hours holding on in the front door so they didn 't didn 't blow any it is actually the first cyclone where I 've actually was a little bit scared it was you know ever I can it was I was anxious I was very overwhelmed I 've talked to very old locals and never experienced it before it must have been nearly two and a half hours in and my son rang me from Gladstone and he said mum you 're just gonna have to hang in there be strong he said because this thing 's gonna go for hours and I said mate he 's not gonna live for hours but we have a policy in the Queen 's a name of the service that we 're not supposed to take our vehicles out in wind greater than 80 kilometers an hour and obviously the wind gusts were a lot greater than that I said to Tegan if they can 't come to us we 've got to get down to them I 'm going to go and get the truck because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV and everything was still working I noticed that there was sort of like an eye of a storm that was coming through early Beach I 've jumped in my ambulance mid-market seen as I race to the front door the blue and red lights come flashing around the corner which was never been so relief to see you know he was very seriously injured he had a deep laceration to his upper arm that actually included his thoracic cavity it could have picked the worst our worst track for us at castle because it basically affected the four major towns in the region the major challenge was communication we had no communication we didn 't know what was going on anywhere else early hours of Wednesday morning we all just wanted to go home and you then you started to think what 's out there immediate thing after the cyclone was just making sure all our people are all their people are safe we 're dealing with a bit of a disaster within their coordination center ceilings were falling down from above us we had floods where basically we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us it made it we were very hard to coordinate anything in that center it was very hard working conditions as well we had no power because of the water in Dacian affected air power and yet to move patients to corridors and all that I was coming in through the air conditioning it was 30 in the morning that we opened and it was me and two other gentlemen and we went out the back because the first door you open it 's a generator door and we sort of went out to make sure the coast is clear because we have no communication with the old ECC and we just stood there and could not believe that there was still life outside of the cyclone like everything was basically unserviceable everything from the sewage system the water system and the road network you know the whole lot the response and the phone calls were already coming in by that stage so all that sort of had to get set aside and had to get on to the task of actually crew name event we actually lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the next morning after we arrived to you as we were trying to clean out the shop people pulling up out front wanting supplies etc so with guys up on the roof pretty tired so we open the doors and started serving basically straight away the cleanup effort started the day after the cyclone the wind stopped there was a big struggle to get sewer connections back on as quick as what we could a lot of those guys even are they afraid and prosopon they love to live down and nearly Beach so they couldn 't get in in from edible you know what number of days so they basically set up their own Operations Center one of the managers garage our main office was actually the the idea of my nine-year-old son Bradley when we couldn 't get anywhere he said dad what I just set up base in the shed and he went her out setting up desk computers even had a name tag set up for all my for my managers and he kept nights we were successful and making sure all roads were opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still under in the flood inundation but that was that was our highest priority at the time just to make sure supply trucks and emergency services could come to the region three days after cycling once the road was open to where we actually sent the truck up to here I 've got more supplies to bring Becky as we were one of the few places were able to operate some people who had to get to like my helicopter others by boat just make sure that everyone was right and then we had the long struggle of Pat 's in the region back up the progress in bringing the infrastructure back up to speed in 11 months has been pretty amazing people walk around good gosh you know the environment looks so good it 's come back you know and hey you know how are you people and look I see every day those people that just help there was a huge amount of work involved in the cleanup there was well in excess of 250 thousand cubic meters of green waste and we were in the end running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately put about 70 generators out on site so we had some big hours there at times the boys are working like twenty two hour days you just did what you had to do to get back to normal ships that we built between ourselves of rule fires and the army is something more take one 's forever and though they had so much big gear the army were incredible and we 've got them earmarked every time I mean once you go through something like that I think that one thing it teaches us is there 's not much we can 't face if we band together probably the main thing they 'll gonna take away is a new new found respect for the military the police the ambulance the fire service and the SES those people really really stood up and helped their community the police and the other motor service are all responding to these jobs but they 've still got their own properties which have got damaged homes and things like that still coming up turning up doing a 12 l a day or longer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well so do you think I 'm one of the luckiest people not I live to work in the place that I do with such an amazing team we have lots of disasters and they seem to always rise to the challenge it was so nice to actually meet a lot of other people within the community that actually pulled together to make a part of this team the community values in this area are a lot greater than people give them credit for everybody help everybody there was no you do by yourself they all got in and helped each other I 'm very proud for the region and lots people suffered and I don 't think anyone is really quite prepared for what was to come afterwards so I think they 've done really well burn as a community as soon as you say someone hey this happened to me like alright what can I do to help do you need anything like it 's such a giving town the people just walking in the shed never said a word drop cartons of beer off Vicky 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger generation cops a lot of flack now and I think that was a great example of of young young people doing something yeah purposely doing something good I think the community is just so much stronger now than it ever was before and I think with the next event if there is everyone that would just become stronger again it 's your home and what happy to stay here for quite a while we 're going to have more events further down the track certainly not any hurry for it but we will have events further down the track so it 's a matter of building in resilience enduro infrastructure so it can 't handle

harvesters capable of cutting the green unburned canes once the cane has been transported to the mills it is shredded and fed into a series of mills each consisting of large rollers which squeeze the juice from the cane lime is mixed with the extracted juice to neutralize any impurities the juice then begins an evaporation process which sees it turn to syrupy like molasses then into sugar crystals

bill lois and we 're in a place of in my view tranquility the water behind me is water that 's traveled on a long long journey from the catchment of the mighty birdicon river which takes up approximately a third of queensland on the western side of the great dividing range and that waters travel from those catchment areas through a number of processes also within the river system the mighty birdicon river through the burning and falls dam clear weir and down into the lower delta we 're in the bottom end of the south birding water board area management really consists of water table management the processes that are used and this water here is water that has been consistently used for irrigation or for other activities in the case of the south birding and water board it pumps the water from the river it puts it through diversion channels it uses that water in recharge pits which go into the underground aquifer for the farmers to actually re-lift and use for their irrigation and that irrigation process is continual throughout the aquifer system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excess goes back down it 's reused by another farmer and continues on its way throughout this defined water area the water area is against the sea and just behind me about 100 meters is the start of saltwater creek which is the end of the journey for this water where it actually enters another environment and has other uses apart from the hydrological cycle where water evaporates or transpires turns into rain back into the catchment and back to where we are through its long long journey we 're very satisfied with this water here this is a pristine area very much untouched by man we 've got most of our natural trees here this waterway has been slightly improved with crossings access points but the actual journey of water from here trickles down into our sea water channels our creeks the quality of the water of course is represented by the trees that are here the little fish the smaller juvenile fish that are in these creeks behind me which make this place at their home before they actually grow much larger and then return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive rain in the catchment especially our floodplain catchment of the south burning water area this is one of the main floodways that takes that excess water out to sea the lagoon behind me is reminiscent of many of the natural lagoons with water lilies and very very clean water because that water 's been through a filtering process on its way we 're here in the middle of the year it 's almost what we call our winter so there 's a limited amount of water and by the end of this year that water will diminish because of the dry times we 're experiencing but again once we have rain it 'll rejuvenate the whole area and flood levels can be seen along tree lines where they carry debris and of course that 's what keeps the area alive the trees are the natural pumps in this area especially the tea trees and a lot of the other natives because they 're not disturbed they they carry on with their own natural process the water itself has probably been through many of filtering of of the aquifer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lifeblood of our district and it is our liquid gold here because of the the need of water and the need of water for irrigated agriculture and the sustainability of our community very good example of a self-help community-based scheme our future we believe that commercialisation of water is going to impact fairly strongly on the activities of the south burning water board the community knows only too well the value of water of that liquid gold and although they don 't place a monetary value on it they place a value on it for the community and for the activities that generate good healthy and sustainable communities the well-being of a community is expressed by its water especially in agricultural areas and the way that water is developed and utilized is the end result of a good community one of those concerns is a commercialisation that will take water to other places and reduce the natural processes that these areas rely mostly on the south vertical water board has mimicked natural processes in artificial recharge and water table management and they 've been over the last 40 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at different ways of utilizing the water that 's available even though our river water may have changed in its quality in the sense that there 's more suspended solids or turbidity levels are higher we need to utilize that water in different ways that we can still mimic the natural processes and keep the balance the future is really in our hands and the innovation that we can put to good use to carry on the good job i think that that can be achievable i 've had some some time with the waterboard and experienced the successes of the waterboard expansion of the industry that has been here and we are still a premier irrigation area there 's no doubt that we 've got the climate the sunshine the water and the good soils and we are very conscious of what we 've got and how we should maintain that the methods that we would use or utilize is definitely not beyond our vision and many of these water areas which are similar to the ones behind me in the top end of our system where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even with sediment load type water where we can actually filter that water through a natural sand filter and get it back into the underground so i believe there 's still a great future here for us we need to keep a common sense about it and a practicality about it and minimise that cost that would that always seems to be one of the bug bears of irrigation schemes around the australia if not the world our populations are growing and we believe we 're in one of the better parts of of the world and there 's no doubt that people will be attracted to this area not only for irrigated agriculture but for what the area and the benefits of the area have to offer and even if our population does grow to a point where we branch out into other types of activities other than irrigated agriculture we believe we 'll be prepared for that in the future i 'm bruno cameron i 've been farming in this district for 60 years i 've been involved with sugar cane only and back in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were producing somewhere between three and four hundred thousand ton of cane then as as time went on it became pretty obvious in about the mid 60s that we weren 't going to have sufficient water to keep expanding we were hoping then to expand to 500 000 we were told that we didn 't have the water so a group of uh grower representatives came up with the idea of taking free flow water from the birdicon river and using it to recharge underground this idea was put to the growers and it was received quite well so the leaders then approached the then sugar miller well the millers agreed that they would fund it the ratio of two-thirds one-third which was what we based the division of sugar monies on proceeded to form channels we used natural waterways and we formed intrusion areas in appropriate places which were merely hulls in the ground down to the sands of the aquifer and we would pump clean water into there and it found its way into the aquifer in 66 we plant our first water and then about 68 69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance instead of expanding our production we were pretty sure it would have retracted in the early 80s we exceeded one million tonnes of uh cane production then came the advent of the verdict and dam fortunately enough since 1988 it first filled it hasn 't failed one year to fill this spill point now this allowed us to pump for longer periods which was great but at the same time it probably diminished the amount of clean water that we had from the river now since we couldn 't pump dirty water and when we say dirty water we mean silt laden water into our aquifers and intrusion pits for fear of clogging up the sand we then shifted our policy slightly and allowed more surface pumping from channels we put a surcharge on that but it was readily accepted by growers the fact that the millers and the growers got together and done this with their own funding probably the first time that millers and growers have ended jointly into such a venture and that venture of course proved very successful i must end up by saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost quadrupled our production when at the original time of establishing the board we were doubtful of reaching half a million tons the fact that the board is still operating on the same basis still self-funded self-managed or emphasizes pretty strongly about the the establishment operation and management of the south vertical water board has been one of the truly successful stories of this district well my name is pat tui i became a member of the staff of this this water board very late in 1977 the fact that pumping as far as the board was concerned particularly with regard to recharge it was conditioned by the fact it was free flow we had access to free flow at all times was not water or turbidity level that that sanctioned pit recharge the system that the board developed prior to my becoming involved and from that stemmed high turbidity pumping now what did we do with the high turbidity water if we put it into the pits of course we clogged our pits clogging the pits and at the time that i came here we had 35 of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because not only was it costly in terms of cleaning it was very costly in terms of importing sand from the burning river to re-line those pits because we were getting to an unworkable depth even though we had some excellent machines for cleaning particularly of course the track equipped excavator so the the board in this wisdom then after discussing the situation fairly closely got away from the fact that the border recently was set up for groundwater recharge that is to replenish the groundwater contained in the aquifers that was pumped out by the farmers for irrigation the decision being that the high turbidity period of flow in the river we would continue pumping but we would not release that water into pets but would make it available to the farmers for a free pumping source and this of course had a dual advantage they they were able to utilize the water that that we were pumping and as a number of farmers said that high turbidity water saves us quite a considerable amount of money in terms of fertilizer because the stupidity settles out and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect becomes a top dressing the spinoff from that lay in the fact that by the farmers being allowed to open water access and pumping from the channel system they then left the groundwater alone and so they were not creating any particular drawdown now this was a major advantage to us particularly in the in the seaboard profiles where a buffer of the freshwater had to be maintained against the seaboard to offset saltwater profile intrusions and this was successful to the extent there was a herringbone effect out in the ira area of intruded salt that was shrunk back in its plan area and also bulldozed towards the seaboard profiles so all of this stem from the fact today the farm wasn 't pumping from the underground and had access to the turbid water that was being pumped into the channels this tend to fluff up and loosen the soil and therefore they were able to obtain penetration of the irrigation waters and the aim was either uranadam or hellsgate both of which of course were headwater dams there was some degree of timidity i approached one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that if they were going to go ahead with some form of pottage in the birding river system they would need to look at two things one a far larger dam than the one that they had in the ones that they had in mind in the headwaters and b they would have to involve a lot more people and by a lot more people i was indicating that they would need to consult with the local authorities from bowen to townsville and inland to charters towers and del ribel but also they would have to make contact with the various industrial consortiums within the area that i profiled to them so that they could obtain support and i was one that was fortunate enough to be there during the during the completion of the dam and its official happening and i think it 's history now that bob hawk realized what was going to be the the end result and benefit of the construction of the dam at the site and the federal government put up 141 million dollars with the infrastructure responsibility being placed in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and largely uh direction by what is now in my time was irrigation water then it become queensland water resources then it become dpi and now it 's i think it 's sun water it was breaking new ground completely the concept of recharge of course now bear in mind the fact that 37 pets were functioning and they and they were brought into line by my predecessor who was a tom musgrave tom implemented the the activity of the selection of sites for pits these of course were by and large subject to the whim and and and regard of the local farmer who was very very reluctant to make any land available for anything other than production of cane but once it was realized that these pits were an achievable situation and i would highlight here the iron pits two kilometers away it was a farmer by the name of delaney now when we opened the the iron pits for recharge this chappy delaney could phone the office and say pat you must have cracked the eye of pits on the day before yesterday my well has risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transfer of water underground the hydraulic profiles of the underground is such that it will achieve the flow of water from these recharge pits it 's certainly been accredited the board over the years that it has been in function releases from the dam flowed downstream and the intermediate bondage at clear weir had a tendency to tidy up the water to a point whereby recharge did become acceptable in terms of optimity the greatest advantage of the dam of course was regulated flow that warren 's gully was double stage bethune 's driven by 250 horsepower motors and the inlet system was a 48 inch underground pipe with a grill system screening out river debris and that sort of thing and the whole station of course was submersible uh with a pressurized belt over each of the two pumping units at the top that in effect became a siltation chamber because we had quite a length of 48 inch pipeline i think what was in that about four or five kilometers that we had to arrest the infiltration of sand into that particular area because to clean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us and involved tremendous man hours so it was a lot easier to develop a facilitation trap with a with an open top that we could just back an excavator up to it and clean the rubbish out of it re-lift stations that is relive station to lift the water out of the birdie can river into a channel system and the development of of pits and the recharge pit is very very simple because the alluvials are not terribly deep here in the birding and access to to clean aquifers is quite simple in that most places clean aquifers can be achieved by one and a half to no more than two meters in depth and there you have exposed the old delta egg formation of the verdict and river and the porosity of that varies from very very coarse to very very fine but by pumping water into those pits that were so developed they could be whatever length of the farmer in those days were prepared to make available it 's a little beach yeah about a 12 foot scale living there for a while now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams down here you get weed and stuff on them and uh you came down one morning and the crocodile was laying there so you got a bit of a fright there to calm him down when he got back in the morning so they 're always here you never see them until it 's a cool morning or something they get out on the bank and get into the sun you can see the slight formation of that that uh sand going around there and down further there 's a rocky overflow point so we 've got a natural damning effect here now so all it does is elevates the water in this pond for our pump to have a good flow through and not not staff for water we pump it out and put it into our channel system yeah and that channel system goes around the edge of the southern boundary of our area this water goes up over the bank into warren 's gulley channel and travels right through our whole system here on the southern boundary and it services a lot of recharge pits base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand it will need to be cleaned as vegetation that 's sparsely spread over the bottom needs to be removed and once water enters here it percolates down through the sand and directly into the underground this pit 's located very close to town it 's one of the 40 or so pits and recharge intrusion areas that we 've got our town water supply is taken from ground water and this pit along with others has the effect of replenishing that water for town water use this outlet is uh one of a variation of outlets that we use but the idea of an outlet structure as we 've got here which breaks down over the rock beneath it is to try and aerate the water get a bit of oxygen into the water and allow it to settle once it gets into the pit as the water comes in it bubbles up or mushrooms out over the top of the cylinder it falls down over the cylinder over the concrete and onto the rocks which eliminates erosion in such a an erosion prone soil condition and maintains our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or our delta slopes away from where this channel goes so this is a channel that provides very good intrusion value for our activities for the delta keeps the aquifer topped up also provides a barrier between rainfall that mobilizes soil salts and and the fresh water in the aquifer so we tend to keep that line fairly full so that it keeps that mobilized rainfall runoff out of the area from the surrounding grazing properties and natural salts that come out of the soils it 's a total management system it 's not just surface irrigation it 's about you know maintaining the water table maintaining the aquifer and also supplying that surface water to conjunctively use with other water so the cane farmer gets a really good mix in the water that suits his process his application any other crops likewise you know they 've got good quality water the river water with its turbidity also helps some farmers where they 're in very sandy soils to actually seal the soils up a bit with flood irrigation so that the flood irrigation doesn 't seep or percolate through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run through their furrows and irrigate their crops so the silt in the water does help them doesn 't help us with their recharge activities but there 's a good compromise there we maintain a fairly good intake percentage over a year that actually goes through our channel beds and banks and uh helps the aquifer we 've got off takes you know farmers taking water but some of that channel goes through very sandy soil so the actual intrusion values of those channels are kept alive by by the the excavator with the rake on it the rake actually takes out any vegetation but it also disturbs the sediment that 's deposited in the bottom of the channel and those channels are built through sandy strata so they actually take a lot of water which goes down into the aquifer hi my name 's laurie regano i started in the sugar industry in late 1969 i started on dad 's farm which is a riverbank farm on powers road i joined the board in 1990. i enjoyed my time on the board i learned a lot of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what the board does and actually when you think back of the people who really instigated this whole project back in 1966 they had the foresight to see that we needed to help ourselves if we were to have a sustainable sugar industry in this district with the good work of the board also the good work of the staff and in the time that i was there i must comment on the board that i was with and also the staff that i work with i work with bill lowes who i think was a fantastic manager of the board at the end of the day was up to the staff to implement that policy and i believed in the time that i was there they 've done an excellent job i always seen the staff as good friends not only as workers of the board but we all as a whole team played a major role in what the board did well i was chairman for a six year period and we went through water reforms and water reform was a big thing in them days we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes the board went through was the loss of the production levy in them days we were able to put a levy on on production and everyone paid on the amount of cane that went through the mill and they paid so many cents per tonne to the board it was then deemed to be an excise and it had to be abolished the two boards of north and south virgin water board at the time we we really weren 't happy in losing that levy and we had to try to get something else in place so with the managers and and the two chairmans and that with the help of the board we we went to brisbane to try to do something that would have tried to hold the production levy i think we put out an excellent case but at the end of the day it was it was hard it was going to be hard to maintain we were lucky in them days that probably through the work that we did through through the board and that that we were lucky to hold through the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place and actually everyone 's accepted and it seems to work well the board had an allocation that was basically negotiated with the department and from there the boards sort of continued on its work but we sort of bill and i sat down with the board there one day and we sort of said gee have we got enough allocation so we did decide an additional 5000 mega liters of water at one stage so with that we we bought the 5 000 and then we increased that by another 10 000 so we bought a total of 15 000 mega liters additional to the actual allocation that the board has today what that does is to me is an insurance to the board to to what we do to the replenishment of the board and also it does i suppose in years when you know that the water is not going to be in the dam there 's always going to be that little bit extra does come in handy the board has in its time i believe helped the whole community it 's not only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it 's a cane farmer or whether it 's a veggie grower or whether it 's the townspeople the millers and the growers csrn and cane growers have really got together to keep this this board alive because at the end of the day it 's the water that we can put in the underground through replenishment and through our surface water uh application that produces the crops that are needed in this district and of course if it wasn 't for this board the crops that are there now and and the community benefits that are here now would not be here it 's a self-help scheme it 's unique but i believe we 've got the biggest natural aquifer in australia where we 'll leave the board in the future will be interesting but i think the board has got it 's got the runs on the board to to show that that it can do things properly and if it needs to change it will change but i also believe that with anything that you do today i think you prove change you 'll never force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've diversified and what we 're doing here on my farm we 're growing different horticultural crops cucumbers i 've got some chilies over there pumpkins all grown on plastic and trickle irrigation it um it seems to be the the way to go we 've got plenty of water here in the verdict but it 's good for the growing with trickle is is very efficient so with uh our vine crops we get good results we can fertilize the via the trickle quite manageable because you you 've taken away all the physical labor of weeding just to make sure that we keep our irrigation tape clean of any grime and stuff so the waters forever won 't get blocked up the outlets the emitters won 't be blocked so we 've got a filter system just tap straight into the delivery pipe through the filter into the blue blue hose sunny hose and out to the blocks of vegetables i 've got growing this is the main one of the main lines i 've got coming out of my irrigation pump and then once it gets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've just got certain take off points you just make a hole put your fitting in hook your tape up the tape travels underneath the plastic all the way down to the end tie it off and that 's it the reason for the for the plant to the one side is when you 've got machines that go through and punch your holes and and get you get your plastic in preparation for planting you wouldn 't like to puncture your tape the implement lays your plastic blows your tape covers it covers the dirt up on the sides and leaves you the feel prepared as you see it it 's just a soft plastic tape underneath the grounds with the the emitters dripping out the water through every every certain amount of distance so that 's that 's what it 's all about that 's all it takes to water our crops underneath the ground all these young fruits as they 're growing and the plant develops by being able to fertilize it you 're fertilizing each fruit each flower that comes on and fruits you it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier plant would have had with the pre-fertilizers everything under the ground so you 're just continually fertilizing and these these younger fruits will develop to something like this we hope also some hot chilies you can see the small small chilies grown in here maybe just starting to come online just one of the many crops in the area that you can grow because of the conditions we have here plenty of sunshine nice warm winters and plenty of water with the different crops because of the moldy culturism that we have here in australia now we 've got plenty of asians europeans have come to our shores taught us how do we eat all these crops so we 've got the water we 've got the land the sunshine to grow these crops for them my name is chris cannon we have been farming in this location my family since 1914 and we 're sugarcane farmers for all that time actually my great-grandfather started farming in this area and my father was a founding member of the local waterboard area he was a member of the south vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having mixed success with their other crops mainly be due to learning as we go along there 's nothing wrong with the birding climate and the abundance of water here these crops love growing in the place it 's just that we 've got to learn the right way to do it the other crops it 's returns us returns us more per hectare not really a single crop aspect but because of these crops and because of the climate we live in we can double crop which we can 't do with cane with cane ties up your area for four or five years with these other crops as the one behind me navy beans it 's only three and a half months and when we take that out we can put corn in and when we take that out we can put soybean in over christmas so the the margin the gross margin that we can expect if we do it right would probably be three times as man it came but as i said before you can 't just go into other crops and think a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double crop we 've got peanuts over it on the river we 've got a turkey beans we 've got sorghum for the seed companies to my left resources and the infrastructure that is involved in sugar cane has got to be commended the way the mills run the transport system the way the harvesters harvest the cane the way the whole system works from the time the match goes in to the time the season finished is nothing short of spectacular it is a very well oiled machine the problems with these other diverse crops is that we haven 't got the infrastructure to to back them up now my view is that the whole area should be overseen by a company that runs all aspects of the farming sector in this area doesn 't matter what the crops are and to try and get the whole process of growing crops and processing and marketing them as well oiled as the sugar side of the industry is it 's no use going into these other crops unless your margins are attractive enough and to let that fall back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard ass for people to take that risk but have we got any choice other than to set up some sort of a marketing arm or some sort of a body that investigates all avenues of return for our ground here hey i 'm charlie timer i 've been a cane farmer here in the vertical region for a number of years since the mid 60s and in recent years we 've decided to make a change over to horticulture and we grow about 4 000 mango trees in this region and egg fruit is our other main horticultural crop that we grow everything is under trickle irrigation our mango trees have undertreated micro sprinklers and we felt that we had to make the change as the sugar industry was going through some tough times we have very minimal wastage very little water loss to evaporation we try and get all the water targeted onto the roots and of course with the nutrients as well so we have very little leaching very little water wastage we have a system of moisture monitoring equipment whereby we can monitor moisture levels at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit of information on how how and when to irrigate how much to irrigate we have employed this technology over the last few years whilst it 's expensive certainly is a great way to cut cut irrigation costs because our water usage has actually been cut dramatically since installing this equipment we know exactly when to water and every day is a different day according to the uh depending on i suppose the conditions the weather conditions and how the crops are are producing on a given day and we water accordingly and of course our water usage compared to sugar cane is only a fraction megaliter usage per hectare all our water is groundwater we pump it from underground aquifer that 's one of the things i suppose the birdicon region is well known for we have a system here where we we 're virtually floating on water of course thanks to organizations like the south vertical water board that keep topping up and keep replenishing that underground from water out of the birdicon river that maintains our water levels and it minimizes salt intrusion and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organizations like the south vertical water board we would be struggling especially an area like we are here on the southern side of home hill it 's always been known that one of the driest areas and years gone by the big advantage with sandy soil the trickle tape you don 't have that water loss as we did with flood irrigating we can get even cropping now whereas years ago under sugar cane where you had different soils and soil profiles across a a given paddock cost by about 30 percent more product per hectare and a reduction of 30 in water consumption and of course we 've actually minimized fertilizer leakage down into the underground aquifer because we are targeting the roots the horticultural industry would would have to be one of the most water conscious industries around there 's another area we 're looking at at the moment is in forestry plantations we 've done a lot of work in that in that field the birdicon region is ideally suited to growing forestry plantations it 's been proven with mangoes mango trees grow well in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ australia african mahogany specifically is also another great way for people to bring into production some of their marginal land but in the past has been unproductive with crops such as sugar cane good for the environment they they certainly keep the salinity problems minimal this is one of the tree crops we 've diversified into african mahogany trees certainly very well suited to the birdicon region they grow extremely well very vigorous as you can see this this particular stand of trees here only about five months old and they are already around two meters in height it thrives on sailing conditions as well of course it is a long-term investment a 15-20 year project the way things are looking around the world with regards to timber production and the fact that a lot of native forests have been stripped plantation forestry seems to be the way to go and there certainly is a lot of backing there from state and federal governments high class timber that will fetch a very good price on the market especially in years to come these particular trees here will need some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their lives but they only require around four liters of water per tree per day they do a fantastic job in tapping into the aquifer after about four or five years these trees will become virtually self-sufficient we do have a pristine environment off our coast and this particular aquifer extends to the coast against the sea and we 're very conscious the water quality that enters the great barrier reef lagoon and the world heritage value of that reef and the surrounds that we do have we are taking every effort to achieve the goals that are set to maintain the water quality standard that people would like to see we do have to weigh that against the activities that are being performed on the land and how we can address those with practical common sense solutions so the future still looks good and apart from everything else with the current drought which does seem to have a lot of people concerned and failed wet seasons we are still very positive about our future in the water industry you,"(-19.5744451, 147.4066109)"

been inextricably linked since the dawn of time fires ignited by lightning strikes have helped regenerate the australian landscape a practice understood and perpetuated by aboriginal communities for a very very long time millennial millennia you know at least 65 000 years we 're meeting berkshire elder murray it 's like fire stick farming managing country it 's not about bushfire mitigation or things like that that 's a very simplistic view it 's about managing country insurance there 's always good food there the safe pathways many of the trees in australia won 't even germinate their seeds without a bushfire going through first so that resistant to fire so it 's a holistic approach to fire management fire 's not our friend or enemy it 's just a tool that 's there and you use it is there not a danger of a bushfire here no no that 's why we 're burning early because if we leave it like this later in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a lightning strike or a careless cigarette or something so by the earlier burns called mosaic burning i burn in patches and uh that does several things it prevents a larger bushfire spreading later because of the earlier burn and as all this grass dies on the one side this stuff i burnt earlier it 's got new nutritious green shoots coming up for animals to feed on it also creates a biodiversity pathway so the area that was unburned as that gets caught on a bushfire and can 't travel to those other animals that can at least travel through that earlier burnt country safely trained as an abc journalist yeah don 't know that against me they 're good mob but you 're also living part of the time the traditional way absolutely yeah many many majority aboriginal people lower gold for living in that lifestyle best of both worlds murren

melanis a cucumber melon yep so it 's a little wish taco good stuff you 're chewing the whole thing well bloody hell get into it mate you eat the whole thing absolutely good as any bloody cucumber you 'd find in sydney or brisbane or anywhere have another one they 're not bad actually nearby the seemingly endless soft flats that border the waters of the gulf of carpentaria are also the site of some

dugong would feed 300 people one of these followers would feed 200 people the mangrove or sea turtle and we waste nothing on them they would even eat the shell if it 's soft enough but we don 't waste

choice later is the good old-fashioned aussie bbq memories of marandu let 's give it a taste of all of berkshire 's features it 's the profound effects of nature that are most remarkable from above and below from deep deep underground 700 meters to the exact water cascades upwards to the surface in what 's known as the birdtown bore flowing straight out of the great artesian basin it reaches the surface at 68 degrees celsius and flows to surrounding marshland providing life-giving drinking water to cattle and wildlife in times of drought overhead meanwhile there 's another phenomenon of nature that 's found here in berkshire you 're watching the morning glory cloud a rare meteorological event that can be seen here in september and october this thin line of cloud rolls in at a very low altitude often only a hundred meters above the ground and stretches for up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bergton who 's flown around it many times it usually sets in around the end of september to about late november if you 're lucky you might spot them in october but yeah the morning glory clouds probably the biggest attraction of burke town they call the morning glory clouds of course for the morning you know they they want much more pronounced in the morning due to the saturation of the air and it 's actually one of the only places in the whole world that you get to experience morning glory clouds what 's created this formation so basically when the two air masses collide head on what takes place is known as convection as these air masses rise and temperature drops and there 's enough saturation in the air we get the amazing morning glory cloud chris 's flights also take him along the shoreline bordering the gulf of carpentaria this is the coastline broken up by dozens of rivers and creeks forming an artistic pattern best observed from up high here in the dry season salt pan stretch for hundreds of kilometers covered by water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful sight to see and you know during the seasons we get tourists come out up from down south and we take them out on scenics and they get to witness it and experience the amazing scenery not only the salt pans we 're watching so many creeks not only the albert river but so many other major rivers alongside that close to it but also smaller rivers flowing into the gulf of carpentaria they 're mighty big these cattle stations up around the gulf exploring further afield in berkshire we check out some of the huge cattle stations up here around the gulf this one gregory downs is a quarter of a million hectares three times as big as canberra it 's centered around the banks of the permanently flowing gregory river 85 kilometers of river frontage meaning there 's water aplenty for the 30 000 brahmin cattle here the station homestead is a picture of abundance with flowering gardens and lawns aplenty for the youngsters to pass a rugby ball further north on the banks of the leicard river sits another imposing cattle property florabill station this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 50 years ernie 's a fixture here he 's been the mayor for four terms good day i 'm ernie camp mayor of berkshire welcome to the shire floraville your property that 's correct well the family property yes so you 'd know the gulf territory and raising cattle very well yeah i like i believe i do and of course you 're running cattle here how many uh we 're running a little bit lighter than usual at the moment but around about 8 000. so you 're basically a cattle farmer how is life on the land it has been quite good cattle prices are the best so me ernie 's floorbill station has been the site of some big fossil fires ernie himself has uncovered bones from a giant dye proton oh in this place here exactly where we 're standing here our dough proton was found the most complete species of the diplorodon and then interesting when they did recover the skeleton they actually found some teeth of the megalania which was quite a large lizard much the same size they 're actually a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would have been a giant lizard like the komodo dragon that 's actually attacked the diprotodon and left some of its teeth that 's right scavenger of course so yes it wouldn 't be the place to go candy later this morning ernie takes me for a chopper ride around floriville here 's the leica falls an opportunity to fly low and slow over a flow that makes its way to the nearby gulf of carpentaria at pretty low at the moment but when full flood it 's it 's 11 meters above those falls downstream flocks of brogas wing skywards they 're the largest water bird in southeastern australia with flocks numbering up to 12 000 birds and then finally to put this chopper to work we 're going to round up some of your cattle some of your 8000 head of cattle yeah well a certain move didn 't move eight out of head but we wanted to give a paddock a spell so we moved him from one paddock to into another paddock to let that paddock recover oh we run a bit of everything uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to the harsh conditions of the golf with stock numbers fluctuating depending on the season it 's good times now because after five years of devastating drought the rains have fallen in abundance grass for the cattle to feed on is at last flourishing later that day ernie takes me to one of queensland 's most scenic national parks vood magella surrounding the picturesque lornhill gorge a vibrant ribbon of green through the surrounding plains this outback oasis is a favorite for people wanting to canoe its cool waters [Music] for me it 's an opportunity to be pummeled below its short but powerful waterfalls for ernie this is a true outback paradise the waters come from springs and they come from the uh the table out the barclay table and uh again bordering the queensland and northern territory border so there 's a lovely falls here of a couple of meters i can get underneath the water there and refresh myself after all this walking yeah the falls is actually built up in a centre with tufa and tufa is basically um the water here is full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the water steady down on those logs and create a substance that does look like rocks there 's no doubt that berkshire is tiny in many respects just 550 people live here and yet the shire punch is well above its weight in so many ways take innovation the council has just won a top award for innovation for its innovative work on health and safety training during the four-month covert lockdown where no one was allowed in or out of the shire hi we 're the marshall sisters and we love berktown because of the lifestyle the council is also helping residents to raise finance to buy their own houses the council through our ceo claire keenan was able to speak to westpac and get him on board to lend money out here to help us buy our own houses so it 's been a great initiative and then there 's the passport yes berkshire is introducing a passport murrendu was embracing that with the executive behind all these innovations their kingdom we 're bringing them back and it 's to support our small businesses that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut but it also gives people a sense of community it gives people a sense of belonging it 'll educate them to what we have here and they will always feel part of us and they 'll always have that sense of loyalty one of the many local businesses taking part in this new passport program is the tirana roadhouse where owner jill wilson is today nursing an orphaned agile wallaby this is ruby our wallaby her mother got killed in a car accident and tourists brought her in here and she was quite large and had fur and that 's you know a good indication that they can survive so we kept her and fed her some special room milk and yeah now she just lives here and and enjoys coming into my kitchen asking for a carrot every now and again jill 's home is almost a zoo so many animals here the passing families love to interact with yeah we 've got some animals here that we love and care for and yeah we 've got one of each and adding to the to the menagerie every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a guard dog they follow out every time they see someone we 've got pigs chicken ponies turkeys and the wallaby [Music] as for the passport program we hope that we get to see and meet a lot of tourists that are coming into australia and as part of the passport program they can collect stamps here at toronto and they will also collect a freebie that we 're working on with council and the shire and yeah that gives them an opportunity to visit every business in the shire and see what 's out there [Music] around burketown there are many local businesses who are taking part in this new passport program among them savannah lodge this is like a resort in bali tropical gardens long trails winding through the rainforest and an outdoor bar for guests to chill out in owner operator here is amanda wilkinson we 've been here for 30 years now which sounds a long time wow so a big part of your life and there 's obviously some appeal here oh it 's a beautiful place to be yes a lovely area and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no turning back and the reasons three big reasons for living here for living here just the natural beauty of the place and the environment and what we 've created here too which is close to our heart close to your heart i gotta say it 's close to my heart i feel like i 'm in bali if you 've created such a tropical atmosphere yes it is it 's a big surprise to everyone that comes here as for the passport program i think the purpose of the passport is that somebody will come here they get a little stamp in their passport so people quite like to to gather up things like that and with that they also get a souvenir and a discount on a meal or a free drink fantastic well thanks again for having me here really enjoyed it been here a week good stay here in our next episode we 'll return to berkshire for some celebrations it 's the annual race day in the township of gregory and it 's not just the horses that are racing there 's a bush dance

dance all ahead in this episode of traveloz hello welcome i 'm greg granger [Music] there 's a real buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking forward to this event for a long time and their excitement is palpable it is all go here this afternoon absolutely gregory downs have obviously just opened this brand new facility upgrading the facilities to covert last year they couldn 't open so this is the year hence why we 're expecting such a big crowd people have come here from all over australia i 've spoken to people that have traveled from adelaide we have someone here from phillip island so

which is amazing we 've got fashions of the field for kids up to adults i 'm always excited to come along to a race meet i feel like it 's just such a great boost for the economy in small towns and i think it just helps for places like gregory on the map going on bit with the strength bet pre-race the first horses are being paraded just eight jockeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm seeing here yeah good fleet of jockeys yep we had a good roll-up we had eight jockeys so that 's that 's a good number for us good number because those eight jockeys they 're going to be racing almost every race aren 't they yeah yeah they won 't get many brakes in the stalls and they 're off racing just as horses here have raced for more than a century all eyes are on the track the putters are up fleet this is their biggest mass celebration since before covered restrictions kicked in across the line on the winning putters of jubilant watching the horses race is one thing but these annual race days and a small settlement like gregory are much more than horses what about passion kelly stevenson is rallying the crowds for a series of fashion parades first the kids then [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for the winners but there 's an even bigger event to cap the day off the calcutta auction we also have what 's called a calcutta where people can get involved to actually run themselves we auction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the royal flying doctor service as well very worthwhile absolutely worthwhile gotta make a bid gotta join in here any higher than 450. 570 [Applause] these runners are then directed to the same stores where the horses start they go to race from the stores along the horse track main first [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] all good fun in the annual gregory race meeting daisy sees some lively evening entertainment in the form of a bush dance here 's where the ringers get to release a year 's worth of print-out promotion from all that bull wrangling let the classics ring out as gregory 's annual race meeting comes to an upbeat conclusion i set you free [Music] [Music] we 're on highway one road that runs right around australia and surprise surprise up here the road is still dirt we 're on the border with the northern territory in a place that 's been given the unholy name of hell 's gate amidst the giant boulders that line the road i recall just why it 's been given this god-forbidden name in the very early days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come through here on foot on horseback droving they 'd be escorted escorted by police the police would make sure they were safe to this point but no more this was the farewell point they had to travel all the way through to catherine in the northern territory bye bye take care you 're on your own because this was named the gates of hell hell 's gate so what exactly is here these days at hell 's gate here 's a couple who may tell me the owners of hell 's gate john and jenny hayes it was a goat track you know we came through here 29 years ago and it was it was just bulldust from here to the border you could get through but just [Music] our neighbours came here i think it was 40 something years ago they drove through here couldn 't get out to westmoreland they drove a tractor out with his wife new wife so it took him two days john and jenny are running two distinctly different businesses here a cattle property and a roadhouse they feel an obligation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but both are all consuming so you 've bought not just a roadhouse at hell 's gate you bought a big cattle property well it 's not big in terms of some of the places around here but yeah it 's 422 000 acres sounds big to me yeah and you 're running what six thousand head of cattle well not yet we 'll run that six thousand breeders seven thousand breeders but we 're at this stage about three running around here with the name like hell 's gate john and jenny are playing up the theme check out the signs and the laboratories and what about the drink cooler it 's a coffin one of the features here is the waterhole fed by the waters of the great artesian basin and a big drawcard for birds getting to hell 's gate no longer has to be on foot most travelers arrive by car or van but make sure you refuel its 320 ks to the next petrol station and prices are off the clock two dollars a liter for some flying into the hills gate international airport is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed a heavenly stopper a lot of people come through the gates there where where the hellscope originated from and the name and then they get here and see all the green grass and they said i don 't understand why it 's called hell 's goat when they see when when they get here because it 's true it 's not hell really at all no no slice of nice heaven here but it 's lovely but the name is the gimmick the name gets people in well it does and if you stay here tonight you 'll probably want to stay forever mate so it 's one of those things hell 's gate i made it i made it should i stay in hell hell 's gate it 's not that bad mate is it fishing is big in bergton and there 's no bigger fisherman than johnny yana better known by his initials jay wine we 're heading out today with johnny on the albert river he 's a man he was born under a tree and lived all his life here he says there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have an agreement oh i don 't have any problem with them well i got an agreement with them they leave me alone and i leave them alone so they know not to come near me i suppose they could use me for a toothpick if they really wanted that johnny has a tongue-in-cheek solution if he were to be attacked and when he opened his mouth just stick your arm straight down his throat and grab him by the tail turn him inside out first on johnny 's agenda is to catch some bait now that means stepping onto the muddy banks of the albert river but not to fear hopefully the giant saudis will remember their agreement that goes the net time and time again and then they come potty mullet perfect bait for the fish waiting to be snagged then in go the lines and almost straight away the head has been bitten off the bait probably by a shark [Music] next throw johnny actually does catch a shark then it comes in it comes and then bango off it goes well i think he bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little fella there 'd be some bigger fellas out there oh yeah these are rich fishing grounds as johnny proves with his next cast there 's a strike almost straight away in waters teaming with barramundi today he snagged a blue salmon [Music] first catch of the day calls for some photos this fishing we 've worked up an appetite johnny 's going to cook his catch the indigenous way i 'm sure he 's quick to build a raging fire and onto the ashes goes the salmon then a bit of mangrove leaves serves as a plate 30 minutes out of the water and it 's ready to eat caught and cooked in record time life doesn 't get any better no paradise the hot dry savanna just to the south of berkshire has known the world over for its abundant deposits of fossils we 're rigorously arguably one of the richest fossil sites in the world now this here once was the bottom the bottom of a lake and all around us it 's eroded eroded right down here exposing tens of thousands of fossils any wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been dazzled by the fines here amazing fossils preserved in the most exquisite detail among those working on those fines is fossil lab technician alan ragham this is d-site one of the 230 sites that we have there are millions of tons of tertiary limestone full of bones and this was once the bottom of a freshwater lake a huge amount of erosion has occurred and with that erosion fossils have been exposed yes d-site is one of the most important sites at riverside full of bones and fossils alan shows me a life-size depiction of one such find a giant bird known as dromunitheda it was the largest bird in the world full metres tall and only found here in australia today alan shows me a rock carrying fossilized bones of one of these birds what we have here that his lower limb bone these are his toe bones that 's his gizzard he had to be alive he 's walked into shallow water he 's got bogged he struggled to get out he 's completely buried himself and when he 's died and decomposed the mud has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very special fossil elsewhere here in riverslee i 'm guided to more amazing fossil finds by rod lomo now how 's this we 've got a perfectly preserved turtle shell shell yep this is a the shell of a turtle was about a meter wide it had a meter shell on him and the weird thing about this this creature had horns in his head like a cow over here we 've got a clock crocodile skull have a look there 's his nose boned there yeah there 's a tooth there yeah there 's another tooth there big teeth oh yeah and there 's some cavities coming down the skull when you see the head it 's only about one tenth of the size of the crocodile so there you 're looking at about a ten foot croc close to riversley is the buchamata national park with the scenic lawn hill gorge we visited here in the last episode but today rod lomo wants to show me yet more features alright quite stunning up here in the lawn hill national park we 've got this deep red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate this this would be one of australia 's icons you know here we have this water coming out of this uh basin up here it flows all year round you know endless supply of water through here all this the the palm trees right throughout here the bandanas the different species of trees and and plants it 's all an attraction to water which we have here an abundance of it the moment we arrived here we saw this one hell of a big salt water fresh water crocodile fresh water coffee right fresh water coffee oh we got no salties in this area yeah you 'll only see them if they want you to see them and they 're quite harmless they 're natural food of live fish [Music] now wonderful way for us to explore this is by camus we can come right up through these gorges and then with the way you get the feel of it well when you 're paddling through the gorge and having big red sandstone walls coming right up against you like that green and the beauty of it just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plants and and different types of plants as it goes through the gorge just hanging just clinging to the rock well certainly i 'm enjoying this paddle today we 're able to come right up to the uh to the face of one of these cascades this has got a name yeah this is the indari falls and this this hole in darwin falls is about a two meter high waterfall and you 'll see all the different falls cascading of course into the middle gorge it 's a wonderful place to go swimming right up against the cascade natural spa get underneath these waterfalls and have them on top of you it 's just spectacular there 's something else again there 's an abundance of beautiful flowers around lawn hill red beach gravy wattle and a native hibiscus known as desert rope what have we got here right here we have the fruit of the emu apple tree the red rosy little apple is on there edible it is made but either we 're they 're like that now oh god it 's sour plenty of termite mounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termites tell me why the termites build towers as tall as these ones this mound is actually like a an air conditioning unit like inside there there 's regulated temperature and a regulated humidity now these little termites need that to survive [Music] another waterway closer to the gulf is the site of a true aussie paddling classic today we 're watching as paddlers assemble for an event tied to the horse race meeting we attended earlier an event called saddles and paddles the paddlers are gathered on the banks of the gregory river with alison whited the starter how 's it looking this year alison numbers are fantastic greg the northwest canoe club have been running the gregory river canoe marathon for 46 years now now this is an interesting river because it 's not a big white water river but there 's still some tricky parts there certainly are we have a couple of areas that are classed with great shoe rapids so there is a tiny little bit that most people get stuck because there 's some really long lagoons out there and they have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from all over australia majority are from queensland so 20 from atherton and the tableland the sunny coasters always bring a strong contingent and uh i think they 're race favorites this year man is going to miss out on bragging rights two courses to be paddled down the gregory today a long course and a shorter one both with sharp corners that mean many paddlers will get a dunking [Music] the long course is 42 kilometers and the short course is 18 kilometers and it starts from checkpoint 3. well for both contenders it 's going to be a good experience a good challenge yes it certainly is it 's a lovely day out here um the water 's going to be perfect it would be nice to go for a swim on shore one particularly tricky corner is known as kenny 's crossing this is a natural spring fed river that comes all the way from about 100 kilometers from here comes up out of the ground it comes through absolutely beautiful country and uh and there 's twisting and turning there 's trees there 's uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have five kilometer lagoons honestly you know we classed as an iconic race in australia there 's probably three iconic races in australia one the murray one the avenue and definitely the gregory it 's on everybody 's uh everybody 's bucket [Applause] over the downstream the short course contenders are in the water beautifully scenic long stretches to enjoy and then fast flowing scratches logs and branches provide obstacles that challenge many early afternoon sees the first paddlers reach the finish line and first over the fastest of the short course contenders it 's john van wright from marieba that was a job there 's a great race as usual uh greg a lot of competitors i just did the short race this year um which was a lot of fun it 's a 17k it 's my 35th race so i 've done a fair few of them how old are you now i 'm 54. that 's pretty good for a 54 year old i see a lot of old fellas and old girls on this race no it 's a great sport you can sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60s 70s next ian ross johnston how was it ah great thing great fun it 's just an awesome course such it 's so beautiful up there and so much fun just to pick your way through it all you 've come in second and uh there were a lot of obstacles that i saw but you 've got through without going over no i had a couple of fall ins along the way it wouldn 't be it wouldn 't be so much fun if you didn 't have a few falling almost 70 and yet you 're uh taking part in this event like you 're a young man yeah well that 's what that 's what paddling does for you it takes years off your age but it 's ross 's wife jenny who sums up the high emotions of this event i came to the top of the rapid and and i had a little panic and then i thought no don 't panic you 've got to get it so i had my boat i started to come down towards it and then just out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up and swung around in an eddie and then i had to pull my way back up the rapids with my paddle my steering had come off so i flipped the boat over put the steering back on and got in and i was fine yes the gregory river canoe marathon and aussie paddling classic [Music] our time in berkshire is coming to an end out on the endless soft flats bordering the gulf of carpentaria there 's time to reflect on the special qualities of this place this to me is one of the most beautiful places in the world it 's ever-changing if you can walk here you can walk 30 kilometers to the sea in our dry season and in the wet this is an inland sea it is an absolutely spectacular part of the world it is quiet and peaceful and you live so close to nature that you actually just feel part of it certainly the locals of berkshire share a deep affection for this their home i 've been in berktown for 14 years i love the place the people and the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the lifestyle beautiful place to be it 's a lovely area and yeah we 've made this our home and um yeah no turning back for many locals like aboriginal actor alec berkshire has been in their family for a long long time alec what 's your connection with berktown ah well i got a long history here my grandmother who was an old ganga little woman were from the barramundi dreaming out here in a place called guna mulla and in the 1930s she came here they brought her here the missionaries because she was a i guess a savage i like to call her but she came here and this is where my grandmother um in the early 1930s through until the 40s lived for the indigenous locals shaped over thousands of years and deeply ingrained and practiced to this day as for the forces of nature here the springtime arrival of the awesome morning glory clouds is a phenomenon experienced in few other places a wonder of nature like so much else here that sets berkshire apart slowly thoroughly enjoyed my time in berkshire sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next episode of travellers we 're traveling south all over the southern parts of outback queensland in the meantime i 'm greg granger happy travels travel away you,"(-17.7422259, 139.5479392)"

Australia",5275,um yes so welcome everyone uh thank you for coming to hear about our climate change strategy i 'm sophie barrett the sustainability coordinator at cancer regional council i 'd like to also introduce daniel stronggrove our strategy and energy management advisor and will mcdonald our sustainability officer we 'll be talking to you today about the climate change strategy and hopefully answering some of your questions at the end so the format of today is that we 're going to present to you about the strategy and then we 'll have about 20 minutes for question and answer at the end so please um write your questions into the chat and um we 'll make sure that we answer those at the end we 're also recording this so if you do have any issues with this please put it in the chat it 's just for people who are unable to make it so i 'll just start by acknowledging the traditional owners of this country including the jabba kai yura kanji people i think i pronounced that one wrong but all other first people who live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional custodians in the region in the development of this and other climate related strategies and are very keen to be working with traditional custodians on the implementation we 're also currently preparing a caring for country section of the strategy which is not in this version but we 'll be going out and we 're getting feedback from those groups and getting some quotes from them about where they see cans in terms of climate action by 2030 so the strategy is available on our climate change page on the cairns regional council website there 's it 's basically broken up into some front material which is about the purpose and vision outlines our commitments talks a bit about our emissions reduction and then outlines a number of actions across a number of industry focus areas so we 'll be taking you through this um now so to give you a bit of an idea of the content so in terms of the vision of the strategy um council is intending to be leaders in mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change and the main four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green economy prioritizing a healthy natural environment building resilient informed low emissions communities and also embedding climate change considerations throughout our organisation and operations so we have four big commitments as part of this strategy and these underpin all of the actions in the strategy so number one is the net zero emissions for council operations by 2030 so this is an ambitious uh target for council and builds on our previous work which daniel will talk to you about in a moment we also have another commitment for council electricity to be supplied from 100 renewable energy sources the third one is to prepare council in the community to adapt and prosper in a changing climate and also to support the community progress towards the state emission targets so i 'll now hand over to daniel who talked to you a bit about the our missions journey hey thanks sophie um so obviously this is quite small um if you have this open on the web browser in front of you you can um choose to zoom in to see more detail in these segments that may be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal to achieve um to reduce its emissions by 50 by 2020 so if you have a look at the graph in middle of the page there oh yeah there it is great thanks yes thanks look at this graph here you can see how council has tracked its progress um from its 2008 uh 2007 and 08 baseline year towards that target you can see we 've actually kind of haven 't quite reached it but we 've been very close to the last or since 2014 and 15. the challenge we 've faced is that while we have been taking efforts to improve energy efficiency and reduce fugitive emissions we 've also been building new big facilities such as cpac and new materials recovery facility and upgrading art galleries and all sorts of improvements in terms of facilities but they 're all energy-intensive improvements we also in 2010 uh opened the new wastewater treatment plants the cleaner seized treatment plants that process all the storage that 's in cairns and they have much improved quality of outflow water which is great in terms of reducing the impacts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came at a cost of much they 're much more energy intensive processes that are used there so that also increase the energy consumption considerably so the main things that have been done um were the capping and flaring of the landfill of portsmouth to reduce the methane from that landfill there was the wastewater and plant upgrades i mentioned and then we 've been doing lots of work in terms of energy efficiency and installing behind the meter solar on a lot of facilities we 've now installed around three megawatts of of solar which has reduced emission reduced our energy consumption reduced our emissions and it 's also saved a lot of money so all of those solar systems have been installed um and yeah they 're sort of really um financially rewarding as well which is good um so yeah just i think yes this is good slides come to one thing i 'd like to point out is that in the past we 've just considered the emissions associated with our operations so that 's for those of you familiar with this sort of terminology around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions which are the missions from the fuels we 've burned for our fleet and you know backup generators things like that and the emissions from the scope 2 emissions from our electricity consumption so uh electricity obviously they 're you know we 're buying it from ergon but then they 're um they 're burning the coal on our behalf so moving forwards you you 'll see that number one commitment was that council was going to aiming having to be carbon neutral by 2030. when we talk about that what we 're talking about is looking at our scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 emissions so the scope 3 emissions are the emissions associated with all our contracts all those suppliers that provide services on our behalf but that for which we don 't have direct control it also can include things such as the leased facilities the council doesn 't necessarily directly manage but we own the the buildings so this sort of new target is actually far more difficult than the original target we set and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our suppliers in understanding the emissions associated with with delivering us services such as the waste management processes um you 're like the contractors providing concrete pipes and bitumen and all those sorts of materials so we started those conversations with our larger suppliers and um you know i think there 's a general agreement that it 's it 's an important step that we take um for the the planet as well and for our region and there 's a willingness to um take you know take this path what we found um the work that we did as part of this strategy was to understand what the scale of those scope 3 missions were because we hadn 't ever tracked them before and the initial estimates we have suggest that this far more significant than the emissions from the direct operations that we manage ourselves so we 're talking about um the direct operations we 've accounted for in the past only been about 20 of our total emissions associated with delivering all of our services to the community um so if you have a look we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that we can take on this pathway to net zero um i won 't go through all of them in detail but the general approach is that we 're going to do all that we can to reduce our emissions um through things like purchasing 100 renewable energy renewable electricity we 'll look to electrify our fleet electrify any other fuel consuming equipment and we 'll obviously continue to look at improve efficiency within our operations once we 've done what we can to reduce our emissions we 'll then look at options for offsetting that 's sort of the last sort of step we take and we 're looking to offset through projects that deliver a whole range of benefits for the region not just reducing missions but also things like improving you know enviro have environmental or social co-benefits we 'll talk more about that in the when we look at the action section and then our the natural environment focus area so the other thing that we 've um taken a look at is to understand we we know in detail what our council emissions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions within our entire community of this local government area so with you this is a a estimate of the emissions for the cairns local government area which is provided to us by ironbark sustainability which is a specialist um consultancy that do this sort of work for a lot of councils around australia and so we have an estimate there of what is the total emissions within our area and where those what are the sources of emissions and you can see there that electricity and transport are the largest sectors so as the electricity grid in queensland becomes more and more sourced from renewable energy of course that those electricity emissions will reduce and as we uh see the you know fleets in queensland or and uh vehicles in general in queensland becoming electrified then that will also see a reduction in those transport emissions right so today yeah so um great so in preparing this strategy we wanted to sort of identify actions that we could take in different sort of focus areas within um within the sort of i guess the human habitat that is cairns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry looking at how we run businesses in in cairns we 're looking at the energy supply chain we 're looking at transport built environment and natural environment so we 've teased out the specific actions with each of those six focus areas that we um believe council has uh either a means to take some direct action to uh have some sort of influence or that we can influence through things like advocacy okay excuse me it 's gonna pull up my community page so i can see it more detail so oh there we go thanks that 's good sophie so the with all of the actions we 're recognizing there 's two sort of key areas we need to focus one is mitigation and one is adaptation so in the community sector we 've identified uh objectives and actions that are focusing on how we can assist the community at large to transition to a low emissions the community and we 're also looking at how what what needs to be done to improve the resiliency of the local cancer community as far as it needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low or net zero emissions community council has a limited ability to influence that because it 's really decisions made at state or federal level that have the biggest impact on where the electricity that supplies the entire community comes from or um you know dictates the types of housing that should be built but we are we have so if you read through those actions you 'll see the actions that we 've identified where council can play a meaningful role um so as far as zero emissions is concerned one thing we are as you 've seen we 've tried we 're trying to quantify what the emissions are of our community through an emissions inventory and that provides us with some direction as to what you know these sort of big ticket items that we should focus on in terms of trying to assist the community to produce submissions we 're also looking at grants events and programs that council can support to help the community to transition to net zero so for example there is a net zero cans community group that council has funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be very active in the community in the in the near future also you know council organize events such as eco fiesta which is an opportunity to bring the community together to share information knowledge inspiration to assist the community to make changes in our day-to-day lives and also we we have in the past done community engagement programs to sort of help educate and that 's something that we will continue to do and in terms of resiliency council is very active in the disaster management space also well sophie in particular has been very involved recently in the coastal hazards adaptation developing the coastal hazards adaptation strategy which is um i think sophie you 'll talk more about that in the build environment section as well but obviously that understanding what are the risks to coastal communities from the impacts of climate change and coastal hazards is important to help the resiliency of those communities we 're also considering things such as food security what will be the potential impacts through into you know on the one hand we have to consider you know intense events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be cut off and potentially have a disruption to the food supply networks that 's one aspect of food security but then there 's also i guess other aspects of longer term impacts from climate change on on the food supply system and as sophie mentioned the traditional custodians have really expressed a lot of interest or concern about the impacts of climate change and want to be involved in identifying solutions for their communities and another key aspect that has been raised and discussed a lot is the health impacts of climate change through you know more heat wave events um and i guess we 're particularly concerned about those impacts for on those communities that um maybe are less prepared you know in a lot of socioeconomic communities where they don 't necessarily have as easy or you know the cost of electricity and access to air conditioned spaces is essentially more difficult for them um but if i ask you to just read through that read through the actions there and uh maybe you would like to sort of provide some comments back to us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um industry reactions so i mentioned to you that um as council we 're looking at our scope 3 emissions which is really our supply chain so we see that one of the biggest levers we can pull as council is to basically um assist our suppliers to make the shift to providing lower emissions products and services so where 's that we 've started this this journey of sustainable procurement where we quantify the emissions associated with all those all the suppliers the emissions associated supplies to their services and we 're going to work with those suppliers so we can educate them and assist or be educated by them too i mean we need to understand this is uh we 're all on this journey together but we have a number of years before our target date of 2030 to be net zero so we have we have time to prepare all of our suppliers to make this transition so i guess the other thing is what is recognized is that um globally we 're seeing a shift to a more low emissions um economy so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries will be penalized if they 're also high emissions if that 's from high mission sources so yeah on the one hand there may be penalties from if if people aren 't making this transition to a low emissions economy but on the other hand there 's business opportunities for those businesses that are making this shift so um i guess that this this ties into the idea of cairns establishing itself as a smart green economy where we look to transition uh industries away away from uh i guess the thing in cairns of course is that we don 't necessarily have it 's not like we 're in other parts of queensland where we have a coal industry that we 're dependent upon but we can look at ways that we can improve the way we deliver our existing uh industries so we 're looking we 're talking with um advice for ttmq to understand how we can and they 're doing lot of work on in this space to understand how those tour operators that are taking tourists to experience these wonderful world heritage areas can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know demonstrating that we are good custodians of this these spaces as well um sophie did you want to talk any more about the this micro economy work that you 're that you 've been involved with um yes just quickly we 're also um yeah commencing work on mapping out a road map for cairns and final queensland as a smart green economy so we will be looking at identifying the key opportunities um and and of road map to activating um further activating the smart green economy um including looking at the circular economy for council and the community as well so we are sort of kicking off some more work in this space so there 'll be um some workshops around this and um we 'll be involving there 's quite a lot of momentum in the industry at the moment around this and a lot of people quite interested so that group is kind of moving this forward as well not just council but industry stakeholders as well so we 'll be coming back to you in the future with a bit more information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think that the key opportunity is that um as we 're seeing the uh northern renewable energy zone uh be developed there 's gonna be a lot of new renewable energy projects built in this region at this point in time this region actually uh 75 of the electricity requirements in this region are already supplied by renewable energy so as those new projects get built we 'll see this this region become a net exporter of renewable energy to the rest of queensland so as a council we recognize that we can support this transition by directly purchasing electricity from these new developments so in our case we 're looking to purchase electricity from a new wind farm that 's soon to be under constructed so hence we have the option to purchase 100 renewable locally generated electricity and of course we as i mentioned we are looking at uh always improving energy efficiency through things you know there 's there 's a great opportunity there with all our buildings to continue to improve the efficiency of how they run and demonstrate best practice energy efficiency in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking with ergon about led upgrades of all the street lights and things like that and then i guess we can do what is we know what we can do with our own operations we also see there 's an opportunity there for us to also work to advocate um within the region and uh also to provide education all right sophie that 's thanks yeah so i 'll um i 'll just pick up okay i love you thanks yeah great thanks daniel um another key area as daniel mentioned is uh transport so and that was i think our second biggest pie on the community emissions chart there after energy so there are a lot of opportunities as daniel said not all of it is under council 's control but um where we can help support that transition we will help take actions in these areas so around that transition to zero emissions transport this is about like how we can help encourage the transition to electric uh vehicles uh not only passenger vehicles but um but fleet um and also other um transport and things like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with other um industry stakeholders to help progress some of these actions as well around that transition to zero emissions um it 's also about that transport network so there 's an action in there about developing um an integrated sustainable transport strategy for the region in collaboration with partners such as tmr and others and also considering mobility as a service so um so this is things like the that sort of last mile connections um things like um electric bikes scooters and how they fit into that transport piece as well as i mean we 'll be seeing that this area is rapidly changing so we 'll be seeing you know things like autonomous vehicles um as these things become more widely adopted we 'll we 'll be seeing how we can help the community to transition to these types of transport and also planning for better networks we 're also kicking off a growth management strategy at the moment so one of the studies that will feed into that plan for cans for 2050 is looking at transport and where those key centers are so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create business centres and transport nodes to encourage people to use public transport going forward the natural environment is a big one for our region so in terms of the natural environment there 's two sort of parts of it there 's you know getting a resilient natural environment to make sure that we have that sustainable environment going forward and also using those natural methods to capture carbon to reduce the emissions in the atmosphere so under the the resilient climate and thriving natural environment our goal there is to be leaders in land biodiversity and catchment management so we are actually looking at focusing a bit more on looking at sort of things like biodiversity corridors um catchment management so looking at catchment-based based approaches to our suburbs and how we can improve those natural ecosystem services it 's also looking at reducing the land-based impacts of our community on the reef and catchments and biodiversities so so looking at those waterways particularly and how they can we can lessen the impacts on the reef and working with and learning from traditional custodians in this area so um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custodians have groups have land and sea ranger programs so um that traditional knowledge and expertise is really important to consider in coming up with different solutions to build resilience into our natural environment in terms of capturing carbon in our natural environment we 'll be investigating some of the local carbon offsets as well like opportunities around here either on council land or in collaboration with partners um daniel mentioned about offsetting you know our emissions you know 2030 so once we 've done some of those things to improve efficiency and so forth um and and we 're looking at opportunities and local markets and having how we can help support the green economy that we mentioned earlier by encouraging you know the development of these carbon projects because given that a lot of companies and governments have 20 30 targets there 's going to be a big demand in this area for carbon offsets so our region in terms of the climate council did a clean jobs um plan recently and that was one of the key opportunities identified for fun north queensland was was sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll be looking at is regenerative agriculture as well so how we can you know capture soil carbon and improve our practices of things like composting and so forth and the last sector we have is the built environment sector so the built environment sector is quite a large contributor to community emissions so in terms of this the two parts that daniel mentioned earlier we are looking to help transition to low emissions infrastructure for council and also supporting the community um to have low emissions buildings as well so that 's looking at our own facilities um and also low emissions construction materials but also supporting supporting the community and industry through guidelines and events so we do have some guidelines like the um the tropical urbanism planning policy and the cool homes guide and things like that but it 's about building on those and also supporting events like sustainable house day which we support annually and other events to actually raise awareness but it 's also looking at how we can help advocate for improvements i know the building industry is looking at going towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know through for builders and homeowners to sort of say what does this mean on a local basis so we 'll be providing um sort of staying in touch with all that and providing information out to the community and helping support that industry as well in terms of building a climate resilient built-in environment um we will be looking at incorporating climate risk resilience into planning and urban design so so making sure that we are aware of climate risks when we 're developing our planning schemes um when we 're designing our cities addressing coastal hazards so daniel mentioned that earlier so we have also developed a coastal hazard adaptation strategy which looks at coastal hazard impacts from now until 2100 and we have a long-term plan on how we 'll manage those impacts over time so you can have look at that document as well on our website also providing guidance to build resilience in the built environment and addressing urban heat island effects so we 've already started some work in this space with an urban heat study and we have about 80 sensors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using that data and and mapping our urban heat island effect and looking at how we can actually um make improvements and reduce that urban heat island effect and also providing you know collaborative plans to work with other stakeholders on how we actually manage heat events and and how we respond as a community working with nature to protect and restore our cities and suburbs so this is this came out quite strongly in our engagement um you know people wanted to see you know is rewilding the city using using natural systems and bringing back nature into our cities and valuing the um how those systems work in an inner city environment so this will be things like you know looking at our canopy cover having some programs around urban greening and some targets there looking at nature-based solutions to addressing coastal hazards so how can we strengthen our coastal areas through revegetation strengthening dunes mangroves and things like that integrated catchment management plans so this is when we actually will be looking at you know that catchment approach i mentioned earlier and you know looking at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catchment manage flooding in the future or like coastal hazards like things like sea level rise where does that water go how are we going to to use the value of that catchment and and make sure those catchments are resilient but then also how do those catchphrase link in with the community so um we 've already started a little bit of work around this in saltwater creek catchment but there 's lot of opportunities in this area as we have lots of waterways in through the city um water sensitive urban design is obviously a big one the other one is biodiversity corridors and enhancing connectivity of these so understanding you know to to have resilience for our habitats and our ecosystems it 's like we need that connectivity um and we need to make sure that those are well connected and and restore those those where they 're degraded as well so and we 'll be working with our natural resources team on that one as well uh and the final one is planning for sustainable growth so i mentioned earlier that we were looking at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cans at 2050 with a population of 300 000 people so um this will require like some careful planning and there 's a number of studies that will be feeding into this growth management plan but we 'll be looking at all hazards approach to planning so making sure that we consider all of those hazards so things like bushfire landslide cyclone flooding coastal hazards and heat etc and and mapping those and making sure that we are planning to you know be resilient to those and also not put people in in high-risk areas or help make those areas more resilient to the impacts of climate change we 'll also be planning energy efficient infrastructure for the community that minimizes impacts that natural environment so um when we are looking at investing in large infrastructure projects making sure that you know that is the consideration is there for you know what emissions these will produce and that that 's part of our decision making in our large infrastructure investment projects as well so in terms of next steps um as i mentioned earlier this engagement will be open from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council endorsed the draft strategy to go out up until the 31st of january january there is a um a your say page on our website so it 's under our website under climate change just search for climate change we are we 'll be then changing um making any changes we need to in early 2022 and endorsing the plan around february march next year and then obviously implementing the plan following that you,"(-16.9203476, 145.7709529)"

beauty shop i became a hairdresser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why i really wanted to put um hairdressers in my book so on the island on the edge of the world and the moroccan daughter there 's two characters uh b and charlie and they 're a grandmother and a granddaughter charlie is a girl and she 's the granddaughter i wanted to i wanted you i wanted to tell the story from the perspective of a hairdresser like i i i think hairdressers are fun um all the hairdressers i 've ever known are fun and bee 's this quirky uh hairdresser hairdresser that is kind of a mystical uh big turbans in her hair that sort of thing and she 's older and so i thought that 's kind of fun my mom was a hairdresser i 'm a hairdresser my son is a hairdresser granted a very very bad hairdresser but he 's still a hairdresser so we 're three generations of hairdressers so they say write what you know so i thought that would really be fun and you know what a beauty shop is home to me and so like right now i can pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from behind the chair i love a beauty shop i love the sounds of a beauty shop people would say what is your favorite what brings you that really comfortable feeling some people say oh when i walk into my mom 's house and she 's baking bread or she 's making cookies for me it was the smell of perm solution and color and the sounds of blow dryers because that 's where i was raised i was raised in a beauty shop my kids were raised in a beauty shop and now my grandkids are raised in a beauty shop um i went back to the university i graduated and started uh was a hairdresser at 17. i went back to university raised my kids um and still doing hair full time but then now i want to fast forward here for a second i want to fast forward to four to when i was 40 um in 2001. i 'm i i trained in a group for a disaster relief team i was really struggling with my identity as a hairdresser i always thought that i should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hairdresser and that was always difficult for me and you know i i yearned for more and um but it so in 2001 i took i went to uh train with this disaster relief team and this was a team that was uh you so you could deploy out to the ring of fire so to speak anywhere in the world within 24 to 72 hours well because i 'm a hairdresser and i was working in my mom 's salon i knew i could uh get out of there fast i knew i could contact all my clients and boom i was gone so the thing is is what happened was 9 11 september 11. i graduated from my training in august and then 9 11 happened in the uh the new york uh the trade center uh was under attack and that was where i deployed out to i thought i was going to be sent to some volcano erupting somewhere in the world but no i i was in my own country and i got to um ground zero as fast as i could what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than doing hair and knowing how to hand out blankets or whatever through this training there was a whole group of us girls that wound up being on the same team and we all had something some sort of training in either massage therapy or physical therapy and so what we did is we did uh massage for the firefighters when they were in um coming on and off their shift this is hard this is really um it was quite traumatic it was we listened right we listened to them telling their stories of seeing their friends jumping from the building and and how so many of them had uh lost so many of their people in in the firefighting uh brigades and police officers they were traumatized and our job was not really massage therapy our job was to let them talk and to let them slowly just debrief and start uh they 'd seen too much and it was just really tough when i got home from uh two two and a half weeks in uh new york city i i i brought that home with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to go into the port-a-potty and i would just weep because i could just see their pain it was you could feel it it was in the air it was very very it was rewarding it was most rewarding and the most difficult thing i 'd ever done in my life when i got back to i 'm from michigan so when i got back to holland michigan where i 'm from i um didn 't know what to do with everything i 'd seen and heard so i i became obsessed with um finding out everything i could find out about afghanistan i had uh heard the word taliban for the first time when i was doing my training in august i knew that my team had done um a medical relief team there and had gone into afghanistan during the taliban time and so i knew that they were possibly thinking about doing another team into the country and i wanted i i knew that i wasn 't done with with my job so to speak i i watched everything i could on tv about afghanistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researched as much as i could and the one thing i knew is that i wanted to go to afghanistan i knew i wanted to uh when i saw the the video of the the woman um in in the back of the the car the truck being driven into the stadium and she basically had to get down on her knees and she was executed for a crime of basically being a woman i knew that i had to go there it was there was no way that i could live the rest of my life without without doing and being a part of something bigger so that 's exactly what i did i begged for a place to be on this team and as a hairdresser they 're thinking i don 't know this is a medical team i 'm not exactly uh certain what you 're gonna do on this team but i was certain i was certain that i could do something and so needless to say i um saved all my money and i got to be on this team and when i got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was doctors and there was dentists and there was nurses and everybody had some sort of medical background except for me i was a hairdresser so i did laundry um i like did things around the guest house but i shopped a lot because i was the only one i 'm not on the medical team but during one of the the expatriate gatherings um they were introducing our team because they wanted to tell other expatriates hey we 've got doctors and we 've got dentists if you need anything we 're here to help you um so whatever it is you need and so they were introducing everybody on the team and this is so-and-so and their doctor and this is so-and-so and she 's a nurse and he 's a physical therapist and you know this one 's an engineer and all all this sort of stuff and i 'm kind of sitting there and i 'm thinking feeling completely unqualified to even be in the room and then they said and this is debbie rodriguez and uh she 's a hairdresser surprisingly the room erupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it 's and they were like oh my god there 's a hairdresser in the country and i 'm thinking yeah after the meeting i just i felt like a rock star everybody was coming where are you at i haven 't been able to get my hair done i 've been here for like two years and haven 't had a haircut and so i 'm thinking well i 'm here i i kind of knew where i was i was always lost and i had a driver and i said well you know what let me um let me just give you a note on uh uh the address turn left here turn right here and you can find where i 'm staying and sure enough word got out that there was a hairdresser in the country and that was all it took i had sticky notes on my door from all the newscasters uh you know bbc abc cbn everybody was in afghanistan and it seemed everybody needed a haircut which it was so bizarre i had one woman come to me and she says oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have i i got bionic lice my girls and myself we got bionic lights going to uh a beauty shop she was a missionary in the country she says i drove the kyber pass 12 hour drive to get foils i 'm like wow that 's a pretty rough drive 12 hours on a pretty much non-existent road because i had taken that road myself and that 's a tough route to go for foils i 'm like so i started doing foils then i had one woman come to the house because we didn 't have cell phones right there was uh walkie-talkies or that basically was word of mouth or people just dropped by your guest house so this one woman came by and she said could you please give me a perm i 'm thinking yeah i don 't i brought my scissors i brought my comb i have a cape i don 't want perm rods i don 't have perm solution and she comes out with this bottle it was like one of those antique looking brown bottles and she says i buried this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i buried it along with my perm rods i have end papers i have perm rods please please please do my hair i 'm like absolutely so i set up shop and i was so busy uh the medical team was doing their thing i was doing my own disaster relief which was hair because you should have seen the hair unbelievable so that 's what i was doing and oh my god i was full of joy i loved what i 'm doing because truly i am most comfortable when i 'm doing hair and so then i was thinking what is it about why isn 't why can 't people get their hair done why can 't they just go and just get to get a haircut so i thought you know what i 'm gonna check this out i 'm gonna see if i can find any salons well what had happened is because salons became illegal they had all had to go underground it was illegal to have mirrors it was illegal to go get your makeup done it was illegal to wear white shoes fingernail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go underground so i 'm thinking okay so there was a few so i said to my driver i said find me a salon i want to go in there and see what 's going on so sure enough i went in and um i i was shocked when i went in it was like this little corridor almost like the size of a hallway and there was this broken mirror that was across the wall and you know it had that broken and distorted color there was a wooden plank underneath that and then in the very back there was his hook and you could see the burqas hanging on the hook and i saw this woman and she was trying to cut hair with scissors the size of hedge clippers it was cute they were just these huge scissors and i sat down and i said you know i told them through a translator who i was and i just i 'm i 'm i 'm a sister hairdresser i 'm i 'm i just came to see what 's going on and what possibly i could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be from this dark hole that you 've had to be in for all these years what can i do and so i 'm watching this young woman do a perm and she is literally using sticks about oh smaller than my pinky and i know that a lot of you may not have any idea what a perm rod the size of your pinky will look like just imagine fuzzy fuzzy hair and she was doing it without sticks and a rubber band and i 'm thinking wow you know i think i know what i can do i am going to come back to this country i 'm not going to come back with the medical team because i 'm clearly useless there but i 'm going to come back i 'm going to bring perm solution i 'm going to bring perm rods and scissors i 'm gonna bring stuff so that they have um they have they have supplies that 's what i 'm gonna do so i um went back to the guest house and um i shared with my team what i 'd experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of shook their head and they said why would you bring them supplies what you need to do is you need to you need to build a school i 'm like a school what do you mean a school they go you need to build a beauty school you need to teach the women the supplies are going to run out but if you teach them hairdressing do you teach them this skill and they 'll never leave them and i 'm thinking well i i don 't know like i 'm a hairdresser from michigan what do i need what do i know about teaching or putting a school in afghanistan i mean that 's a pretty big task well i know what a lot of people are thinking is that number one why would you uh want to open a beauty school and why would you want to teach hairdressing when everybody 's covered in a burka i 'm here to tell you that underneath those burqas are the most beautiful glamorous well quaffed women you 've ever seen i 'm talking makeup perfect everything they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women up in their homes for like seven to eight years and so they were they were just now rising from the ashes and i started to think about it and i thought you know what i can do this i can open up a salon because you know what being a hairdresser is like this amazing profession although i wasn 't respecting it as much as i did uh i do now but the one thing that these women can do is once they have this trait nobody can take it from them once they have this trade they 'll keep it for the rest of their life they 'll always be able to put food on the table i know this from being a hairdresser and so i thought you know what this is what i 'm gonna do i am gonna do this because these women were safe safer i 'll give you an example if you had taught them to sew right fantastic thing learning to sew but a man could also do this job so basically once they learned how to sew they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access and their job could be taken away from them so this is why um i then decided that i was going to start a beauty school in afghanistan and that is um what i did and so this is where the first book comes into play so i um this is the kabuti school this is the first book that um i wrote about basically my time in afghanistan and um it was i i felt like i had a window into a very cool place um we trained over 200 women i started a salon again my safe place is a salon so i started a salon i had the school and i was just around these amazing women just doing what i do in my comfort zone and then i needed coffee i needed coffee desperately i had been drinking coffee so this was like 2 000 um fours when i wrote the book but 2002 is when i went to afghanistan so in about 2006 um i decided that coffee was the next thing i am on my agenda i knew that i like uh gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's when i opened up the coffee shop and so again um it was such a an amazing place to be and that 's um this book the little coffee shop of kabul which is kind of based on um my experiences and i didn 't wanted to fiction um our non-fiction i 'm sorry i didn 't want to do non-fiction again i wanted to really just do um tell my story but in a fiction manner and use the inspiration of wonderful people that i 've met in afghanistan and so that was that was kind of um kind of fun i really love the coffee shop so then um in 2007 i had some security issues and i had to leave the country and so um that 's when i went back to the united states and a couple years later i moved to mexico and i 'm in mazatlan mexico a beautiful um little spa a little colonial city on this on the sea it 's stunning here and um i did what i do and i started a spa called tippy toes and um i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girls uh for hairdressing for um it 's called oasis rescue uh we teach them hairdressing scholarships for nails for massages for facials to learn how to do makeup and so i love that right so i found my own little home again and i met so many wonderful people here and that 's when i live on carnival street so this is when i wrote the book the little uh the house on carnival street which kind of takes you from the beauty school to here in mexico and so then uh after that let me see i 'm just going to do this quickly uh then i wrote the return to the little coffee shop of kabul uh which is um not a sequel it 's standalone but takes place in afghanistan and then in um uh the pacific north northwest like the seattle area and then the zanzibar wife which is uh zanzibar and oman and then island on the edge of the world which takes place in haiti this is where you 'll first meet uh b and charlie i love b and charlie they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history uh my history is out of the way um i now i want to talk to you about my new baby the moroccan daughter oh my god i love this book there 's something i don 't know magical about morocco right there 's something so it 's so full it 's so rich it 's it 's everything that makes my heart beat harder it 's everything that brings my senses to the world um i i i don 't know there 's i love it i love morocco um i love this book it 's it 's about secrets i love secrets because i 'm a hairdresser you know hairdressers we all love secrets that 's what we do i 'm i 'm like i feel like i 'm licensed for secrets because like i 'm a hairdresser and in my chair we get all of them and i love that and i love a book that 's full of secrets um it 's about secrets that people have been keeping for a long time it 's about forbidden love you know forbidden love i know there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh i don 't even know i think we 've all maybe have experienced forbidden love i have i have and something about forbidden love makes you want it more right uh not always good for you it 's not always the healthiest thing but it is spicy clashing of cultures morocco is has its one foot in uh in europe and has its other foot in africa and so you get these clashing of these cultures the old with the new the contemporary uh the forbidden the the traditional it 's all of this like coming boom it just clashes it truly does you can feel it like when you are in one of the cities you were in like this modern city and you step over into a medina and boom you were right there like 2 000 years back so the book brings you this this the drama really drama of clashing cultures but it 's all set it shows you the strength of family family is huge family is huge in in so many uh countries it 's especially huge in morocco and the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book takes place with the backdrop of morocco it takes place you experience the magic of fez the fez medina let me let me describe to you the medina or the so you there 's this arch right and it 's the blue the blue gate and it 's as when you walk into that under that blue gate like it 's almost electricity you can feel the energy of that city pulsating just bringing this amazing energy and the it 's loud it 's chaotic you 're being run over by donkeys there 's vendors everywhere the senses are completely overwhelmed absolutely overwhelmed from the the medina and the fez medina is like a spectacle on its own the fez medina is like 9 000 roads little roads i 'm not talking road a car can go on i 'm talking a path little pathways of with with uh houses or i should say doors on each side and shops and the donkey will come and you back yourself up against the wall and you can almost feel your feet like them grazing your feet because they 're gonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to meet charlene b again which is fantastic and so the one um the thing about b you may not know is b is about 70 and 76 ish and she 's blind and so um i i i wanted i met this woman or a young young woman i was in a training with um when i took my hypnosis classes and i was with this woman who was blind and she was uh kind of clairvoyant in a way but she could sense and and feel things around her that like were there but you couldn 't see it or you couldn 't feel it until after the fact and i watched her i spent a month with her and i thought you know what what a fantastic way uh she wasn 't missing anything she was feeling more she was seeing more really she was hearing more tasting more experiencing more than what i was and i could see everything she had this intuition that just came stronger because of her sight uh not being there so i really wanted to make a character be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b is a clairvoyant she 's a medium she can talk to dead people she 's quirky uh i want to be beat right like when i grow older i want to put a turban in my hair i want to wear big funky glasses big clunky jewelry if i could talk to dead people i would but i want to be b because she can say things that other people can 't say i i like having older people in my book because they 're unfiltered and b is completely unfiltered and fun but i 'll tell you what when um when i walk i 've been to fez before but uh when i i went on a research trip and when i uh walked into the medina with my two friends my two girlfriends that came with me i all of a sudden thought that i had made the biggest mistake of my writing career by dragging b to morocco there was no way in a million years that she could maneuver in the medina impossible she was it 's just it would be absolutely impossible first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were wide open i was tripping over the uneven pavement you were huffing it up a hill and down a hill there was steps it was it was like dodging land mines there was some and donkey poop right like it was i thought oh my goodness there 's what was i thinking well my girlfriend linda and eliza were with me and linda um i my normal research partner um ellen had a medical emergency with her family and was unable to make it and i i was in a panic i had rented this um giant riot because a lot of the story takes place in in in this huge palatial riyadh um of this family wealthy family in the middle of the medina in fez and i 'm thinking to myself are you kidding me i do not i 'm not a chicken right but i did not want to stay in this humongous riyadh by myself in the middle of the medina of in fez where you 're getting lost constantly i thought no way there is absolutely no way i literally put my sls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trip and both linda and uh and eliza said okay okay we 're in we 're in and eliza came in from um from london and my girlfriend linda she came in from um mazatlan we 're actually neighbors here and so linda was uh you know we had about a 30-minute walk from the time we got into the gate under the blue gate and going into where our our riad was we got somebody with a wheelbarrow you know pushing our our our uh suitcases and linda had just had surgery like six weeks prior on her knee so she was really struggling by the time we got into the riot her knee was swollen twice the size and i 'm thinking oh my god linda norbie are gonna make it in fez i was like oh my goodness you know we 're all worried that linda was doing damage to her knee and now i 'm thinking okay and now b if linda can 't make it how can b make it so my the my uh the uh manager of the riyadh he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got it we t i 'll take care of it for you and so the next thing i know he comes in with a handsome guy pushing a wheelchair we were howling like this is perfect the wheelchair number one and then we have the handsome guy so we 're thinking okay perfect this is going to be great and so you know linda she loads up into the wheelchair and i said you know what i think this is like i mean not that your knee is a blessing in disguise but the fact that now you can experience fez with your eyes closed i said i i know i need to know what bee is feeling what b is seen without her eyes open what she is hearing what she is smelling so bless linda 's heart she went uh she i don 't know how much of that she actually saw because i keep saying close your eyes close your eyes i want to know what you 're feeling what do you smell because there 's so much going on at all times right that um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction you 're hearing the vendor you 're you 're dodging donkey poop there 's a thousand cats everywhere um you 've got you know you know i 'm a shopper so you 've got like a little sparkly things oh there 's purses over there oh there 's lanterns over here like i 'm like on sensory overload just the shopping because like that 's my thing i love shopping and so uh but when your eyes are closed all of that 's gone you have your you can hear and so linda had a recorder she was ex you know going into detail what she heard like i can hear she would say i hear the sound of a plastic bottle like it 's being kicked all of a sudden i look and sure enough there is children playing soccer with a water bottle a plastic empty water bottle so i really think there was something about that moment that we 're able and you know i snuck a few times in the wheelchair myself which is really weird to be in in the medina in fez with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so but i i think that there was that uh and thank you linda for doing this for me um that means everything bring it up to a whole different level i 've been getting a lot of comments about really could really could sense the medina really could understand the flavors like the smells the sounds really came alive and i think that 's because we 're able to experience it literally experience fez with our eyes closed which like i 'm i 'm so thrilled and then the another amazing thing is you know like i always had dreamed about writing a book in uh in morocco that takes place in morocco but it 's not always that easy right you don 't always just get to write a book that takes place in morocco you have to have a story line you have to have all of that and so a friend of mine um called and she says you know what there 's somebody i really want you to talk to i really want you to meet she 's a moroccan american and she is amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character herself like she 's funny and she just can tell a story and i uh i i spent some time uh talking with her and then i flew to new york to meet her and it was so amazing she had um she had lived her father was literally the director of prison and she literally lived on the grounds of of a prison and so where the atrocities are taking place and she 's living this luxurious lifestyle on the compound of the prison while people are getting are disappearing in the prison like this was quite a few years ago this is when the political prisoners all this sort of really bad stuff was happening i 'm like you gotta be kidding me like that is like i could just feel my head weaving tails like that was i 'm like okay okay i i think this is it i think that like i can work with that and then so after like spending a weekend with her um telling me all these stories about the families and i you know said listen if if i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you be a consultant she 's like absolutely i 'm there and so then so i came back to mexico and uh i started you know doing more research about morocco and i found this town called emma shield and this town has this romeo and juliet story now i 'm going to read this to you because when i read this i i just like i was in in a small town high in the atlas mountains of morocco each harvest season brings a celebration born of trage of a tragic berber legend the ancient tale tells of two star cross lovers from different tribes who wish to marry but their families sworn enemies forbaded torn between their families wishes and their love for each other the pair became overwhelmed by grief forming two lakes with their overflowing tears eventually both lovers stepped into their respective lakes and drowned themselves legend has it that due to the mountains separating the two lakes their two souls remain apart even after their deaths leaving them doomed to yearn for each other for eternity the elders now responding to the sadness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a day on the anniversary of the lover 's death for young members of all tribes to gather and have the freedom to find a partner of their choice the imbecile marriage festival carries on to this day as a symbol of love peace and understanding well it was basically at that moment uh i knew i had to go to emma 's show and i was able with my girlfriends uh we went oh actually eliza she backed out of that part of it but linda and i we went um up the mountain to the high atlas and experienced something that is unbelievable in the marriage festival and what uh what i 'm doing right now um just to give people a little bit of a clue of what 's happening like what we saw as i 'm making these like 60 second little videos on posting them to instagram and facebook uh so uh if you want to see them there my instagram is uh dub d e b b underscore r o d uh and you can see the uh you can i 'm gonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a little bit of visual to go with while you 're reading the book so it was so cool the research trip this girlfriend 's research trip literally the ultimate the ultimate trip the ultimate girlfriend 's trip uh if it it was magical because you you don 't um you don 't do the tourist stuff right like i 'm looking for witches i 'm looking how we need to cast spells on people i 'm looking to see where we can do love potions um you know i 'm i 'm trying to find all that detail so uh when you read um the part about the hamam scene with b realize that was researched out i had never been to a hamam i had avoided going to hams or public bathing like all my life like that was my goal is to really not have to do public bathing and i knew that b was gonna have this moment in a bathhouse and there was no way and i 'm like okay girls we gotta do it and so it i 've never let we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are standing there the three of us butt naked being doused with water every five seconds our hide taken off our body scrubbed like i 've never been scrubbed before slippery slipping around on this marble slab like a wet fish and i mean talk about weird girlfriend moments we 're like thinking you know dab they 're like that you know we didn 't sign up for this i 'm like i 'm so sorry i 'm so sorry but i have to find out how all the hams work and so we had fun you know and so that was that was um that was wonderful and so the book just is this magical tale of amina and her secrets and her love as she 's trying to go from she 's a a moroccan-american woman who has a secret that she is coming back she married an american and she 's coming back to morocco to tell her family and like chaos happens and all all you you 've got to read the book i mean i don 't even want to tell you anymore because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fun and it 's about it 's got friendships and oh it 's it 's fantastic so okay i 've been blabbing on for about 50 minutes now so i am going to um i 'm going to uh answer some of these questions so uh this question 's from wendy kane wendy is also an aussie who is living here in mazatlan i was i was impressed that a lot of your interesting characters are a bit older well done yes um that was an intentional decision like i said earlier i really like the fact that um i think older characters can say things that other characters can 't um from karen kinney who uh karen hi i 'm so happy to see that you 're here um you uh what is most interesting food you 've eaten while doing research for a book okay so karen i can 't believe you asked that question that 's so funny um i am not uh i 'm not a big uh eating different foods sort of cow but i have eaten a lot of meat that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's uh i don 't know i 'm not i 'm not that adventure i 'm not eating like crickets i have eaten one uh and i 'm not eating like worms and stuff like that so basically i just like try all the really good foods um um oh did any of your all this is did any of your customers become characters in your books you know what that 's funny that you asked that my customers people inspire me their stories inspire me and um i i think sometimes maybe not there will be a story that a customer will tell me and i will then say um i 'll call them and say listen you know your story that you told me while i was doing your hair was really inspirational um i would like to maybe use a part of that in my next book everybody 's usually game but i 'll tell you there 's one um frederick in the book he 's at the very end lovely french man who uh owned a riad in marrakech eliza and i stayed as at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something and he would say oh debbie and eliza i don 't know if the women love me for me or for my riyadh and i can 't do it for jackson that 's my friend jackson and he had this gorgeous riyadh and he was loving he wanted a moroccan girlfriend really bad and i don 't know if they love me for me or for my riyadh and i would say frederick they love you for you leon i will love you for your rihanna so it was it was so he actually i said you know we spent time laughing and talking him telling us his like love stories so to speak i said you know you 're gonna wind up in the book right it 's a given and so frederick you 're in the book and i did text him and ask permission and he is in the book um okay question from linda uh i really enjoy how your books capture the local essence of the characters the island on the edge of the world i wonder how long did you spend in 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also spend a lot of time in morocco so in haiti uh [Music] i had work i was working with uh a woman who had spent 25 years in haiti and so once the book was planned out basically um the story was already there right i knew spending time with her and talking with her i knew the story i knew the storyline because i would uh i worked with her for probably maybe a year or something like that trying to get the nuances of things that could or couldn 't happen in haiti and then once i was in haiti we basically walked in the steps of the characters and so although i it was a couple weeks in haiti i i wish it had been longer um but i really uh utilized um serena who was like a complete haiti expert and literally 25 years of her life spending in and out of 80. so uh i was able to capture as much as i could in that time and then working with her um was able to get the nuances um that needed to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraclide spent i 've spent more time in morocco but again you need moroccans you need to have uh locos you need like for instance um in the in the uh end of the book there 's a wedding and i mean i needed to know what it was like for a hairdresser to do hair a moroccan wedding is out of this world and so um i i found a hairdresser there who was able to walk me through every moment that a hairdresser has from when they 're doing the hair in the salon to when they come in they 're doing the hair again at the wedding because there 's so many changes of costumes and then you know i worked with uh with uh people from the mountain region and uh they read the book and they consulted it 's so important to have these people um because they are the lifeline to getting it right without them i mean they are i owe everything to to the people who i worked with and so because you can never be in the country long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you you you utilize and work with the moroccans um from helen were you ever scared being in afghanistan in what time especially as you are educating and empowering women um you know what there was times that like yeah i was scared but most of the time i wasn 't actually uh the working with the women that never uh my security issues never were there uh from results of working with the women my security issues were um like there would be a suicide bombing happen or they pull up the building that was near your salon or um you know there there was riots that would happen that sort of stuff that 's when you feel nervous right um and then at the end there was uh my son was with me and there was um some security issues with him and myself and so we had to leave quickly so um but honestly i never really ran into i never really ran into security problems because i was educating the women i 'm really thankful for that uh josephine from africa hello from my students we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your favorite place to visit in africa we are from the congo zimbabwe zambia kenya tanzania burundi rwanda south africa and sudan well okay rwanda rates up at one of my favorite i spent uh a birthday up with the gorillas that was so

you 're researching a book i spent uh you know i did the normal safari stuff in um in kenya which you know was safari stuff which was just stunning and beautiful um but you know morocco you know there 's just a different flavor there 's different flavors and uh different areas of um of africa africa is so diverse and so big and i really do uh want to spend more time in africa let 's see i am

camels everything everything uh you could buy makeup you could buy your meat and have it grilled and these the young people were out in the by the thousands i mean there 's like 20 000 people there they were out in the thousands and they were circling they would make this round and they were you know give a little wink and a nod and you could tell you could see like i literally could see the two the boy and the girl because they basically have permission to look for each other look for their partner and this marriage restaurant it 's like three-day festival i know it 's pretty fast but you know who am i to say anything and so they would find uh who they thought might be their partner and they would um they used to have it where they would uh you know meet the beginning of day one and possibly get married on day three i think now with things changing a bit that often they may meet at the marriage you know i mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is kind of you can feel the love in the air people are looking for love and they 're they 're looking for each other because they 're given permission on this day that they can do that i loved it it was so much fun so it was dusty i mean seriously

your book yeah yeah we just sat here in the tropics so fantastic without further ado thank you thank you so much for that introduction um my name is admiral kenny and this is my first novel those hamilton sisters which was published by echo publishing just the end of march so it 's an april release just in time for mother 's day which was really exciting um i 'll tell you a little bit about myself well actually i 'll tell you about the book first um it 's a coming of age tale it 's women 's fiction it 's a story about three orphan sisters who 've returned in the 1950s to their mother 's their outcast mother 's birthplace so it 's a small town a fictional town called noah vale which is set just south of cairns um and the girls have come home to the care of their auntie so then we follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epic sweeping story it 's also a story of women overcoming and it 's the story most of all about sisterhood so i 'll tell you a bit about myself um first of all i 've been a cairns local since 1987. um i moved up here with my family when i was eight years old um i was born down in naruman new south wales so very different landscape and setting i was a farm girl i lived on a dairy farm for those first eight years of my life grandparents just over the hill and it was a rolling green dairy farm overlooking the sea and we didn 't have a television we had a little old farm house that my grandparents lived in and my grandfather had built my parents house no television i just had a room full of books so i read all the time while walking around the dairy farm just looking at the beautiful surroundings and it 's always been for me imagination and surroundings landscaper linked and just that love of reading i was an early reader um so i started my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire away tree magic far away tree with ian and blyton and i actually have a very distinct memory um my mum in later years when we lived down there was the flora so naroma is a small town it 's a fishing town um with dairy and lots of farms around and um my mum was the small town forest so she used to take us up to sydney to the flower markets and i remember sitting in the back of the car and i had the faraway tree on my lap or my inner blight and hardcover books and i just remember thinking this is it i have to be an author i have to have a book like this and i have to write books and i was 95 and it was just that was i wanted to be a mother always but i just knew i have to be an author no matter what i have to write a book so that 's been there for me throughout everything all through school i 'd be sitting there make believing that i was at university learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book instead of an english assignment and when we moved up to cairns so we left the dairy farm and came up to cairns and i just actually before we left my teacher said oh you 're going to cairns crocodiles everywhere there 's just crocodiles and i was this you know eight-year-old child just think oh my goodness you know that 's all i knew of cairns and then when we arrived here it was hot we got off the plane and it was that we thought oh so it 's the jet engine it 's just so hot we 'll get away from the plane and it won 't be so hot and that never stops it 's never stopped being so hot um and it was just walking into this i say it 's an enchanted place everything about it is otherworldly it 's the plants and the trees and the creatures and everything about this place is otherworldly and i as a child fell in love with it i just you know going from such a different place to coming up here and the wildness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really set the stage for me with my first novel um and with my writing that sense of trying to capture someone who 's arrived in a place that is so magnificent and so different and how that impacts every aspect of your lives you know it 's just a part it 's how you live is so influenced by the um the weather and the landscape so um when we first moved to kansas my parents went into tourism so i also had that experience of um my dad was a coach driver and he would my mom was working full time all the time and so on the weekend she put us on the coach for dad and he 'd go off to do a data and we 'd be sitting in the coach and we thought that was great because we were the coach driver 's children and my brother would be wearing the little coach driver mini uniform and we 'd travel all around up to the dane tree and down to paranalla park and up to the tablelands and i 've been sitting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad just giving all the commentary and he 'd be describing what we were seeing and he would be giving all these amazing stories and he just he loved nature books and he loved anything that gave him an insight into their local area so i always would be sitting there myself with my mind running off to imaginings and things i wanted to write while my dad 's voice would be there guiding me through the local area so i think that 's had a huge impact as well for me it 's storytelling is so entwined with the the landscape and where we live here um i wrote from very early age i was always scribbling always leaving notes and notebooks and stories around everywhere my first novel i started writing in high school and i finished that when i was in um university at james cook university i was doing teaching because i thought well if i become a teacher i 'll have lots of time to write obviously i 've grown up and learned that 's not the case um but i wrote my first novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishable novel the only person who 's ever read that novel to this day is my husband and then i went off to university of queensland and did journalism so i thought well if i can get skills um actual writing skills that will help me and i really actually secretly just wanted to do the creative writing course that they offered as part of the journalism degree so that got me one step closer to doing creative writing so i um really enjoyed my time down at university of queensland and being away from cairns only made me love the place more and when we did our creative writing course as part of the degree i remember writing my short story about up here about cyclones um and it 's i still have that short story in fact there is a description in my novel that 's still from that short story that i wrote at uni because i could never escape how much i loved it and we studied books that were set up in the north as part of literature courses at uni and i just felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i i should be able to talk about it to everyone so i just i love this place um when i came back to cairns i worked continue to work in tourism so i 've done everything from i started as a reservations clerk when i was 12 i did day tour hostessing i 've worked in operations and all the dispatching of coaches and so forth so i 've worked from a very young age that was through my family and through my uncles which was at dallander tours so um that 's just in my lifeblood really um and then i first fell pregnant in 2005 and had my first baby and that 's when this book was born too so we were living in freshwater at the time and we 'd be after work each day we 'd go to walk through the sugar cane fields there in fresh water and the sun would be setting with this just magnificent light that comes across the top of the cane and we 'd be walking through and that 's when this first um idea of this family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the story actually came to me first so the end was in the beginning i knew how the story would end um i knew the place that it would finish up i also saw the final scene um and then i proceeded to have another two children so i had three children in four years um and that was an all-consuming endeavor and then when my littlest um my then third child um was a newborn baby i was just sitting there one day holding against my chest and i opened up a hardcover journal and i just wrote out the first chapter of this book and um it flowed out of me i 'd had the ideas there but it just absolutely flowed out of me and that chapter remains pretty much unchanged to this day um as the first line is still the same so after that i thought well i know my story now um i had the idea of this beautiful red-headed heroine um named esther and she was a mother and she just seemed to come to me and say these are my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um from there the story was born and these characters just sprang to life and then for the next about seven years i would write the story whenever inspiration struck so in between i then had another child so i 've got four children and it would be you know around the children and i 'd have um miscarriages and pregnancy and anxiety i had postnatal anxiety so a lot of things happened and that 's definitely shaped this story as well that 's been part of the emotional richness i suppose to the story and some of the characters complexities um and i wrote for another seven years i got to about 2017 and it was ready to go out to beta readers so my first early readers my first reader is always my husband my book goes out to him first so um then i went to beta readers and i decided um well i 'll try the what they call the slush piles so they 're the um you send your manuscript away and to the publisher unrepresented um and just i guess try your luck you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of those and didn 't hear anything you didn 't get any feedback or anything and i thought well you know if it had any merit i 'm sure it 'd be picked up it 'll be published um and i felt quite despondent about that but i absolutely believe in this this story so much it 's got my whole heart in it so i thought i 'm going to self-publish my book um and i was approaching my 40th birthday and i thought well i want to be i made up my mind i was going to be published by my 20th birthday and then my 30th birthday and i 'd made up my mind i would publish by my 40th so i thought well i 'll self-publish and if my story has any merit if people love it then it will take off in its own way i just really wanted to put it out into the world no matter what i just wanted my book out there so um i started the process towards self-publishing so um the first step was getting an editor i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most polished it could be even if only 50 people read it i wanted it to be in the best shape it could be i 've done so much work on it reducing it down from a very large bloated manuscript because i would just write when inspiration struck and i really let the girls in my story take the lead and so the story itself had just got so large and i needed to cut it down really bring it down to a smaller shape so it wasn 't quite so epic it 's still epic but not quite so i think um and so i organized to have it edited by freelance editor i had to wait quite a few months because she 's an absolutely brilliant editor her name is alex navas and so i waited and in the meantime looking at covers and all those kind of things that i had to hand over to experts i can 't do any of those things and when my manuscript actually came back from my editor the whole picture had changed so where i thought well i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was actually a case of my editor suggesting that i could try traditional publishing and she was able to guide me there first of all with her excellent editing of my book and then guiding me towards looking at literary agents and i was introduced to sela anthony so she 's just the most wonderful woman very long legacy in the publishing industry here in australia i was able to send my manuscript off to sower and couldn 't believe it when she accepted it i just i was jumping up down banging my head on the ceiling it was just the most exciting moment for me um and then we worked together just making sure we were both happy with the book and then it went off um out to publishers so i was very very lucky to be picked up by echo publishing australia so they 're a fantastic little um publisher they 're actually come under bonnier uk um so i 've been very fortunate that i 've been published um end of march here and i 'll also be published in uk in august so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as australia um so working with the team at echo has just been brilliant i 've spent the pandemic year polishing up my manuscript again um we had my publisher um tegan morrison had some beautiful vision for the for the novel so we brought the novel to this state um together and i 'm just so proud of it really really proud of it so um it 's a story about three girls um you can see on the front they 've all got a shade of red hair so um that was really important to me because the mother esther is this fiery redhead young woman who 'd left the town under a cloud of shame 20 years earlier and her daughters when they arrive back they come in on a steam train on the platform in 1955 and they are all in some way a version of their mother and that 's reflected in we 've got sonnet who is the eldest and she 's now the guardian of the younger girls so sonnet has the fiery red hair of her mother she 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novel then we 've got the middle girl which is fable and she 's got a strawberry blonde hair and then the youngest who here on the cover is an older grown-up girl but when she arrives she 's only a little three-year-old orphan so the three daughters step down onto the platform and they 're going to have to settle into town but not knowing that there 's a huge scandal in the town involving their mother and it 's the reason she left and that 's something that 's going to hang over all their lives unbeknownst to them upon their arrival um and the town of noah vale itself is um based sorry the veil it 's a valley itself it 's based on where i live it 's based on all the parts that i love here in far north queensland so when you read the novel if you 're a long time local i think you 'll recognize a lot of things and i hope that will give you delight to see little things that oh i know where that house i 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um obviously it 's very fictionalized and it 's it 's only inspiration but i hope there 's a few little things i 've dropped in that you 'll recognize the names and you say oh okay she 's used that um i 've i 've set it south of cairns but it 's you know the where i grew up um i went to school at trinity bay high school and we lived out at red lynch and when it flooded we would actually be sent home from school on bus and we 'd all be piled into the bus like sardines and you 'd be like this on the way home to cross the bridge before it went over um so you know i 've had that experience growing up of the cyclone coming and the rushing home when it would start to flood too much and that 's what this little veil is like no avails like that um it 's in the name no avail it 's just bridges going under all the time so i set the novel in 1955. i grew up here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look at what the experience was like very similar in that the landscape hasn 't changed and the weather hadn 't changed too much but obviously different attitudes and a much different life so my two grandmothers were women in the 50s raising families my husband 's grandmothers were raising families in the 50s so that was wonderful to start from the place of what it was like for those strong women in my life and all the stories they would always tell me about raising children and all the um then so my my mother and my husband 's mother and um father-in-law and what it was like for them back in that era so um something that was very wonderful for me was that my grandparents and my husband um auntie um had all written down memories so i was able to draw on the inspiration of people who had lived through those times um i my husband 's family actually um his um grandmother enid which is a nice little thing she was actually on her library card member number one at the stratford library so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think that was 1959 it might have opened i 'm not quite sure um but yeah she was member number one and she was in the tennis club there i think she was instrumental in that opening and she was joined the cwa when the cwa hall opened there in about 1955 i believe so there was a lot of those aspects that were really special for me to include in the novel um from that era um and um so the novel itself um is you know it 's set in the 50s and i the story belongs in the 50s because of what the girls go through and the issues that they deal with when i was writing this novel however i started writing it 15 years ago and these were events that came from my imagination and the experiences that the girls led me led me through because i wasn 't a plotter i was very much led by the girls and their experiences but what 's actually turned out to be quite unusual is the fact that in the media right now there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're still dealing with as women in this current generation so i found that quite um quite remarkable really that a lot of the things that were issues for women and that my mother 's generation talked about and you know things that would be said in a half whisper and swept under the swept under the rug and just the sense that women had that he would get away with it and she didn 't and it feels like that 's still current today unfortunately um so my characters are dealing with it in a different setting but i 've tried to write a novel which is uplifting so this is a story about women overcoming then this is a story about women finishing their own story and telling their own story so with my novel i obviously had to fit it around children and so i have a laptop and i would go wherever i needed to to write um when the children were younger i 'd have a child strapped to my chest in a little baby sling and i 'd be riding standing up while bopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my laptop in my bike and go for a ride or i often came to the library so i actually have a really special really special memory to me of one day coming here to write and i was sitting down the back and it was a fabled chapter so that 's my beautiful middle daughter and she i i didn 't know what she was doing that day i really would let the girls lead a lot and i remember sitting down there and i just went i don 't know and i looked outside and i saw these magnificent fig trees and i just went oh okay i know and it almost came fully formed into my mind the scene and so i stayed as long as i could before having to go and get my youngest then child from daycare and it just seemed to flow out of me so i actually have a photo on my instagram account from that day where i went and took a photo of myself at the stained glass with a beautiful ulysses butterfly and so forth and raved about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what it felt like to have a bit of time to myself because my children were they weren 't in daycare a lot i did most of the caring myself so that was really special to me to whenever i read that chapter i actually then come back to this to the library so there 's something about when you listen to an audio book and you when you think of it later you remember where you were when you read a certain part of the story and my novel for me when i ever think of a part of the novel i can remember where i was a lot of the time when i was writing it and often that was out somewhere where i was looking at the very thing that was inspiring me and so that 's something that 's really special about living and writing in the area in which you live is that it 's you know it 's like that i can just think to where i was at that time um i kind of run a little bit out of steam now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely why the redhead so i my favorite favorite book when i was growing up was anne of green gables and so redhead heroines i always knew i had to write a redhead heroin when i was growing up i was a little blonde girl and i just wanted to have red or auburn hair that 's all i wanted all my life and my mom had auburn hair so i wanted red or auburn hair um and i just love the idea of three feisty redhead girls i really loved that um and the anna green gables book was first given to me when i was a girl by my nana and from the little farm house she had these falling down kind of shelves and she handed me the book and was a yellow cover i 'm obsessed with the color yellow and i just fell in love with it read the whole series within a couple of months and um that 's had a lasting impact on me because ellen montgomery is a writer who loves the she just captures landscape and surroundings so beautifully and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling in her heroines that just that love of nature and that 's something that resonates with me i just my heart feels like a physical ache when i look at things that i love and then i just want to go and write i 'll take a photo just so i feel like i can capture it but then i just want to go and write and that 's um that 's how i am as a writer i i feel that the beauty that i want to show in my own um writing um and actually what 's really interesting with um ellen montgomery when she writes and green gables she 's a writer as well she 's an aspiring writer and her first published piece of work is actually a short story and it 's called avril 's atonement spell a v e r i l like my name so the first time i ever discovered that i just wept as a little girl because she wrote about me her first heroine was me so yeah does anyone else have any questions yeah just i get do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships of the sisters within the book um i don 't know maybe you 've got daughters or how did you get perspective of those relationships so i do have a sister i come from a family of three girls oh do you okay oh wonderful yeah so i have a sister um i have one sister and i have one brother um he actually jokes that um the joke 's on him because i made mine three sisters instead so there 's three in my family um my mom has sisters and i i drew on the relationships in as inspiration but these are their own girls they took on their own life um and i just feel as women you know it 's something that you it 's it 's life isn 't it it 's you know such a part of um life really i i don 't know it 's they they 're their own characters and they 're their own relationships but just drawing on you know those relationships with women in my life and yeah my mum and her sisters yeah it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in happy endings that 's not spoiling the ending no it is a happy ending yeah very much so now i wanted it to be what they call up lit or um you know like uplifting i i don 't like a sad and i also don 't like too much of an ambiguous ending as well i have had people say to me um or will you write a sequel because when the story ends obviously we start with plum and she 's a little three-year-old when we arrive in no avail and so when we end she 's just on that cusp of womanhoods where we don 't get to see the rest of her story but i did start writing a sequel um to the novel i probably wrote about 50 000 words and then i felt i 'm not there yet with that character and i didn 't feel like she was speaking to me very strongly i don 't like to feel like i 'm moving dolls around in the story i really need the the characters to to feel them i have to i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i write and i have to feel like i 'm just typing and they 're acting they 're they 're working and it just seems to flow out of me so um and i wasn 't quite there yet with plum she 's still a little bit feels um like i 'm moving her around and trying to tell her what to do with her life so i wasn 't quite ready for that um but it it does have a happy ending and it does have a satisfying ending that 's something that i hope people have been yeah they 've been saying to me that they feel very satisfied but it does leave you with that feeling i miss that family i 'd like to hear more of what happened to the family yeah yeah um how did you deal with having somebody cut large chunks when they were editing well with the editing it 's always ultimately up to me so when i first sent it away to my freelance editor before submission um i was advised i think it was about 18 000 words i had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with plum so the story was just way too bloated and she was a lot younger and the story itself most of my beta readers wanted to stay with the older girls as they were growing up and the the younger daughter didn 't interest them as much so it made sense to take it out and um i 'm not precious i don 't you know if people say oh it 'll be better without this there 's that initial feeling like oh but i really like that but then it doesn 't worry me at all to take it out so i actually find it quite addictive um editing i love the editing it 's a different state completely i 'll um my brain seems to flip over to some other state when i 'm in the editing process and i 'm much more analytical and um i can 't really do editing and writing at the same time i 'll need like a day between them before i can um switch between tasks um but i love it even um when i 'm i have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix something it 's just a really gratifying feeling i guess for some people the way housework might be not for me i don 't like to clean but um yeah i just i love polishing it up and every time i make any change to the book i just feel like oh that made it so much better i really yeah it 's a great feeling how did you find these beta readers because you weren 't engaged with a yourself self-publishing at that time so um i 'm because i 've been so busy with children um at home i haven 't really been a part of any writers groups or anything but that 's something that 's hugely valuable to writers is being part of writer 's group because you 'll get that peer critique and you can play ideas off people and so forth for me i 'm the kind of person when i was at school i didn 't even like to hang in a first draft i just wanted to do it all myself and then hand it in at the end whereas my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher will help them with it but um i i 've never been like that so i hold my cards close to my chest i guess and i felt like it was a very personal thing i didn 't want to feel like anyone else would ever read it to start with because i think that enables gives you a freedom to write and just express yourself with beta readers i actually chose my own um through people who i had followed largely on social media so people who i saw daily and they would post the books that they read and we were good friends but i would see pictures of the books that they were reading and i could look at their reading taste and think well that 's someone who 's got a very wide and varied diet of books and i chose people who i felt would give me honest feedback because i like to have my ego stroked but it 's not good for a writer you need someone who can be really honest and say this didn 't work or that didn 't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers whether in a writing group or for me my beta readers was that you get an overall picture of the book so you get the same feedback that i was getting from everyone was something that was coming through all the time and so i go okay well if everyone 's telling me that then that 's something i need to look at and it just gives you um you know a difference you know if i hand it to my mom she loves everything i write and she thinks everything i love is beautiful so thanks mom and um i handled my husband he sits down with a red pen and goes through it very you know he 's he 's a structural engineer so it 's he 's got a different way of looking at things but the beta readers it was great to have people who thought very highly of me and who thought highly of my writing but could also um be very honest um and you don 't want people that are going to make you feel um that feel bad about yourself but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to ask you about your book that wasn 't published so what 's what made that unpublishable oh the one when i was 19 that i was 19. um no well i you know there 's there 's a kernel of truth in that novel i i say there 's like a beating heart to every novel and there 's there 's a truth in that novel that will be a future novel but i 'm still um waiting for you know i feel like i 've come of age now and i could actually write that story well but when i wrote it i was writing it as a 19 year old and you know every 19 i was living at home still at that point and going to university here and you know that 's a very entitled kind of age really you know my everything was provided for me by my family and i was going to university and i hadn 't had all those lovely hard knocks or was about to go through all those things but um so i feel like i could write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know vain really i guess those novels at that age i was i 'm a prolific journal writer so i it was always written in first person everything i wrote and that novel 's in first person and this is not and um i feel that as i 've grown up it 's i 'm able to embody the experience of others much better because of the empathy you develop through being a mother and just through life and through sadness and awful things we go through but that first novel was written more like a diary it was i i um and that novel um yeah the truth is in it um and it will be a future novel but it 's it 's not publishable there 's a nice little turns of phrase in there so you write a day i try to i do a thing called morning pages i don 't know if you 've heard of that by julia cameron it 's her idea um she says you should wake up in the morning it 's a great exercise both spiritually and creatively you hop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and you write three pages and whatever comes out you just write i find that quite a spiritual practice because you 're just writing there 's no you 're not um making it look pretty it 's not for anyone to read hopefully it 's just whatever 's in your mind for the day and i 've resolved a lot of issues that way a lot of things that were really worrying me particularly when you start putting yourself out there as an author and you 're putting your writing out there and your stories out there you know you can have a lot of hang-ups about things you could you know be precious about stuff but i found just writing out feelings then i don 't need to bother my family as much talking about everything so um yeah i i do keep a journal but it 's i call it morning pages now so it 's not so much yesterday i went and i did it it 's very self-reflective um and it 's also sometimes just about building myself up so if i go away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next morning and kind of let it go i also get a lot of ideas for my novel that way too something that 's completely unconnected so i find it 's a creativity is a process of flow and so if i 'm if i 'm writing about something else an idea will come into my head that 's completely unrelated like there was a program running in the background and it 's just sparked and so then i 'll scribble that down and i have kept a journal throughout the entire um creation of this novel so i can actually look back and see all those big moments in the book there 's a parallel in my journals which is really quite special how did you know when okay we 're going to publish now i 'm done i 'm dusted it 's good to go out um i guess the answer to that is that it wasn 't ready when i thought it was ready to go to self-publishing um i thought that it was the best i could get it i 'm also someone that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i had to do the final read-through of the novel at the start of this year before it went to print i was almost in a state of panic because i thought well this is it like this is the last time i can touch it um and that was quite daunting to think oh i can 't i 've ever fix anything again um but it 's i think you could always improve a novel and i believe that if i look back in 10 years time there are things that i probably would change about the novel and i 'm sure there 's novelists today who 've been writing for many decades who would look back and and really regret things they 've actually written because times change attitudes change things change um but the way the novel is now i didn 't think i would feel so complete but i feel just so proud of it the way it is so that 's i guess the best sign and when you have an amazing editor you know the the feedback that you get through the editing process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer it 's me working with someone who 's more skilled than i am at editing so that 's a working process hello everyone this came it 's a great achievement so thank you yeah very good um we 've got cam 's books here for anyone that would like to purchase um a book and i 'm sure admiral would be more than too keen to sign it so thank you,"(-16.9203476, 145.7709529)"

going to do that thank you very much for your warm welcome i appreciate it um yes although this book came out uh last year we of course because of the pandemic we weren 't able to do any face to face uh talking about it with people and we had to do it all virtually so although i 've been using zoom a lot to talk to people about it it 's really nice to have an actual group of people in front of me to talk to about this um one thing i should say about the title the way i use the word country is not only in the sense of yes this is this is our australian country but also in the indigenous sense of country in that we have a spiritual affiliation um with the place in which we are and and we have a recognition of this place as being part of us and this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in books um and how we talk about that relationship how we review that relationship amongst us and i think we 've we 've already expressed the acknowledgment of countries so thank you now um and these were just some of the books i didn 't know whether we 'd actually have be able to have them here today but we can and these are just some of the books that i 've worked on and i 'll just talk about them really briefly this is the windsor hotel in melbourne and really this is a biography of a hotel um which is very interesting to do because it 's all about people anyway if you didn 't have people you wouldn 't have the hotel that 's what it 's all about it 's there for the people so it was really interesting being able to do this project we did this a number of years ago to celebrate the anniversary of the hotel and um it 's restoration and and opening to the public many years ago and and um so it was a great a really great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not able not only just able to talk to people but i was able to talk to a lot of the previous staff that worked in the hotel and many of them had really long associations with the hotel that went back a really long way all the way back to when they were chopping firewood for boilers and you had to get out there and clean the silverware by hand and all that sort of thing so it was it was a great chance to look at it the clark gable one came along after this one actually i was talking to another author who had just written a biography of marilyn monroe and he said look i was working about on this biography about marilyn monroe the last movie that she completed was a movie called the misfits in which she starred with clark gable and that was his last movie as well and he said i was able to find virtually nothing in print clark gable he said there was a couple of anecdotal biographies written not long after he died he said but after that nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no research book about him he said you should do one and i said yeah right i 'm gonna set off to do a hollywood biography right but that 's what happened and and not only one but two because we had enough material left over from the first one in terms of photographs the first one i really had to concentrate on the text more than the photographs and um and and the publisher came along to me later and said well look you really should make use of all those photographs that you 've got there um some of which hadn 't been seen a lot before and we 'll put them in another book so we did that so the two really go together as a result of that one one of the photographs that i used and this is often an example of how you do how books come along by the way is they quite often work in a chain you start off with one and then someone else sees at that one and says oh i could tell you a story about that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case i happen to come across a photograph of this lady talking to clark gable at a racecourse and i tracked down who the lady was and it was this lady mother crawford cantorini and at that time she 'd become a racehorse trainer but before that she 'd been a racehorse trainer in the sense of training them to work in movies and she had in fact back in the 50s been one of the very very few stunt women who were working for hollywood she was the one who fell out of buggies and fell off horses and fell out of trees you know [Music] all that stuff the stars didn 't want to do people like martha did and and we were able to use this great photograph on the front here um she 's actually coming off this horse the horse is doing a fall the horse is going over as they 're trained to do and she 's actually leaving the saddle so that she can hit the ground on her feet and and not be crushed by the horse when it goes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fascinating project but by then i thought i really should start moving sideways out of movies a bit and get into something else and we 'd been sitting around a group of friends and i um in melbourne used to sit around have coffee and we always used to say you know there 's got to be a book that in the clever things that australians have done which they have done i 've done a lot of very clever stuff and um we thought well there 's been books done about australians who 've invented things in australia but there 's a group of australians who are the first to do things in the world ever and i thought surely someone must have written that book by now but no they hadn 't and this is the thing that publishers always love to hear you mean no one 's written this yes i 'm going to be the first one so we went away and did that one um there 's 30 29 stories about people and one about a ship which was the empress of australia which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in the world um the other 29 people were the first people to achieve various things so we had explorers people who sailed around the world people who invented things all kinds of fascinating stuff in there so there 's quite a range of achievements it 's not just all about invention it 's really about human achievement and celebrating australian achievement that we are indeed really significant as achievers and you know we 've got this whole batch of firsts up there that are the first in the world and lo and behold as a result of that one i came across jesse miller 's story no one had heard about jessie miller much but she was actually the first woman to travel in an aircraft from england to australia and she did it as a co-pilot which is why she didn 't in her days she got a lot of cred for it but now the cred tends to go to the first woman who flew solo all the way but not the first woman who actually did it in a plane and and jesse miller did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was in fact the first person to pilot an aircraft across bastrate first woman sorry to fight pilot an aircraft across best straight and into tasmania she was the first woman she at one time she held the speed record uh across the united states both ways [Music] east west west west um she held a number of records in the states she was the first woman to fly from the east coast of america to cuba for example so she was really interesting person and her life was quite fascinating she got tangled up in a fascinating murder mystery um and uh that that was uh another whole chapter in her life again so on to the next on to ours cyclone country came about because when when i came up here to live this was really the first time that i 've lived in a cyclone zone i 've lived in with tornadoes i 've lived with hurricanes i 've lived with typhoons this was the first time i 'd lived with actual cyclones on land and so i was quite fascinated with the way people approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way people integrated it into their lives in fact and just you know laid back and said it 's going to be right we 'll just hold a party and just another wind you know it doesn 't matter and so that was yeah one of the things i was greatly intrigued about and also that we um incorporated into our life as a season other people have four seasons we have another one this is a cyclone season so i was intrigued by that as well so i decided to go look at how we talked about it how would how we lived with it and because you know i 'm fascinated with books how we approach that in terms of our books the things that we write the things that we read and this is all about the relationship between our place our weather our stories and us it 's about the book is about our search for the words through which we can find meaning amid the chaos amid the trauma and the devastation that 's wrought by extreme weather events and these weather events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can entirely disrupt our what we thought was a nice relationship that we had with mother nature out there we have this really comfortable relationship with our world and the cyclone comes along and destroys destroys the whole concept so how do we deal with that so these words and stories are important they form a cultural language by which we maintain the relationships in these dire circumstances with our place and our community and how they help us cope so i was surprised to find when i started work on this that this would be the first study of its kind in australia no one else had looked at that particular relationship between our extreme weather in the form of cyclones and and us and so i look at the function of the words the story in the literature in rebuilding our cultural relationships after nature catastrophes using an example using as an example the literature of the australian state in queensland now i do bring in other things i bring in broader context than just here but i use queensland as the primary example of of how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know beautiful one day cyclonic the next and if we want to live here we 've got to cope with that so why do it why write the book about queensland cyclones in books as i said no one else had done it much to my surprise and i by this time i had a personal association with it i 'm a cyclone survivor many of you are so we 're aware that cyclones can be traumatic significant life-changing events and we have the literary association we attempt to cope with what 's happened to us we attempt to cope with these disrupting events in a number of ways and one of these ways is by telling and writing stories about them i was interested to find out that for example down in innisfail after they 'd come out the other side of cyclone larry what did they do they all sit down and produce the local book about it the school kids wrote poetry the mothers got together and talked about having the rules blown off their houses you know there are all these personal accounts in this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cardwell came into it and and people from all that local area talked about it and what happened after cyclone yasi the same thing local community sat down and wrote books together about it you know and that 's their way of dealing with it that 's their way of coping with it as a community and and talking about this hugely destructive disruptive events that 's happened to them they sit down and write about it and it and it 's their focal point and we also have an international association because i was interested to find out as i went in through this project that queensland is where the naming of cyclonic storms all started before that we just used to name it about when it happened you know was was saint swithens day hurricane you know or it was the hurricane of 1566 you know we named it after the date or the saints day but we didn 't have a system and so it was in queensland that that system started and i 'll come back to that in a couple of minutes let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't realize it stacks up like quite like this um as we know the tropical cyclones are endemic to our north queensland coast because we 're part of the global tropical region you know we get them whether we like them or not they come along because we 're here since 1858 over 200 cyclones have impacted queensland 53 of which actually came within 100 kilometer radius of cairns that starts to stack up after a while we don 't fortunately suffer from very many that have actually hit cairns head-on but we 've had 53 of them come within 100k radius which is near enough most major towns and cities along the north queensland coast have been impacted one way or other by cyclones some of them have been severely damaged some of them not so much and some of them more than once cardwell for example has just kept an innisfail keep getting hit again and again and it gets a bit risky living down there i think and a cyclone was in fact the worst australian nature disaster in terms of loss of life back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which struck princess charlotte bay up there in cape york and unfortunately most of the torres strait pearling fleet was sheltering there at the time and got wiped out and somewhere in the region of about 350 to 400 people probably died in that um unfortunately because most of the people involved were either of mixed race or indigenous people or torres strait islanders they didn 't keep a very detailed record of actually how many people died besides which the cyclone was so severe it was equivalent to a cat5 cyclone and and it was so severe um it was hard to find all the survivors from it or all the people who all the casualties from it so it 's an estimate so tropical cyclones then are an integral aspect of the history the culture and the literature of north queensland so in the light of our current interest and our relationships with climate weather and place and this is a relationship that we 're becoming more and more interested in every day we 're coming great having a greater awareness of our relationship with the climate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us so i thought these three questions were really the basis on which i went ahead with the book what can literary cyclones tell us about our relationships with our culture our place our weather and our people what does the story storm tell us about personal experience and resilience in the face of trauma and what can the literary weather catastrophe reveal about and to us as individuals and as a community now i thought we 'd start back with a hurricane for a minute because this is really where our knowledge of cyclonic storms started way back with tano the indigenous people of the caribbean who had a legend about atabay who first created the earth the sky and celestial bodies she had two sons when yukiju one of the sons created the sun the moon the plants and the animals the other son huracan became jealous and tore it all up with a powerful wind becoming the god of destruction and that name has stayed with us as a hurricane and you 'll notice that 's the original tano symbol and little sculptural pieces they used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any contact with europeans at all this indigenous people had a concept of a cyclonic storm you can see clearly one arm is going one way one arm is going the other and you 've got the eye in the middle and they had that concept way before we did and this has come through to us in a modern symbol like this you can still see that same symbol coming through now we didn 't catch up with them until the mid 19th century when we started to become aware that cyclonic storms were unlike other storms that approached us on a weather front and hit us head-on cyclonic storms traveled on a path spinning as they went and they traveled a pathway and on either side of the equator they spun in different directions the word cyclone came to us in 1848 through an englishman henry storms pittington who was president of the calcutta marine courts of inquiry which is significant because in other words he was exposed to indian ocean storms so he 's exposed to the storms through the cyclonic storms through the indian ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for circle as in the encircling coil of the snake that 's how we got the word cyclone so he he borrowed that idea from the coiling curling of the snake and he published the name in his sailor 's horn book for the law of storms which was like the bible for captains at sea and that 's a copy of the book and in that book he had these interesting little transparent sheets which in those days were were very thin sheets of horn and so they were waterproof and they were transparent you could see through them with that with the with the cyclone pattern on it and what they would do would they would overlay that on a navigation chart and they would be able to see how to get how to sail out of the storm not not to go into it but to sail out around the edge of it in other words using this and the directions that he had in the book as long as you remembered which side of the equator you found were on so he came up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generic term we 've got more specific with our use of cyclone but his idea was that cyclone was going to be the name for all rotating storms and that something like a hurricane or a typhoon would be a subset of a cyclone now naming storms this is the man responsible mr rag a clement rag known by the nickname red rag in his day because of his red hair um he was the director of the chief weather bureau in brisbane from 1887 to 1903 a very literary man very fluent very dramatic writing style if you get a chance to go into trove and look up any of his forecasts they used to be marvelous pieces of prose they weren 't just a weather forecast an entire literary dramatic production about the weather and quite amazing and um he became the first australian national published weather forecaster because the papers love this and they picked up his forecast every day and it would work its way around australia in the days before we had an actual national weather forecaster as he went along he started to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one all the way from mount wellington in tasmania all the way up to thursday island and all the way out to new caledonia and they all reported back to the weather bureau and so he started to build up this incredibly for those days um accurate picture of what the weather was like coming towards us and no one had had that before and so he had all this information at his disposal and so it quickly became apparent that just calling these weather formations you know the west cyclone or the north cycle or something like that wasn 't going to work he had to have a system and so the first system he came up with was the greek alphabet being an educated man that he was and so cyclone beta was actually our first recorded named storm according to a system in 1894 and that 's the first time anyone had tried that and to quickly extend the story um otherwise there 's a whole nother talk just on naming storms and i won 't do that um when he left in 1906 when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they didn 't keep using it fortunately the senior weather person in england was intrigued by this and wrote it into a book he was writing about weather forecasting right up 1940 or so a chap with the name of george rippy stewart was in was researching his the novel that he wanted to write about a storm and he came across this reference in this english book to this weird australian has come up with a system of naming storms and he said oh that 'll work for my book because he really wanted the storm to be a central character in his book and he thought oh the best way to do that is to have a name for the storm and even better the really way to get attention would be to give it a woman 's name and he came up with the name mariah [Music] and yes a few years later lerner and lo read his book wrote the musical painted work painter wagon and in that is they call the wind mariah so you can trace that all the way back to an australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after that away we went now of course in the mid-1970s women rose up and said wait a minute how come we 're the four guys for storms always being named after women okay how come how come it all gets named after us all the time a woman a woman 's lady in the state suggested instead of hurricanes we should have hemokenes but australia once again being the innovators that we were took this discussion right on board and said you know she 's got a point and so not only did we become the first country in the world to start naming storms we became the first country in the world to degenerize storms and i think it was around 1975 we came up with equal gender naming storms at least alternate alternate naming male and female storms on our list and the americans didn 't come along until a couple of years after that so we 're innovators he goes right back to that book i wrote previously about great australian world first that 's one right there we came up with that innovation now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little about wine okay good wine and cheese has what we call tewar in other words we a really good wine connoisseur can have a taste of that red and say oh that comes from this particular area of france and if they 're really on board they 'll say it comes from that particular hillside on that particular road and they can nail it right down to where that wine came from in the sense of we can taste where the grapes grew because the quality of the soil and the quality of the climate and the quality of that geography of that area got into the grapes and into the fruit and thus into the wine okay so they talk about in the same cheese with the cows you can tell where those cows came from okay we talk about tara and so we can talk about the land where the literature has been created and developed nourishes it and imparts unique qualities to it so we can think of our literature having to in the same sense we can tell where our literature comes from so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's talking about that sense of country that sense of the relationship we have between us and and our country our land our area so the cyclone reveals to people they are part of the inevitable and uncontrollable cycle of death and birth destruction and renewal it reminds us of that reminds us of our mortality if you like to think about it that way and so tropical cyclones are an essential part of the north queensland tour to live in this landscape one must accept them as part of not just the literal landscape but also the imaginative personal and literary landscapes okay all come into us so when we talk about landscape it 's not just the view that we 're looking at we 're thinking about the imaginative landscape the personal landscape and the literary landscape but all being part of that tour we don 't often think about maybe that until a couple of decades ago it was very very difficult for someone to actually imagine a cyclone so we 're really used to it now we look at that picture over there and say oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of this big swirling beast that comes down on us and and this is what the cyclone is but that 's courtesy of satellite photography and before that high altitude area or photography and that 's only the last few decades before that people never had that picture of what the cyclone actually looked like they just saw it coming towards them really the picture that stayed in most people 's mind about the cyclone was the red flag before long distance forecasting or before people could notify you in a hurry about things this is how you knew when a cyclone was coming when the post office raised the red flag people used to talk about the post office in cairns raising the red flag and they knew that the cyclone was coming down on them and in cardwell and in innisfail and all our coastal towns down there they had one of these that went up above the post office and everyone said ah it 's we 're we 're on we 're on warning we 're on warning cyclone 's about to come down on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was more like this so you can think of our pictures changed the way we think about them in our mind has changed and so writing about the cyclone also helps us imagine it the cyclone also helps us imagine how the impact that it has on people now these are the group of books that i looked at in writing my book i looked at a group of books and these are the main ones i should say i looked at i looked at a lot but i thought these ones particularly encapsulated what we 're after vance palmer 's novel cyclone is the earliest one it was written just after the war after world war ii but he actually started it before world war ii he in 1932 he and his wife uh lived on green island just off cairns there lived there for most of a year and uh and then wrote a lot a whole lot of um very interesting uh quite fascinating articles about nature and about the natural environment up here and out on the reef they made a lot of friends in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the the boats that traveled from cairns to green island and back and they went on quite a few excursions with him became quite friendly with him and they said oh we 'll come back 1934 we 'll come back in a couple of years time and we 'll you know we 'll do it all over again well i 'll come back with a whole group of people this time um you know we 'll have a have a big excursion up and down the reef but unfortunately 1934 along came a big cyclone and and severely damaged cairns and unfortunately a few people lost their lives including the ship 's captain that he knew and he was really affected by this and that 's why um it took him a long time to write the book because he had to get over his really close personal association with these people in this place that had been hit really badly by the cyclone and he wrote a couple of articles and gradually developed those articles into the book that he published in 1947 so it 's a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what even though he doesn 't call it cairns it 's really what cairns it is cairns and what cairns was like in those but at that particular time and he really nails down that that picture of what local environment and local life was like right about ben and the impact that destructive storms had on people 's lives and how they coped with it how they endured theaters book a boatload of home folk is about a group of people stranded on an island uh their cyclone bears down on the tropical island and the the ship can 't get away and they 're all stuck there while the cyclone rages around them so it 's great one of those little closed room stories as we call them or or elevator stories sometimes as they 're known when you 've got a group of people stuck in a very small room and they can 't get out what 's going to happen you know and this is so you have that whole claustrophobic feeling the storm raging out there they can 't get away they 're at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm has is reflected in the people the bit of raging going on amongst the people you know and they 're at each other yeah so you get get that reflection of of the what 's going on with the group of people the group dynamic in in the dynamic of the storm as well i have the storm patrick white 's eye of the storm ashley and white were actually quite good friends they had this lapsed catholic thing going between them um and so you can see quite a lot of catholic ritual comes out in um in both in their writing in the structure of some of what they write um white was interested in the cyclone being patrick white from a more spiritual point of view his novel is about an elderly woman by the name of elizabeth hunter who a little earlier than when we 're reading about her in the novel was stranded also stranded on an island off the coast of queensland by a cyclone and she had to take shelter and she came out from a shelter right in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has this very spiritual experience of being in this very still place with the cyclone raging around out here somewhere in this still place in the middle and lo and behold along come these seven swans it happens to everybody really along come these seven swans and she has this experience of feeding the swans um from this old bread that 's lying around and forever afterwards she 's that experience stays with her and gives her that impression that she hasn 't lived the best kind of life that she could that she could improve it she needs to improve her life and and that eye of the cyclone kind of becomes the spiritual eye watching her for the rest of her life until she dies and she 's constant she 's aiming to return to that same spiritual experience at a moment of death and and be accepted um into the afterlife if you want to think of it like that um and so it 's a very interesting spiritual look at it which is which is why i looked at that book each of these books looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wright 's carpenteria is just simply the most wonderful book if you haven 't had a chance to read this book do um it 's just the most wonderful book as much because of the way the story is told as because of what 's in it um she set out to write an epic if you like to have a try out writing a homeric epic ulysses choice something like that an epic in indigenous way about indigenous people and their interaction with with european people and they 're in both those people 's interaction with their land with their country and and with the weather with the cyclones and it 's truly the most marvelous book you you really have to read it a couple of times because we 're not used to the way indigenous people tell the story they tell it as as european folk we 're used to stories being told in straight chronological lines we have a beginning an end and a sequence and indigenous people don 't have that at all in fact their story is very much their story structure is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's layered it goes up and down so you can start the story here and go down here and then come back up here and you 're still in the same story so it has that spiraling quality to it i always tell people look if you want to as training for reading carpenteria watch the movie ten canoes which is david gilbert 's ten canoes which is about indigenous it 's an indigenous story about indigenous people out hunting and it has that they start here but then the story goes to here and then the story goes to here and you know and then back to here so it 's it has that spirally quality about it and that 'll get used to the way that 's told and i think i 've read this book probably half a dozen times now and and i see something different in it every time i come back to it i go ah never saw that before and you know it 's just the most marvelous thing and i i fortunately have had the chance to uh to talk to alexis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down and have a discussion um she was uh i was very very fortunate in fact that she was willing to have a read of the chapter that i wrote because i was really nervous i must really say the right thing about this you know i was very happy that she was glad to sit down and read it and um and she said wonderful things about it so it was i was very pleased but she 's fascinating person to talk to she 's very quiet she 's she 's very quiet to talk to um and but fascinating to talk to none the same and the book is bracketed by two cyclones the cyclone at the beginning cyclone at the end and and the books all about the relationship with the country and the cyclone and the cyclone in the end gives the whole country a chance to be recreated and to start all over again earth 's breath is not a novel at all it 's a it 's a poem cycle the whole book is one poem well it 's a series of poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it 's all talking about the same experience and that 's susan hawthorne 's experience going through cyclone larry and the book does it in chronological sequence it talks about the lead after the cyclone going through the cyclone and how she feels after the cyclone and briefly she feels that the cyclone has really entered her as a person that she 's imbued with the spirit of the cyclone the um she talks about the cyclone being you know in and with me and and she feels then that having gone through the experience of being in the cyclone she 's never out of it you know it 's always there in her somewhere and so it 's a fascinating poetry cycle to read um and once again i was i was very fortunate to actually talk to susan about it able to sit down have a chat about it when we were doing it i really felt that i had to get her permission really to uh to be able to use it because i talk about it a lot in detail and so i thought i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and she was gracious enough to do that and so we uh we had a great a bit of a um community project really writing about that paltry cycle which is great um and i 've really talked about this so we can probably skim through it i think and i just talked about those books in detail actually in carpentaria and right yes and as i come out with with susan hawthorne um she realizes that her personal experience is part of the global storm experience too and that 's one of the things that my book looks at while we use queensland literature as an example um i 'm also encouraging people in the book to be aware that you know our our storms are everybody 's storms um everybody has experience with storms um you know the the you read some of the books that were written about uh katrina hurricane katrina and new orleans you you see the commonalities you see you realize oh yes you know we 've really all gone through that same experience the storm might have been spinning the other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has that same impact on us so i 'm also i 'm looking at that global storm experience so storytelling is a way in which that acceptance of our country takes place by which place becomes our place by which we gain claim cultural connection and this is the sense of country we have this sense of country we have this cultural connection our stories are not only about place they are of place they don 't simply portray place but are formed by the place itself it 's very interesting for example i don 't know if you know the author janet turner hospital but although she began her writing career in queensland she went overseas and continued her writing career overseas and it 's interesting looking at the differences and the similarities between the stories she writes about here when she 's writing them here and when she 's writing them over there and you know you get that sense of we still have that feeling of country being within us no matter where we are and david malouf stories aren 't much the same too we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we are we 're going to write about it you know and it 's going to sound like country so our stories of cyclones reveal a culture of endurance of survival of resilience and rebuilding and i like this slogan written on the fence or during cyclone debbie which says a lot about our sense of resilience bring it on we can do it in cyclone country then i 'm exploring what the cyclone reveals to us about the impact of weather events on our cultural personal and spiritual landscapes as well as our literal one as i said before we 're looking at all these things writers after all seek to make sense of place as part of their search for meaning one could say that they 're putting into words their tewa as well as their terror as they seek meaning in catastrophe catastrophe always seems to us so random so if if you look at streets that are hit by cyclones or bushfire so that matter you know you have that experience of this house goes and that house stays you know this p these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the foundations you know you 've got that randomness about it and it 's also got that randomness about um where a cyclone strikes you know cyclones have that really interesting habit of wandering you know the weather the weather bureau may seem to say well we 've got the track sorted out it 's going to be here but then it comes down here and then it does a bit of a u-turn and then it goes out there and it comes back and wanders around a little yeah we 've had cyclones um in queensland that have done the complete u-turn they 've gone south come back gone up gone over to the gulf come back again you know so we have that sense of randomness in in it as well and and so part of our way of trying to sort it out part of our way of coping with it is to see if we can make sense of that randomness to see if we can make sense out of that chaos and so writing stories and reading the stories the people have written is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of developing that relationship that we have with with our country our sense of our place in this connected world is enriched by our exploration of our environment it 's also enriched by our willingness to explore and to look outward into those other places as we experience the ebb and flow of interchange between us and the world yes we 're impacted by the cyclone but so are other people our storms are other people 's storms yeah we have a commonality of experience we have a storm community if you want to think about it that way so while it 's our country here the globe is also our country as well you know and we have that commonality of experience so these relationships between nature and culture between people and weather between language and art between life and natural environment between us and our country are expressed in our stories this is why our stories are so important and this is why i write about them thank you [Applause] christopher thank you very much for coming to talk to us today it 's been a fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you does anybody want to ask me any questions about this just a comment or two expressed you mentioned people carry with them the store i lived the northern beaches here for 18 years from 1973 onwards and i connected with a lot of people who were in tracy cyclone tracy in darwin in 1974 and they were traumatized and that didn 't leave them it diminished but it didn 't leave them and the weight of spelling cyclone was p s y c l o w n exactly indeed yes you know and she talks about the same way she says yes now the experience doesn 't doesn 't leave you um you know when you 're right in the middle of it like that and and particularly um i think one of the things that sticks with people most is the noise yeah the actual sound of it and you get that in that in the cyclone tracy museum in darwin when they play that they recorded the church then and played the noise play the noise back to you and it 's it 's that 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cyclonia it 's like a green agreement because it stays with you it gets wet um the cyclone you had up there bring it on [Music] on box breath cafe they put up a big plywood window protection and somebody spray painted i 'll kiss my yasi speaking of names though we 'll talk about yasi what what might interest you is that um we named the storms get named after the meteorological weather district where the storm originates okay so debbie got named debbie because it originated here yasi of course didn 't originate here yasi originated in fiji and was named by the fijian weather district and unlike our system their system also allows them to use the names of objects so yasi actually means sandalwood so if you think of it being called cyclone sandalwood instead of cycloniasi think about that comparison in your in your in your head for the rest of the day and think about how we how differently would we have treated the cyclone may be if we 'd been calling it sandalwood instead of yarsi because one of the other interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we saw that with debbie for example um it is the generalization the characterization of the cyclone and this there 's a whole another field out there on this one about the way particularly about the way media treats i was interested that there 's a woman in america a colleague of mine has just written a book about the way the american media treats hurricanes and reacts to the names of hurricanes and characterizes the storm see good storms and bad storms um along with male and female storms you know and and and it i think the probably the example we had here was larry because larry is such a laid-back name it was interesting that at the time no one took the cyclone really seriously until it landed here because everyone just went oh larry you know larry 's a bit of a larrikin you know and that was interesting reading some of the poetry that was written by the children down in um innocent um but they they drew that into their poetry that that larry was the larrikin who went around and vandalized things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaded their homes and broke their windows you know and it was it was very interesting characterization of the storm according to the name so it 's interesting and the media now does that very very quickly you know almost before the storms got started they start to develop and so next time we have one you might want to look at that as soon as the storm gets started we start getting that flavor in the media of who the storm is not what it is but who it is as a person probably because that 's how this how the media sees they can people can keep it in their head keep track of it we see it as a person not just as a web it 's an interesting way of looking at it anything else anybody wants to ask [Music] kristin it might be a completely different realm but do they have stories where they referred to cyclones before white people came to australia that 's a very interesting question and i think probably not so much here there 's more up around the gulf i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulf region than down this way and i think that 's simply because the indigenous people knew it was coming and got out of the way and by the time the cyclone got here they were over the other side of the range so i don 't think they hung around to create stories about it um so you certainly don 't have that sense as the carib indigenous people have you don 't have that sense of them sitting around developing stories about cyclones but that 's here up around the gulf they did and um as uh alexis wright has in her book she has a character in her book an indigenous person who is a magic man and a cyclone creator he can actually stir up the cyclone there 's a particular spot on the coast where these particular rock formations are where if he can go out there and start stirring up the water with the right stick and he starts stirring up the storm next minute you 've got a big storm happening you know so you 've certainly got those kind of legends up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charlotte by cyclone where all those people died yes it was in a way um so that was yeah that 's i think that was i 'm not a real fan of the book but um sorry but uh no you 're right on that exactly um the devil 's i think was the devil 's life yeah i think it 's the devil 's eye i think it was yes and that is the storm he was writing about yeah but he changed a lot about it so it 's really faction you 've got to be aware when you 're reading it that it 's faction because he 's actually changed a lot for the purpose of writing for the purpose of his story um but he did clearly research a lot of the details about it and it gets a lot of the atmosphere of the storm pretty right yeah but but he 's he 's mixed the two he 's done the factual research he 's yeah so it 's what i like to call faction in the yeah it 's based on fact but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it 's a bit i think he should have probably delineated it a bit more anyway that 's just my preference thanks yeah thanks for bringing that up though yeah no that is it 's an interesting book to read yeah and in your book i guess you cover like town townsville south of town no no i 'm looking at the whole coastline all the way up yeah and um up into the gulf region because you know i 'm addressing where she is um i was in terms of here i was trying i was keeping it within queensland so i 'm talking about tropical cyclones really but um but as i was saying before i do look at some of the literature about tropical storms in other parts of the world um as well as that so um there 's quite a lot of it um and i 'm just trying to do a representative we were the first country to do it um the americans came along a couple of years later but but they the idea had started over there but for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it as being a great idea here a bit quicker and we got the legislation through and started to do it a couple of years before they got there i think and then i think that was probably simply bureaucracy the bureaucracy was simply here and there i think in terms of the people in charge thank you very much everyone i really appreciate you coming along thank you,"(-16.9203476, 145.7709529)"

consulting business in North Carolina but I 'm Canadian and I have been here for a couple of weeks doing some speaking at conferences so this my last couple of days they 've persuaded me to come to Cairns and and do some separately about how to meet dogs and how your dogs can meet other dogs so what I 'd like to do is give you a few extra tips so that you can be translators for your dogs this is what I feel like I do as an animal behaviorist as I and we really want to make sure that our dogs trust us so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them approach them in ways that they like and have them meet their friends in ways that they like and of course this is all in the name of anticipating any problems and keeping ourselves safe into the park and socializing she 's three years old that 's not really socialization socialization happens when dogs are puppies it is the first between eight and sixteen weeks of age is the sensitive period it doesn 't mean old dogs can 't learn it doesn 't mean we can 't get them used to other things in their life but it 's really easy at a very young age and that 's the critical socialization period so safely and avoiding some of the diseases that puppies are susceptible to before they get all of their vaccines so there 's our Kay Anderson is an American veterinarian who wrote a really great letter on the importance of puppy classes of getting puppies out to socialize them I can tell you that there are no diseases that can leap off the ground and infect your puppy while they 're being carried but I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet people and she stayed off the ground other things you need to know is do not take your new puppy to a place where sick dogs might have been the worst disease they can get parvo virus can live in the ground for quite some time but if you 're out on the esplanade if you 're on concrete it 's a little less of a risk if you 're carrying the puppy it 's much less of a risk go to places where when I lived in San Francisco there was one there 's one area that they steam cleaned every morning so that was quite safe for the for me to take my young puppy so you have to sort of balance out many more dogs have problems because they 're poorly socialized and I have parvo so balance it out figure out with your vet read up check out the RK Anderson letter early puppy classes can be a great way to do this the right way when you 're socializing your puppy people I 've seen people do this really a little fright a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their arms and I 'll say here be friends with my puppy even if the puppies say I don 't know this person I 'm a little worried so there 's two ways to do this one is you can make good things happen when people come over the other way is just take them somewhere and hang out so when I took my little puppy to hang out in San Francisco we might be at the beach I might be standing back from everything and I 'm gonna watch her body language to see when she 's ready to go meet new people and just sort of hanging out until the puppy gets bored and be a little more useful than jamming treats into them the whole time and getting them looking at you rather than looking at the people we want them to absorb the things during the sensitive period that they need to absorb so here 's a puppy meeting some firemen and you can see that he is allowed to go at his own place he pace he 's not being jammed in the firemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this is Mia 's little pup Roo Rudy when he was younger he 's a farm dog so he needed to see a lot of things he needed to get familiar with vehicles and equipment but he also needed to meet sheep and I believe that 's an echidna in the middle which I don 't have to socialize dogs in my country but just allowing him to explore at his own pace if he 's a little bit fearful you can add in some treats if you need to it 's also really really easy to teach puppies things with positive reinforcement training when they 're tiny there 's a couple of my favorite puppy resources here the Kiko pup YouTube channel Ian Dunbar 's dog star daily they 've got lots of free material out there on how to train your puppy with positive reinforcement this is a little puppy that belonged to a client of mine she got her just a little bit too young she doesn 't even have all of her teeth yet but look at how quickly she 's learning how to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six weeks old girl we 're teaching her to sit yes show your face she wants really badly to high-five moving her into a sick is marking feeding I 've got a couple of downs out of her see if we can get another one I 'm just letting her lick my fingers I 'm holding them down yes good girl and I 'm releasing the whole chunk of food to her because she 's in her down what a smart puppy who says babies can 't learn oh yes perfect start any time my little four week old puppy was mini to sit down high five by the time she was five minutes old I 've gotta feed them anyways you might as well feed them and and teach them it 's really important for puppies to meet other dogs it 's a lot of folks want to keep them until they have all of their vaccines but if you take the dog to meet your friends dog in your friend 's yard where no sick dogs have ever been and your friend 's dog is vaccinated that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will caution you not all adult dogs love puppies so check with them first that this is a dog who likes puppies and take them over and let them let the play or even have their dog come over to your house so here 's my friend Amy 's older whippet Nick 's help they introduced a new whippet to the house and this this older whip it 's really good with puppy she gives them appropriate feedback she 's doing a really good job of teaching her dog language there 's nothing better to learn our language around them an older dog it 's really important to not to over face your puppy here 's a puppy who came to my farm I thought she knew what other dogs were but I put too many dogs in with her I should have done this one at a time and if you look at this pup whose body language she 's clearly saying this is too much for me I you 're doing this too fast so this is where the bathtub trying to avoid her ears back she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dogs out and we took it a little more slowly by the end of the evening she was playing with all three of my dogs so a few definitions let 's go through what is desensitization so imagine you 're afraid of spiders so if I have that puppy who 's afraid of larger dogs just throwing her into the mix at the dog park but it 's not it 's kind of like throwing a tarantula in your lap if you 're scared of spiders does that make you feel better or worse so a desensitization is something you can do with older dogs as well as puppies and if I was scared of spiders maybe I wouldn 't start with a real spider maybe I start with a stuffed spider maybe kind of far away kind of a small stuffed spider you 're Australian 's you should be terrified of spiders they all want to kill you here so there 's a spider we 're feeling okay with that spider let 's bring them a little bit closer are we still okay with that spider if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the stuffed spider a little bit closer this is not a spider who 's gonna bite you so this is what a sensitization looks like is just exposing them to something in a way that 's not scary counter conditioning on the other hand is trying to change the dog 's mind about what 's in front of them so if you have an older dog and they 're afraid of something you want to expose them to the thing they 're afraid of and then you want to give them something that 's the equivalent of a hundred dollar bill so giving them a little piece of dry kibble might not be enough if they 're afraid of dogs we can move them further away from the dogs and give them a piece of maybe cheese or sausage and then we do it again there 's a spider there 's your hundred dollar bill and then we do it again and you 're gonna gradually get them closer and closer to a real-life situation so it 's really important to find the thing that 's your dog 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you put me on a roller coaster and you said today I shall give you a salty cracker if you riding this rollercoaster I 'll be like see ya I 'll be at the snack bar but if you had a hundred dollar bill I might do it I 'm hungry enough maybe chocolate truffles would do it but I 'd have to be pretty starving to be on a roller coaster for a Saltine so one of the best things we can do to be a good advocate for our dog is to learn how to speak dog so I 'm going to give you a few tips on canine body language this is something I could talk about for weeks this is a very small tip of the iceberg introduction to canine body language please go do your own research there 's some great books DVDs videos continue learning I 'm still learning how to speak dog and I 've had dogs for more than 40 years so one of the most important thing when we 're talking about socializing does we 're talking about meeting dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to really understand what the stress signals of dogs look like so this dog is doing what 's called a tongue flick he 's just got a little bit of tongue coming out of his mouth and then it pops right back in that 's a really subtle stress signal we should also know what affiliative or friendly signals look like so here 's the dog who 's being very welcoming this is actually the full brother of the dog you just saw who was so worried very different personality the first dog you saw would not want to meet you maybe after he 's known you for a year you could pet him this guy if I brought a man there 's my pitbull Theodore he 's from a dogfighting bust he loves everybody if he was in here he 'd be racing around trying to make out with all of you he 'd be sitting on the chairs very very affiliative friendly dog a very different body language we 're not exactly like our brothers are we they come up quite different so here 's some signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dilated his eyes are very round he is probably doing some of the stress signals the lip licking the tongue flicking the yawns other things we need to know is that the concept of consent we 've been talking a lot about consent with the whole me movement the last few years and I 'd like to extend this to dogs we should really ask for the dog 's consent before we do things to them one of the littlest feeling since I met is here today not here Oh hopefully he 's watching on life he told me that kids have a bubble you can 't just pick them up and turn them upside down here apparently you have to respect their bubble I thought oh that 's pretty cool did you know that your dog has a bubble too and we need to respect our dog 's bubble so here 's the dog who is meeting a man in uniform for the first time the dogs a little bit fearful this is the first time meeting someone in uniform and you can see the dog has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is feeding her some snacks to help her feel better about this so what kinds a bird oh she 's your German Shepherd German [Music] okay years fantastic dogs me policeman who is respecting the dogs bubble he is not reaching into the dog space he 's allowing the dog to approach him the owner is trying to help his dog become a little more okay with people in uniform that can be scary some dogs so we are always going to be the translators protectors and the advocates for our dogs all except for the stuffed one you can do anything you want to him he doesn 't have a bubble a little bit of dog body language so when you 're looking at a dog just sort of glancing as you walk by you might catch a glimpse of a face that looks like this and I 'm sure a lot of you are having different feelings about this dog some people see this as a playful dog some people see this as a potentially aggressive dog but this is just one snapshot in time you 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence you can 't tell what the sentence is about you can 't tell it the paragraphs about you can 't tell what the book is about but if you look at a little wider shot you can see there 's more going on some of you were nervous about that scary-looking pitbulls looking off the screen but now that you pull back a bit you can see he 's with a friend both of them have bent elbows it looks more like play now right what if we pull back even more and take a look at the full paragraph and put it in motion so yeah they were playing but look there 's a third dog you didn 't even see that stairs I just kind of grumpy she was older I don 't care grandma go back plate and there 's there 's a whole book too these are my three dogs I could talk the rest of the evening about what 's going on with these three dogs what I know about them so it 's helpful to think of behavior is being on a spectrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive dog the Doberman on the right is a half the friendly dog you might think she looks angry there you might think she looks happy on the right that 's the same dog on different things in different circumstances it 's hard to say that I mean I 'm Canadian you might say well she 's probably polite then maybe I might not be polite some days you can 't make generalizations based on seeing me once and with dogs let 's try to avoid labeling them and look at what 's going on around them so if I 'm deciding if I want to approach the dog one of the things I look at first is where they are on the loose versus stiff spectrum so if Luce is way over on this side of the room and stiff is way over on this side of the room where does this dog fall on the spectrum [Music] [Music] hey side of the room is here this says he can get it father I talked about if you is any more loose what about this dog same breed how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he on the loose versus stiff spectrum where is he on loose versus steps he 's all the way the other side and people laugh at that video but if I had to go into the kennel and get that dog I would be very careful with him because he 's not giving me any friendly signals at all and I 'd like to teach you to not approach dogs not oh people like being hugged and kissed by every single person they meet on the street and not all dogs like it either so if the dog is not giving you friendly signals it is fine to leave them alone and I would urge you to please leave them alone as an advocate for the dog so we need to take things in context this is a very terrifying looking Doberman isn 't he you can see all of his teeth very dramatic this is my dog Duncan and again this is just a snapshot in time but what 's the whole story he 's actually playing he makes a lot of faces when he 's playing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somebody catches you making an expression that 's that 's what Duncan 's like he has a lot of good expression those two are really good playmates so teaching you some of the more subtle signals about dogs may help you avoid making the kettle boil so if this kettles on the stove you 're gonna hear some little crackles and pops before it boils you 're gonna feel the bubbles sort of start to shake the kettle you 'll start seeing steam before you hear the whistle so being able to read some of the more subtle signals of dog body language will help you take that kettle off the stove back off change how you 're handling the dog before they have to whistle and growl and snap and bite so when I 'm deciding what to do with the dog a lot of us look at the tail and we 're like oh he 's wagging he wants to interact yeah he might want to interact it may not be in a positive way wagging does indicate arousal interest and interactive but it he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so I look at the dog 's eyes when I 'm deciding how how the dogs feeling and this is again hard we 're focusing in on one body part we 're gonna put it all together in a minute but the dog on the left you can see his eyes are squinty they 're almond shape they 're kind of soft and the reason they 're squinty is because the facial tension isn 't there he 's very relaxed he 's if you could see the rest of the dog he 's kind of sleepy there he 's floppy in the middle is when he became an old dog he had a bit of doggy dementia and he would spend hours at night pacing and panting and worried about things and you could see the facial tension is pulling his eyes up into a pure and it 's pretty much a perfect circle and there 's also a lot of white showing on the right he 's got his eyes squinty but he 's showing a lot of white and this dog used to freak people out because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at where he is on loose versus stiff first rather than saying Oh lots of white showing scary dog he 's actually just looking off to the left he 's looking out the window both of his eyes are pointing in the same direction and his body languages is soft there his eyes are squinty there are some signs of affiliative behavior these dogs are being friendly he 's he adores being friendly towards his sister Maggie there and being friendly towards my friend cat he has full choice to leave he 's not being held there it is his choice to interact this is what affiliative behavior looks like this this is his first time meeting a kid who came to my farm and again this was out Theodore greets everybody you won 't get me open you though yes stay down is scratching him rather than squashing him most dogs do not love being squashed and Theodore has the full choice to leave if he wants to and he 's choosing to stay there he 's wiggling he 's wagging he 's pressing it as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he had was ever human he 's ever met there 's some more signs of affiliative or friendly behavior the soft eyes the squinty eyes you see how relaxed both of these dogs faces are that often goes with an open mouth I like dogs who are breathing you can see the ears are back the mouth is open everything relaxed and inviting about these these two dogs this guy is now begging for some food this is an alert he looks a little more intense here his eyes are a little more around his ears and forward definitely an alert some people might be worried about this expression he 's just he 's just begging for food here now in general the more white you can see the more upset the dog is unless they 're a dog who just shows a lot of white students I like the one I showed you the dog on the left is having a medical issue she 's having a neurological issue she might be in pain she might be confused but her eyes very round you can see a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away Li the dog on the right is my little dog Lili who hates having bats and she is sitting outside the shower curtain saying please please please don 't give me a bath she 's quite worried about about it you can see it in her face here 's the dog with the way alive for a good reason [Music] it 's a little business very wise for young dogs to learn that cats are pointy the ears are a little bit tougher because it had you have to take into context what the rest of the body is doing in general ears that are forward or more alert focusing in on something it with a dog like Lili on the right you can see her ears can 't do quite as much Theodore 's ears can go from all the way forward to all the way back because the dog fighter had them crop them off so he 's he doesn 't have a full ear Lili on the right she can only move the base of her ear but you can see it can go all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluffy ear Doug look at the base of the ear to see with what they 're focusing on now we 're getting towards the expressions where the dog 's kettle is boiling once they start showing their teeth the dog on the Left has what 's called an offensive pucker all of his his lip is short and pushed forward the dog on the right is showing what 's called a gait his lip is long and pulled back so both of these dogs will bite you don 't get me wrong but you can tell a little bit more about where it 's coming from by knowing something about their body language here are some worried fearful faces again there 's my my dogs brother Wickham on the left he 's at the vet you can see all the facial tension I love my pities in my Dobies because they have such expressive faces they don 't have a lot of hair to cover up all those wrinkles so I find them easier to read than the fluffy dogs but both of these are our faces of concern here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home he is very fearful of these type of these tiles a lot of dogs don 't like to be on slippery surfaces there 's things you can do to help and his mom is making a trail of cookies out onto the tiles he 's trying to get that last one back to my safe spot from the same family as Theodore who loves everybody another thing to take note of is whether the mouth is closed or open this is Duncan he 's just noticing something off to the right he 's got his mouth open he 's panting and then he suddenly closes his mouth so he can concentrate on whether the person who just pulled up is a friend to visit with or not and look at the rest of the face both of these dogs have their mouths open but are they both feeling affiliative friendly outgoing now every time you see Wickham you 're gonna you 're gonna see a face of fear that 's pretty much that that 's how he spends a lot of his life he doesn 't he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan on the left his tongues just flopping out of his mouth it 's a very relaxed face he 's on way down on the loose end of the spectrum you can look at the dog 's length of lip you can see all of these dogs the lip goes almost all the way to under their eyes these are all dogs who are worried about something they the two on the right are at the vet you can see all of the facial tension all of the wrinkles on these guys as the dog alerts to something in front of them they might close their mouths and the lip might shorten up a little bit this is Lele just noticing something down the trail this is not a sign of aggression but as the lip gets shorter the dog is giving more of a threat and you can see the dog on the right even her whiskers have popped forward she 's shortened that lip up so that 's what they do right before they might growl snap fight so really pay attention to the length of the lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of stress as well it could be heat stress or it could be psychological stress so which of these dogs is hot yeah the one on the left is hot the one on the right is that the veterinary czar veterinary it 's office anybody here have a submissive Grinner not a dog who RINs that you like this it looks scary when you first see it I almost wet myself the first time a dog came up I was a little kid Border Collie came up whittling and wagging and showing all of her teeth but these dogs you can see how soft their eyes are they 're usually wiggling and waggling everything about their body is soft but they show their teeth and they get misunderstood a whole lot I 'll go through a few stress signals before we go into how to meet dogs because we really need to know these denotes the dogs having a good time so here 's some little things that dogs do that indicate they 're really subtle indications of stress this is the lip lick or a tongue flick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs just finished dinner maybe there 's cleaning some dinner off their face but if you go up to pet a dog and you reach down and they start lip licking maybe you 're making them nervous this dramatic look away on purpose can be a stress sign and say he 's saying I don 't really want what you 're offering my Doberman if I take her out in public and somebody comes up to patter she will do one of these she 's just like I don 't know you I don 't really like being molested by strangers they 'll do this so here 's a dog doing a dramatic turn away see the dogs getting in her face there 's a yawn and then look away so that was very deliberate she 's she 's diffusing the tension there sometimes a dog will sniff on purpose this dog sniffing just because she 's out on the trail I put some snow in for you Australians but look at the context so this dog is having a bit of an encounter again watched the dog with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she looks away and she starts sniffing so this is a displacement signal she 's saying I mean you no harm other things that a dog might do when they 're stressed they might shake off they might groom themselves we do this we on our finger nails we play with our hair for a little bit nervous and they might just start scratching for no reason here 's a shake off well that was a big Doberman they might also start doing zoomies if they 're stressed I do some agility with my with my little yellow dog and if she 's worried about something she I start I see a lot of dogs do zoomies and agility if you 're kind of over facing them a bit there 's Lele meeting a Doberman for the first time the little yellow dog is a little worried and you 'll see her get her energy out by doing some zooms around the yard that 's that 's just dissipating a bit of excess energy because that Dobermans being just a little too much for her what a zoo means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a little bit too much for her so now that I told you about this placement signals I want you to see what 's going on with these with these two yellow dogs I want you to watch all of the lip flicks but look aways the yawns signs of stress on these guys please to play right thanks to her that way beyond with leg click leg the boys are kind of oblivious but these two girls are having a real conversation here all right no no not all right oh that was too much and you 'll also see that shake off if you over pet them if you 're petting a dog and when you 're done the dog walks away and shakes off all the cooties maybe you were a little bit too much for them to just like that was a little bit too much for those dogs well go through a few things that humans get wrong a lot of us think that all dogs want to meet all of us and we need to make them love us no matter what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by playing hard-to-get than by inflicting yourself and a lot of people think all dogs want to have dog friends and this is not necessarily true either and it 's okay for them not to not to want to a few other things that we get wrong I 'll go through these one at a time sometimes people think a dog who 's yawning is bored but you just saw my dog yawn when she was absolutely not bored she was quite stressed we might think because the dog is wagging they 're happy they want to meet us not necessarily freezes something I 'm going to talk about when a dog holds very still whenever I see suddenly ins out of the blue the dog bit somebody I would really like to see video of what happened because dogs don 't usually do things without warning maybe if they 've got a brain tumor or something but that 's very rare but really often what we don 't read is the freeze they 've given us a warning we didn 't see it that 's not a warning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us bitten I 'll talk about it a bit about the guilty look and about belly rubs so here 's a few dogs who are yawning because of stress you can see how wide they 're opening their mouths how they 've got their eyes squished closed and you can almost hear the squeak to these yarns everywhere you hear your dog 's squeak when they yawn these are stress dogs well we 're looking at tails I want to take into account where the tail is there 's a lot to talk about other tails this is just a brief brief introduction to reading dogs so look at where it is compared to what 's normal for your dog is it up higher that may indicate a willingness to interact it might be good willingness it might be not-so-good willingness if it 's down lower they might be fearful or worried or they might be a greyhound so know know what 's normal for this dog so this is my Doberman Maggie her normal tail position is pretty upright on the left on the right I 'm making her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused and her tail is lower so another thing you can look at is how loose and Wiggly the dog is think about that first boxer he couldn 't even keep his paws on the ground at the same time you can also look at how curved the spine is on these dogs this is rugby he 's excited about everything I don 't think I 've ever seen his spine straightened out so here 's a dog who 's wagging her tail if you had walked into the room and you saw this dog wagging would you think she wants to meet you he 's staring out the window all the hair on her back is up she 's not even looking at me I 'm behind her but she 's wagging so I don 't want you to think that every dog who 's wagging wants to interact with you what she 's looking at is a squirrel outside the window and what she wants to do is go kill it so she would be happy to kill the squirrel but she 's not giving me any friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there so this pictures from a blog by Nicole Wilde called the threat of stillness and it 's a really good read if you 're new to body language and she talks about how dogs will freeze before they it 's one of the warning signals that they 're a little bit over threshold different species don 't really understand freezes like I said it 's not in our repertory if the toddler walks up to a food build and the dog freezes they won 't necessarily see that as a threat chickens also don 't understand this you see the short mouse on that dog the short lift I think is pretty oblivious I have seen people be this oblivious to dogs who are clearly freezing clearly giving the morning so what do we want to do when we see a dog who 's upside down dog bellies are the best thing in the world and we must rub them alright I would say wrong this particular dog if you look at the the rest of his body language there 's nothing friendly about this dog he 's rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites of his eyes he 's doing a tongue flick so he 's doing what 's called a tap out if you 're wrestling and you want to say enough you can tap the floor twice and say please stop this dog is saying please stop and I have seen people go up to dogs who have rolled over in a knock it off kind of way and rub that belly and you can put yourself in a lot of danger this dog is asking to stop and we miss read it so if you look at these two gods one of them is on the loose end of the spectrum one of them is on the stiff end of the spectrum I don 't think the guy playing upside down with his toy necessarily wants a belly rub but you can see how much looser and fluffier he is his tails flopped out between his legs the one on the right her tails tucked she 's looking away you can see the whites of her eyes she 's very stiff but a lot of people would rub her belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the rest of Karen 's this is a tap out this is not a dog who 's asking for attention so one big concept that I 'd love to get across to you guys is the concept of giving dogs choice I do dog cat and horse behavior consulting and when I first meet an animal I have had people say this cat never comes out from under the couch when people are here what are you doing differently and I will tell you I am giving them choice playing a little bit hard to get will actually get you further the people who love animals the most are often the ones driving them away with too much attention this is a really good video about choice so watch this girl she would like her she would like to give her dog a hug dogs don 't particularly like being hunt the only time dogs hug one another is when they are fighting or when they are mating they 're not really wired to enjoy that frontal frontal contact look at this dog is he 's saying please give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lip licks look at the way like but watch what happens when she takes her hand away comes right oh is this dog enjoying this hug watch the dog 's eyes watch the dog 's lips though this is a go away kiss you 'll see dogs give this this is a kiss too dismissed is the dog enjoying this hug now most dogs don 't enjoy hugs they 'll tolerate it it 's a very tolerant dog didn 't growl didn 't bite her but now she 's got the choice again dogs out of there what about this little dog this is a fearful little dog that I look after sometimes is she enjoying this interaction see the lip lip yeah that she 's saying I 'm a little worried about this person 's not particularly hearing it how about this stud look at where the tail is or the ears this went to you 're gonna see some lip licks here the flick lip lick and look at the body weight shift not fun for her was it so the moral of the story is we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some choice let them come to us there 's a dog doing a lip lick not sure if you just finished a snack or if he 's enjoying this it 's hard to tell from just one word and if you do interact with a dog a good idea is to use the three-second rule so if you see a dog like this everything 's friendly everything 's welcome right giving them a scratch dogs don 't really like being petted but they like being scratched so try a little scratch on the chest try a little scratch under the collar and then stand back and see what the dog says do they want more do they shake off and move away so I 'm going to torment this for a little shy dog again tell me if I made for better or worse we want to make the dogs better every time we interact with them is she saying please pet me is anything about this I couldn 't bring myself to pet her on the head for the video but shoving my hand in her face is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more than three seconds the lip lick does she feel better about me after that interaction I felt better she 's very soft and warm didn 't make her feel any better so there 's nothing magical about your hand there 's nothing I wish they would quit teaching people to shove hands into dog 's faces that 's that 's kind of scary for a lot of them your hand has zero magical properties and this is where we get bitten more often than not is the hand of the lower arm and often the thing that happens right before that is we shoot that hand out so I want you to watch this dog tell me if there are any friendly signals towards the person holding the camera but you 'll see the person shove their hand and the dog 's face multiple times okay okay without showing any friendly signals for the person looking at [Music] yeah so this is a redirected bite the dog is looking at something else person comes in and pokes them and they 're just that was very polite that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your hand that makes the dog like you so please stop shoving your hand in dog 's faces if a lot of us believe our dogs feel guilty if we come home and we see that something 's torn up and we yell at them a lot of dogs will give us a look like this if you 'd like to look up some research on it it 's kind of been debunked the dog is reacting to our reaction they don 't really remember what they did four hours ago here 's what Berlin did today and when she was questioned about it she 's not holding out in the shower she 's praying that we blames a pig I find these videos so sad these dogs who are acting guilty they 're actually just reacting to the anger in their in their owners voice and their mannerisms Julie 's research had what they would tell they would leave a cookie on the table and what the owner would walk out and sometimes the researcher would take the cookie away and the dog was still act too guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog didn 't even take the cookie but they 'll still act guilty here 's my dog Theodore who is an artist and he 's never been yelled at for this so he doesn 't feel guilty at all here 's a cool video by instinct dog training it 's a organization in New York City that does board and train and lessons first for dogs and I love this video on greeting dogs if your friends couldn 't make it tonight it 's available on instinct dog training calm but it was a really good illustration of how to greet dogs and how to not read dogs when it comes to saying hello to a new canine friend there are some things humans do that dogs find rude uncomfortable and downright scary let 's review five big don 'ts for greeting a new dog number one the hand sticking your hand in a dog 's face invades their personal space notice how moseys turns his head away to avoid number two they lean over leaning over a dog is intimidating for them see how Moses licks his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three the head pet getting thumped on the head is a key for nervous dogs an unknown hand reaching over the top of their head can be scary too number four a face hold this super invasive greeting includes lots of eye contact at close range and holding their face in both hands makes a dog feel like they can 't move away number five the hug this greeting behavior is also really invasive and scary for many dogs it 's full body restraint at very close quarters the best case scenario with each of these five interactions a set of dog will tolerate but not enjoy them like moseys however many dogs will show aggression lunging snapping or biting to try and create some space for themselves and stop the uncomfortable interaction and it 's a totally understandable response so please keep pups comfortable and keep yourself safe by following these low stress greeting guidelines instead present yourself with your body slightly sideways invite the dog to approach if desired by presenting your open palms stay calm and quiet with a relaxed and happy expression on your keep eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back or side after three to five seconds pause to see if the dog re-engages with you to request more petting following these simple guidelines gives dogs lots of choice and control over the greeting they choose if they want to engage and they choose when it 's over remember you should always get permission from the owner and the dog before saying hello happy greetings some really easy tips I mean we 're all here because we 're dog lovers we want all the dogs to love us but try playing a little hard to get and most importantly give that dog choice give them don 't restrain them in a way that makes them feel like they have no choice so the last little bit I 'll go through here today is on how to introduce your dog to other dogs this is something I see a lot of people attempt to do in ways that that really stress the dog out again this is not an exhaustive list there 's lots more to learn but I 'll just give you a few general tips so what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs are two of the species that play throughout their whole life even even my old dog grandma there she would still chase a ball until her arthritis got so bad that she physically couldn 't get up and chase it so play is communication about communication it is practicing real-world behaviors a lot of young animals will practice everything they need to do in adulthood in play we do this in play too we might play house we might play work we might play all of the things that the adults are doing one of the great things that play can do for dogs I 've been working with shelter dogs for a lot of years I 've been over here for some shelter conferences this fall and play can be really magic if you 've got a fearful dog I used to try to get fearful dogs to change their minds about me by handing them bacon and throwing them sausages in their kennels and sometimes they just hide the whole time I 'm throwing bacon in the kennel and then when I leave their kennels pull the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked and you can actually make them worse this way but I 've found that a lot of dogs will believe another dog before they 'll believe a human so I want you to watch this is a video from dogs playing for life it 's an organization that helps teach shelter dogs how to play and I want you to watch the little tan dog she had to be carried to the play yard she could not walk on a leash she was terrified of the people but watch what the other dog tells her and how her body language changes this is June 2nd it barks and this little this little tan dog this little female well yeah no it 's a good one this one this little tan female back here is like a pancake dog with people scared to death with people and so she just came out and we 're using the tail who 's the bomb-proof dog here to show us how she feels about dogs which apparently it 's okay out here you notice there 's no people in there with her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the play yard she 's gonna start walking there on her own she 's gonna start feeling better about people because people lead to other dogs and that 's the thing that 's helped my my dogs brother Wickham the most is that his owner adopted a second dog who 's super confident and when wickham 's worried about something she just goes up and takes all the social pressure off like hi I 'm the one to greet you leave my brother alone and she helps him feel better about the world because he sees how she interacts with it so not all dogs need to play some some dogs love it some dogs don 't when I was a much younger person I enjoyed going to a nightclub and being squashed in there with lots of other young people I thought that was a fun thing to do now that I am not so young there is not a number of saltines or Triscuits or hundred-dollar bills you could give me to make me spend well maybe hundred dollar bills it would it would take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squished it there with a lot of people and dogs to become a little less interested in meeting every single dog as they got older you saw grandma dog there she was not thrilled even with her brothers playing in front of her as an older person I would enjoy much more playing a game of Scrabble at home with some friends that I know really well so if your dog is a Scrabble with friends kind of dog you do not have to take them to the dog park and make them party with the night club kids it is perfectly okay to let them hang out with their friends I don 't need to meet every single person on the street and give them a big hug and a kiss I 'm Canadian we don 't do that and your dog doesn 't have to either I 'll talk just a little bit about play I find a lot of people miss miss read what the dogs are doing when they 're playing I can tell you if you watch my pitbull and my Doberman play I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might think they 're killing each other what they 're fine I know these dogs well I know their play styles but we do need to step in sometimes so you 're some of the play styles that people talk about that you might have dogs who are kind of gentle and dainty often small dogs fall into this category whether in the same orbit and they 're sort of both trotting around maybe with the toy in their mouth but not really interacting heavily with one another some dogs prefer to chase that 's a fun thing for dogs some like to be the bunny some like to be the Fox a lot of dogs like to wrestle I love my pities my bully breeds they they are really close contact wrestlers a lot of them not all of them some are gentle and dainty some are chasers but it 's important to know your dog when you 're trying to get make them a friend so I promised you this brace yourself here 's my pitbull and my Doberman on my little farm in North Carolina you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're fine you 'll notice the pitbull rolls over on his back alive he 's playing defense he can use all of his claws against the new format if he eats food when he 's upside down those patient parts of the world this is early in the morning it 's pretty rough anything they can get even rougher than that but but they 're they 're fine with that here 's a couple of dogs who like to chase this golden retriever has never played with another dog in her life she 's at a friend 's house for some board and train and they decided to put her in with a whippet because they knew the Whippet could outrun her and she got upset when dogs got frontal to her that 's very threatening in dog body language so having the Whippet running away actually worked really well for this is her first play session ever of course the Whippet likes to be the bunny there was a little bit of chasing when my two were wrestling as well they can flex back and forth it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change to so if you 're not sure here 's my friend 's dog Dino and he is standing over a Theodore in a way that I 'm fine I might find a little uncomfortable if you look at his eyes they 're a little bit hard there so anytime I feel like Theodore might be uncomfortable what I can do is I usually leave a leash dragging on the unknown dog so if I picked up Dino 's leash and walked away Theodore will tell me that 's that 's called a consent test taking away the bully and then seeing what the victim says so if I walk Dino away and Theodore gets up and says hey what do you do with my friend bring him back maybe that looks stupid maybe it looked like it was too much but they were fine if I pick up Dino 's leash and walk him away in theater or says well thank goodness shake off the cooties that guy 's was too much then I know I was right to interrupt and you can do is consent tests as often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the play that 's happening so some positive signs when dogs are having a good time playing you will often see the ears back sometimes they will rotate so they 're almost touching one another 's like Dino 's are at the top you 'll see some sort of popping movements that really exaggerated bounding that my dogs were doing in the arena with the horses I really like elbow bends you see the extreme elbow Bend on the bottom that 's called a play bow that 's an invitation to play it 's not working on Duncan that particular time but Theo has to try a few of the warning signs again this is not a comprehensive list this is just an overview here 's Kenya with her hackles up is she having trouble with this particular interaction is she looking at a squirrel I 'm not sure you need to take into account in the context when the dog is getting stiff or frizzy like that dog over the food bowl with the chicken the hard I and the fries those are definitely things to take note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're playing like idiots like this is if you 're if you 're not both having fun it 's not fun they were both having fun here they 're really rough players these two but if I wasn 't sure I could do a consent test if I didn 't know these dogs too well I could take the one away that I think is being a victim there are some dogs who will tip into a fight as they get to a certain level of arousal it might tip into a fight if you know this about your dog you need to step in before that happens you always always always want to protect puppies and you always need to protect inexperienced dogs they are a young dog you saw that little puppy in the video earlier on that was one of her first encounters with other dogs and you want those first encounters to be really good she was in her critical socialization period the guy was working on his on the farm and left the puppy in the truck and I said can she come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very friendly with other dogs I and I knew a little goes a long way at that agent I would love her to be a a pitbull who likes other dogs so let 's put it all together let 's look at some of the things that are happening here and see if you recognize any of the body language I 've talked about so far it 's chanting sleeps too much dog where are these dogs on the loose versus stiff scale everybody 's really floppy relaxed they 're going back and forth really nicely lots of bent elbows really some nice play there and that was full that they had the picnic table if the dog felt overwhelmed he could get underneath the picnic table regroup and come out when he was ready so when you 're introducing two dogs this is about the worst thing you can do is introduce them on very tight leashes nobody makes good decisions while they 're being strangled and I think part of the issue with city dogs in particular is that we forced them onto sidewalks so if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got stuck in the front rowing anything you see here as a victim the polite way as a Canadian I 'm assuming this is true in Australia too Rustom eat is for me to come up to you we square off her shoulders to one another make eye contact I shoot out of hand we shake hands that 's a very polite greeting in human language if a dog goes up to another dog at the dog park and they are frontal and they are straight on and they 're looking into their eyes and they shoot out a paw that is very confrontational in dog language and I think a lot of the issues we have with city dogs is they 're on sidewalks and what if sidewalks do it makes them be frontal to one another and they 're put on artificially they 're forced to give each other kind of a hard stare in the eyes but if you watch dogs off leash at the dog park when they meet they come up and they get sideways to one another they 'll circle they 'll sniff one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle so if we had circular sidewalks who wouldn 't have so many problems with God 's the other issue is we don 't teach our dogs to walk nicely on a loose leash many of us just let them pull so if their dogs coming towards the other dog and they 're there strangling themselves by half that 's very scary for other dogs so you know using a harness rather than a collar that makes them do that and teaching them to walk nicely beside you can be really helpful in preventing these tight leashes because these two dogs are not being set up for success right now and they might explode I 'm sure so who in here has a dog who is an idiot on leash likely to explode lunge bark but it 's fine off leash lots of us I 've had plenty of these dogs too this is really normal so just because your dog is not great on leash doesn 't mean they hate all other dogs that might be an artifact of how you 're introducing them so here 's a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with in the state this is a client 's dog watch what happens when he tightens the leash he 's just sniffing this stuff dog on the ground she 's not quite sure if it 's real or not but watch what happens when he when he tightens the leash alright it 's loud [Music] [Music] this dog tension on the leash is like pulling a trigger on the gun as soon as as soon as that tension comes on she 's going to explode and I 'm a lot of us here have dogs like that so we want them to make friends if you have a friendly value if you don 't have a dog who you know is friendly off leash a great way to do that is have them meet the other dog off leash when I do a lot of fostering and when I 'm bringing in a new dog I like them to meet on neutral territory so we might use a friend 's yard we might use a different off-site area so that my dogs aren 't saying hey this is my spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot it 's neutral territory is usually safest if you 're not sure if your new dog likes other dogs you might have a fence in between them and see how they do with the fence some dogs are worse through a friends but many of them they can at least display natural body language they can run up and down and talk to one another through the fence if you 're really not sure it doesn 't hurt to teach your dog to wear a muzzle you 're bringing in a new dog you 're not sure if your dog likes other dogs having them wear make sure it 's the kind of muzzle they can breathe in I like the Baskerville muzzles they are fitted so that the dog can open their mouths they can drink water they can pant especially in this climate you should never muzzle a dog with a muzzle that closes their mouth so this little kelpy mix was a dog who was quite reactive in the shelter she would lunge and bark and make all kinds of noise they thought she might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off leash with these I knew the other two dogs were friendly and tell me if she 's dog aggressive so I left them a few more minutes and by the time the little interaction was over she was soliciting play rolling around on her back with these other dyes so here 's the dog who 's meeting Theodora I actually did this introduction on Theodore 's territory because he loves all dogs so much I was not worried about him defending it the pointer has not been around other dogs for many years I wasn 't sure how she was going to feel about meeting my dogs but I was bringing her into foster so they 're gonna greet each other through the fence and I want you to tell me if you would let her and meet Theodore do you play with this how did that look notice what might notice my tone when I 'm doing that introduction am I saying you be nice I taught my first dog to attack on the words you be nice with me tightening the leash so I 'm acting happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead and she was looking fine but keeping your tone light was i hauling back on her leash and making her strangle nope no that is I did have to have a leash on her there wasn 't a there wasn 't another fence outside but that look pretty good right so I 'm gonna let her in with the leash dragging in case she changes her mind and again she hasn 't met a dog in a lot of years [Applause] [Applause] Theodore can hardly stand himself there 's a new girl he 's a little much for her but he backed himself off I looked pretty good right so I took her leash off I kept her a few days and this is what they look like a couple days later which is being a lot more brave now isn 't she Theo 's teaching her how to be a dog how to play with dogs so here 's the pack of dogs I had about ten years ago all but one of them have passed away now when I 'm out with my personal dogs whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet other dogs on leash I 'm a dog trainer I 'm a control freak and I don 't trust all of you to know your dogs not that you live where I do I don 't trust the people in my area to know their dogs they may have just adopted the dogs and be like I need to socialize them with other dogs they might not know if that dog is friendly so I want my dogs job is when we 're out for a walk like this they need to pay attention to me if we see other dogs we 'll give them some space that 's a big pack of dogs we might cross the road or get out of their way but I do I would never let all five dogs rush up to any dog and greet them they might be too much all those the pack and not all of them like meeting strange dogs out of this bunch two of them really didn 't like me new dogs three of them did so if you 're doing an on leash greeting I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greet every dog that you meet as its I prefer for my dogs to meet dogs that I know are social that I know they 're gonna have a good time with the other thing I want you to understand is I have had some really dog aggressive dogs sometimes that if your dog came charging up would bite them and it frustrates me to no end when I 've got one of these dogs out and you 're out there with your friendly Labrador off leash in an area where it 's supposed to be always and your dog comes charging up to my dog aggressive Akita mix and you say it 's okay he 's friendly your dog being friendly is not going to make my Aikido mix love having a Labrador in his face and you 're putting your dog at risk people who have dogs who don 't love other dogs need a safe place to walk them so if you 're going to let your dog off leash they should have a really good recalling should be able to call them off other dogs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who have dogs who don 't love other dogs a spot to be sometimes if you 've got a dog who doesn 't love other dogs if I 've got my dog aggressive Akita mix out and we 're just passing on the street I might pull out some string cheese and give him canine hundred-dollar bills as we go past because I 'm gonna try to make him feel a little bit better about being around your dog this is if you have a dog who 's reactive on leash that might work if you 've got something that 's good enough if I have Theodore out with me and he 's dying to meet your dog and you have a puppy who 's Wiggly and waggly and saying can I meet Theodore maybe I will let him greet but it 's gonna be quick because even if he wants to play and I let him come up to your puppy and they start rolling around in the middle of the hardware store having a great time playing they 're just going to get tangled in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to have a great time so if we 're gonna say hi we 'll go up we 'll do a little interaction and let 's go because even if they 're having a great time they can 't really play well on leash and it 's not fun to get them tangled and I 'm introducing new dogs I might take them out for a walk in parallel we might start on opposite sides of a country road sort of sniffing interesting things and sort of gradually get closer and closer the one of these dogs is not keen on other dogs she 's like well being pretty close to them and her owner has some hundred dollar bills some treats in a can that he can spray through that muzzle when she 's as she 's getting closer to help her feel better about this here 's Theodore doing some therapy with a little dog who 's afraid of street noises so this parallel walk is for a reason and I 'm holding both of them with the same with the same hand these are dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how confident she feels with with the big tough pit bull beside her everything 's all right if I 'm introducing dogs who are not great side-by-side yet I might do a linear walk I might put one in front so that they can pee on things and align one pees on something the other one comes up and pees on it they get each other 's scent this way without that frontal frontal contact they 'll start with one behind and then we 'll switch them around so the other ones in front and by the time we get back from that walk they might be parallel they might be ok with one another there 's a dog that I brought home last year she was she had kennel cough and she was not great with other dogs so I put her in the dining room you can see I 've got a very sturdy mounted metal baby gate on the front and I 've also got a secondary X pen so that she can 't snap it another dog through that baby gate she also had some kennel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby gate as well just as a sneeze barrier there 's there 's lots of other things you can do you can put them on tethers I like to keep the new dog behind the baby gate until everybody 's board will go up for our walk so we 'll come back and I was able to integrate her eventually but we took it really slowly with her so here 's my god Ken yahooooo sometimes doesn 't like other dogs this is grumpy old grandma and she 's meeting a new foster Doberman this dog has been for a parallel walk with everybody else in the household he 's very dog friendly he 's doing great with the other four this is my problem child and I 've been letting her watch from behind a baby gate the Dobermans in an X pen there 's been no explosions no reaction so I 'm gonna let her come out off leash because she 's not as good on with the leash strangling her and tell me what you think of this body language he 's taking the long way around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netflix little uncertain Dobermans being very appropriate isn 't he he 's really tired from walks with four other dogs see the nice long pause he 's doing [Applause] am i yelling at Kenya am i saying you be nice okay maybe in shakes aww he 's like she 's a little creepy so you saw the little stress signal right are they ready to go up for a walk side-by-side maybe maybe not I waited till the next morning with those two we did that again in the morning they ended up being quite good friends they one thing with Kenya was she was never ever aggressive with a dog who was bigger than her she 's not stupid so I mostly foster Dobermans that I actually ended up keeping that Doberman he became Saint Duncan I don 't like the name Damian so uh I kept him for the rest of his life so what have we learned socialization is for puppies when you are getting your adult dog used to something that 's remedial socialization or that is the sensitization encounter conditioning but doesn 't mean older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with a trainer we learned how to greet dogs and we learned how to give the dogs their bubble respect what they 're saying play a little bit hard to get and we did a little bit on dog introductions this is a very small overview of what you can do with your dogs but thank you for coming I 've been great being here and I 'll hang out for a couple questions after it you,"(-16.9203476, 145.7709529)"

pathologists",q3QnCqLhEcc,20210712,3323.359,"Cairns City QLD 4870, Australia",10675,[Music] um hi everyone my name is kimberly ken this is ladrina welcome to no learn and grow presented by first fire forever cairns regional libraries and little sparrow speech therapy so let me introduce us so we are both speech pathologists from little sparrow speech therapy here in cairns we work with children and adults who have communication delays or disorders and disabilities so today we 're going to go across a little bit about us which we 've just covered um some developmental milestones for children from zero to five years some tips on how to help your child 's development and at the end we 'll be happy to answer any questions and answers so please free to submit them while we 're going through the presentation so first we 'll go through what does a speech pathologist do so we assess diagnose and treat and we do that on quite a few different areas so the first one is speech sounds and that 's the one that most people think of when you think of a speech pathologist that 's the sounds we actually use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common things that we work on the next thing is language now that refers to the how we use words and how we build them and put them together to build a message we then work on our social skills so that 's when and where to use words in our social situation and what not to do and what to do um we also work on literacy so you 're reading and writing and that also includes your spelling as well we work with voice which brings improving the quality of your voice so some people have a husky voice some people have a rough voice some people 's voices stop working altogether and that 's when you would come to see us uh we also work on something called fluency and that refers to the flow of your words so that 's most commonly a stutter for a speech pathologist and um not many people know but we also work on swallowing and feeding so that include your picky eaters or something called dysphagia which means that your swallowing function has become impaired so we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning but the main ones will cover these areas and we thought we 'd go through this first just to help you guys um understand where we 're going to be going with your child 's development so the first main area that we have when we communicate is receptive language so that 's our ability to receive a message and understand the message that has been received we then use expressive language so that 's our ability to build a message and put it out so it can be understood by someone else so these two areas are super important so if we don 't have receptive language we can 't receive a message if we don 't have expressive language we can 't put out a message to someone else um we then have our speech sounds so these are the sounds that come together um to actually build a word and when we 're building these words um that allows us to be understood by other people we then have our literacy skills and that 's our ability to read write and spell and this includes understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your kids in this age group now milestones what to expect when in your child 's development from 0-3 months your child should be able to turn their heads towards you towards your voice or the sound they 've had so for example if um you walk into a room and your little baby is lying in their cot or um on the bed they should be able to localize the sound turn their heads towards you talking um they should also smile and they will quiet down when they hear a sound voice to show that they 're interested um you will also notice that their vocalizations will change for different needs so as a parent i think it 's quite common um to pick up on a cry that shows that they 're hungry or a tired cry and you you know as you go you 'll notice that they 're both quite distinct um they will also begin to coo and smile which is the very cute face um and they will also make two or more speech sounds so little oohs and airs um throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye contact with whoever is standing directly in front of them they will also begin to show interesting faces um especially with mom or dad brother or sister the common ones that you have in your family um and they will also begin to recognize your apartment caregivers so this in most cases would be mom dad grandma granddad whoever is important in your child 's life um from three to six months they will also begin to react to sudden noises or sounds so anything that is loud they might jerk or they might turn your head towards that sound they also like to be spoken to so um as much as you can 't have an adult conversation with kids at that stage they really do enjoy that communication and the interaction that they have with the adults around them or their little siblings and you will also notice that they also begin to laugh at this stage which is very very adorable it 's one of my favorite stages um they will continue to maintain the eye contact with whoever is standing directly in front of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really well so things like peekaboo they will show interest in and i don 't some of like some parents might have noticed that when their child is at this stage if they 're grabbing something in their head it might be a bit tricky to get it off them and they will not be very happy if that happens so from six to nine months when it comes to your child 's communication skills they can recognize the sound of their own name so if you call their name they should turn their head towards it um they 'll look at familiar people or objects when their name so if you name mom or dad or a sibling 's name they should be able to find that person by turning their head in the room and they should be able to name sort of similar objects usually bottles and things like that that are very common to them at this age um they can follow some routine commands when they 're paired with a gesture so that means when you use your hands as well to communicate so up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stage and they 'll begin to make repetitive sounds so this is when you 'll start to hear mum and dad um with their social skills from six to nine months they 'll start to enjoy games like peekaboo so they 'll really enjoy games where they get to take turns with you whoever is their main caregiver they 'll take turns vocalizing with others so it 'll sound like you can have a conversation with them in this age so you 'll say something and they might coo back to you or make one of those sounds back and you can usually go back and forth and they thoroughly enjoy these games at this age and it 's a really good step towards them taking turns when they communicate with you when you 're they 're a little bit older they 'll begin to feed themselves they 'll make a big mess of it but they will begin to feed themselves and that 's an important step for them as well they 'll be able to react to themselves in the mirror which is lovely to watch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're not familiar with they will begin to cling to you and show fear at this age as well by 12 months or um by their first birthday they should be able to say at least two clear words and this can be a really simple words that you know they see every day and they look at every day so things like mum dad car bed teddy up um they should also continue to babble and this will resemble uh sounds and rhythms of speech so pretend they will sound like they 're having a conversation with whoever is talking to them at that point um they will also continue to bubble to themselves which is very cute very entertaining to watch sometimes um and they will also begin to use simple gestures and actions such as waving bye-bye when you leave a place putting their hands up if they want to be picked up um they should also begin to point to things that they want so common ones are they will point to their milk bottle if they 're hungry they will point to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed if they 're feeling tired um they should also begin to shake their head to indicate no which is a very important one for your child that at that age um and they will also begin to understand gestures such as no and bye bye socially they should be beginning to develop joint attention and joint attention is so important um as a building block for um later communication skills because it sort of teaches your child that if i 'm looking at something i want my child to be looking at it too and that is again important to building that understanding of the world around them as well and they also should begin to initiate affection which is running up to you for cuddles and kisses and yeah can 't get enough of that i two years they should be able to follow two-step instructions so that 's things like go to your room and get your shoes um and they should also be able to point to named objects so things around the house like your chair table teddy um tv things outside flowers bed sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing nursery rhymes and they should be able to say about 20 to 50 words clearly they should also begin to combine these words together in to form two cent two part sentences so if they see a card they might say oh big car or my juice no teddy for example and begin to name simple body parts like eyes nose mouth ears hair and they should also begin to use words like mine and no which is you know at two years old i need to assert myself and put my opinion out there which is perfectly fine um they should also begin to say um sounds in words that require your lips to touch together like your pup [Music] and other sounds like so these are your earliest developing sounds socially they should begin to play games with others so simple things like peekaboo and they should enjoy sitting and looking at books together with you um obviously at this age they wouldn 't be able to read the words in the book but they will enjoy looking at the pictures touching the book feeling the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they show early imaginative play so a common one in girls is when they put their teddy to sleep or put like feed their baby doll um and boys usually it 's you know rolling a car down down your table and saying boom crash beep all the fun language that comes along with playing with cars they should begin to play side by side with their peers or siblings and they should start to help with really simple like dressing routines like putting their shoes on and trying to put a shirt on and with simple tasks around the house as well so they will try and wipe a table may not be very efficient but they 're trying anyway so some things you can do for this age group for your zero to two years to help grow their speech and language now these are some really simple things but they 're often some things that we get lost when we 're really busy in our daily routine where we 've got to get those dishes done we 've got to do the grocery shopping this is stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will really help your child 's development so making sure that your child can see your face when you 're talking now that is number one it helps them see how you 're making the words it helps them with eye contact it helps them read your facial expressions um so we suggest with this one get down to your child 's level um sit down with them on the floor if they can see your face and it 's not as far away then that is the best thing you can do for your child you 'll notice that your child reacts a lot better as well when you do that encourage your child to make a variety of sounds as well so you can really have fun with this so like what drina was saying before with cars boom crash broom all of those things even with the baby dolls wow all of those lovely sounds the kids will really respond to those sounds as well they think they 're really funny um you know to put baby to sleep but they also practice a variety of sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so we encourage encourage you guys to really do that one copy their facial expressions and their vocalizations particularly in the beginning as well um if you do that if they sort of realize that you 're copying them they 'll attempt to do it again in return and it 's a really fun exchange that you guys can build communicating is a back and forth that you do and if you can establish that nice and early with your child it will be wonderful so encourage your child to copy your actions as well so um we don 't just talk with our voices we very much talk with our hands it 's something we do every day when we talk with our bodies as well um we can usually tell from afar as an adult where the person is feeling so it 's really important to help your child with that from the very beginning and you can do that by simple things like clapping and waving and doing actions to songs in the beginning and that will help them learn to use their hands to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of your child is talking about what you 're doing during your daily routines is so important gives them an opportunity to attach what you 're saying to your everyday life so this is probably one of your most important ones so that can be your grocery shopping you 're gonna put the cereal in the trolley we 're gonna get three apples and put them in the bag now we 're gonna put them in the trolley so it doesn 't have to be just a set opportunity you set aside every day to communicate with your child do this every day when you 're putting the clothes on the time we 're pegging up the pants peg on cutting the vegetables in the kitchen is it a vegetable is it a fruit we have to cook it what are we going to do to it have that conversation all day long and you 'll find your child will join you in it and at this age from zero to two we don 't expect them to know all their colors or to be able to count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be surprised at how quickly they can pick these things up at this age so naming the colors of things for them counting items when you go along sing one two three apples in the bag and will be an absolute wonderful strategy for your child now another really big one is giving your child time to respond now this one might feel a little strange but even stepping back for 30 seconds are counting to 30 in your head giving your child that opportunity to exchange and give you their response will be huge and that builds that back and forth that they need when they are learning to build their communication for the first time sometimes it takes a little bit to think of the word that they might be looking for so giving them that time and space and that includes time with siblings so if you notice that you 've got a sibling that will talk straight for your child encourage them to give them space as well um follow your child 's lead so this means picking what your child is interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinosaurs or if they are into having tea parties stop and take the time to do those things and talk about what they 're doing while they 're doing it um that will be huge your truth will know as an adult if we 're more interested in something we 're way more likely to learn about it your child is no different they 're just a little person um expand on your responses as well so this is a really big one so if your child is at the stage where they 're saying a single word say car add another word to it when they say so if they point to a car you can say big car or red car or dirty car if your child is saying two words then you can add a third word for them um and that would be really helpful for them to learn how to build and expand on their sentences so when it comes to so we say pre-literacy skills here because they aren 't reading yet that doesn 't mean they 're not learning the amazing fundamentals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn about them from this age so we suggest you start books from the very beginning there 's no harm in reading a book to your child in fact like we were saying they 'll love hearing your voice um so let them touch feel explore the book if it gets a little damaged it 's not the end of the universe they 've explored they 've learned it takes time to learn to turn a page without damaging it all of those things let them explore and enjoy it doesn 't matter if they read just the last page doesn 't matter if you read the book upside down to begin with as long as you guys are engaging in the same task together it 's not a big deal use sturdy books having said that though for longevity um and ones that are tactile so they have colorful pieces um or even little rubber bits that they can touch and feel that will help them stay engaged for even longer from this age group you start by just naming the pictures so you know cat dog and adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wonderful as well um and then sort of as they grow towards the two years of age you can start adding some describing words with your original name as well by three years um we should expect your child to be able to follow simple three-step instructions so things like go to your room get your shoes and you know get your bag um they should be able to be understood most of the time there 's going to be some times where it 's a bit unclear but most of the time we should be able to understand what your child is saying they should be able to identify what things are used for so for example um toothbrush what do we use a toothbrush for brush your teeth um what do we use a fork for for eating it 's really simple things that they use every day they should be able to tell you what they 're used for they should be able to name a variety of objects and body parts so you know things like your eyelashes your elbows um and name different objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supermarket to the park um they should be able to use a variety of different words so not just your nouns like orange and apple they should be also able to use um little describing words here and there fast slow um and again they should be able to say and that sounds socially they will begin to play games with others um be it hide and seek and they should also continue to demonstrate imaginative play um like kim and i mentioned earlier putting a teddy bear to sleep playing um you know cooking they 've got like a little kitchen set and they might you know cook up a meal and come and give it to mom and dad um playing with cars and trains making them go around the track and um you know pretending that the driver is stopping and go um they should also begin to play with other children and interact around them around like common interests so for example if they see another child that has a dinosaur in their hand they might go up to them and be and say oh i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they will start to have those little mini conversations around things that they like they also should begin to turn take and share um sharing is a tricky one when it comes to children but it 's a good time to start um and they should be able to describe simple feelings such as happy sad or angry and i guess a little tip from here as well is if your child is feeling sad or angry or hungry you can label it for them and that way the next time it happens they will know what that feeling should feel like um and they should also begin to put clothes on with assistance so getting mom or dad 's help to put a shirt on or you know buckle up their pants tie shoelaces that 's a thing by four years um they should be able to name most colors and shapes that they see around the house and you can do this through books through the different toys that you see the road signs when you 're on the road um and they should be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um they should be able to tell stories about what happened in the past or future so for example if you ask them what did you do at kindy today or what did you do at daycare today they should be able to tell you bits and pieces about what happened throughout the day um they should be able by by far they should be easily understood by most people around them and they should be able to tell you their fast and their last name as well um at this age they should be able to follow instructions with locations in it so put the ball in the box put the bear under the bed um put the put the blanket on the bed so really simple things that have your location where it 's like in on and under they should be able to use pronouns so you 're you i he and she and they should be able to make more sounds than what they were previously able to make so this is when your and your come in your s and her sounds in words they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time the additional bit is where if you 've got simple room rules in your games like hide and seek and tag um they will also try and do up their own buttons and put on socks by themselves and they should begin to play cooperatively with other children sometimes they might need help from um helpful but they should begin by four years the literacy skills begin um sorry i 'm just gonna move that there we go um they should continue to enjoy listening to and talking about storybooks so you know this is when they 'll probably start to pick up a storybook that they want to read at that time and they understand that they understand that the pictures and the texts in a book carry a message so every picture that is being illustrated in the book will carry a meaning of what the character is doing they should begin to identify familiar signs and labels so when you 're on the road they should be able to identify a stop sign because it 's bright and red and it 's just got four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden em golden arches they 'd be like oh mom mcdonald 's and then um or kfc or simple things like big w um kohl 's is another famous one and they should also begin to participate in rhyming games so um in the car if you want to play play a rhyming game with your child oh i see a cat what rhymes with cat and you can sort of help them with that so a few tips that you can use to help your child 's speech develop sort of between two and four years is to use simple speech that is clear so we don 't want to use anything that 's too complicated um at this age we 're still learning our basic concepts so obviously going off and using some really complicated words will you know not necessarily be that useful at this stage um so you want to build and expand even further on what your child is saying the more you do this the more they understand that they can build more words and you 're showing them how to do that grammatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see plane we could say a big plane flying so we don 't want to ask questions so much as provide statements um as to what they 're seeing um and again we need to give your child that time to respond and up to 30 seconds they are learning now from this age they 've got a lot more words in their repertoire and they 're learning now to order them correctly um so give them that time and space to do that that will be wonderful so at this age your pre-literacy skills are continuing to develop so we want to name colors shapes and objects as well as numbers in your books so you want to be choosing books that have numbers and them choose books that have shapes and you can name colors on almost every book most children 's books are deliberately made super colorful so you can name anything you 'd like um it 's not so much about the words and the books um although they will become more important sort of towards the end of the four they will start to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that they do say things but at the beginning we want to just name colors name shapes name numbers so oh how many penguins are on this page there are three penguins one two three um now we want to start expanding on what they can answer as well so asking simple who questions what questions and where care questions would be really important at this age so who went missing or what did the penguin do or where are they are really important questions now to be at the beginning of the two to four your child may have some trouble with answering these questions but that 's okay it 's just an opportunity for you to show them the correct answer or tell them the correct answer and next time they 'll know how to answer that question towards the end of the fall we expect them to be able to answer some of these questions but again this is still learning experiences of why you do it with your child they love and they learn through play we also want you to start encouraging your children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life we use that skill across the board we guess what someone else might say if we use a particular behavior we can usually predict what that behavior is going to result in sort of in reaction in someone else so if we can start doing this right now it would be really helpful for both their social skills as well as their literacy skills as well okay um by five years your child should be able to maintain a long conversation with you and this is also the stage where they ask why for pretty much everything that they see um and that 's a really good opportunity to you know model good conversation skills for your child good turn taking um waiting for someone else to finish talking before you finish um before you start talking again and you know have a conversation about pretty much whatever is happening in front of them right now they might ask you why do we have to stop at the red light have and they will be more than happy to continue a very long conversation about why you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify opposites so for example oh that 's a big tree or there 's a tall tree that is a short tree that is a big ball that is a small ball they should also begin to understand similarities between objects so for example a fork and a spoon what do they have in common we use them for eating um toothbrush and toothpaste what do they have in common we use them to brush our teeth um and they should continue to understand different location words so you 're in on under behind next to um yeah they should also continue to understand a variety of different pronouns from the ones they knew before so your his your hair and the number of sounds that they can say in words and conversations should also expand so at this age we typically see the sound come in the cha in choo choo there 's the l 's the v 's and um in your words and conversations they should also begin to use a knife and fog quite independently and have the ability to solve simple social problems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends um someone got upset because they didn 't share this toy with me they should be able to solve small conflicts like that um they should be able to tell you where they live such as their home address and tell you their age as well at um five years their literacy skills continue to develop so they should make attempts to read and write it doesn 't have to be perfect but they should show interest in wanting to hold a pencil or a crayon to write on a piece of paper and they will you know try and recognize the familiar words in books and help you read during bedtime for example they should be able to identify some letters and make some letter sound matches so for example the letter a makes the a sound the letter b makes the b sound and so on um they should begin to try and write meaningful words like their name and recognize letters in their name and phrases such as i love you so a few tips to help your child develop their speech and language at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conversation and acknowledging their efforts um particularly when they are frustrated or upset or having a really big emotion this can be really quite tricky for kids of this age because they 're not quite in control of their emotions they 're still learning so making sure you pay attention to them and helping them through these situations will be really important describing is really important and talking about objects their locations and their features is going to be really important so this is a bit more advanced than anything we 've talked about so far but particularly the location locations is a really tricky one so describing where things are located will be really important because that 's a really tricky one in english i can say i came up on the plane but i wasn 't sitting on the plane i was inside of it the words are in my book but they 're on my page so english makes that a really tricky concept for us to learn so the more you talk about that the more you will help your kids so you can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in the car let 's get in the car let 's go for a drive too we 're going to turn left here we 're turning right here discuss all of those lovely location things and um there 'll be one for your child describing an object and its features as well so describe whether it 's dirty is it old is it new um and describing what it does is going to be another really big one and that helps them develop that skill of why two things might be alike or what is an object used for um and they 'll learn almost all of that from you so encouraging your child to give directions is another one as well so it 's not about just what they understand but it 's about what they can say as well because that 's equally as important so sit back when you 're doing something with your child and say oh what should we do and give them the chance to give you the directions anyway at first it 's not going to come out perfect but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say correct it for them so if they say you know um they want you to put the block in box you can say oh red block in the box you can expand it for them and repair it for them at the same time which will help them know exactly what to say next time talking about what happened next is a really big one at this age particularly with your literacy skills so at this age your child might even be at prep by now and part of those skills at prep is they will ask them to begin telling what has happened in a story and even predicting what is going to happen next and reading between the lines as well so why do we think that might have happened even though it might not be written directly in the text so you want to encourage your child to identify some of the letters and its sounds in the book so usually those letters that they know are the ones in their name so that 's usually where they start because their name is the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters on your name and begin to expand as they grow their knowledge um if your child can read sit back and let them have a go first and just step in when they need a bit of help um and tell encourage your child to tell you what is happening in the story after you 've read it so you take that little extra bit of time depending on your child you might need to ask them to tell you after every page has ended um and some children can tell you after the entire story is done this is a really important skill so what we do in a retail is we tell something that 's happened in the past we use retail skills um in everyday life and we meet up for a coffee with our friends even as adult we 'll tell them what we did yesterday or what 's been happening lately what we plan to to do in the future and that 's how we build relationships and maintain them with our friends um being able to do a story retail is super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text and not just read it and two to be able to build those lovely communication skills to build friendships in the future um so in general we 've got a few tips that we 'd like to go back over because these ones it doesn 't matter what age your child is will be really important and if anything 's taken away today these are the ones we think would be the most important for you guys today so expanding on what your child is saying is huge it doesn 't really matter what age group it is if it is if you 've got a one-year-old who 's saying bot for bottle expanding would just look like saying the word bottle correctly for them um if you 've got a child who 's beginning to combine two words together that would look like just adding a third word um so and that would be so important no matter what age your child is that will just help them move to the next level show them what 's expected next and how they can build their language talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allows us to attach what we 're talking about to real world examples which is the quickest and easiest way to learn about our language anyone who 's learned a second language will know that that 's really important um that when you sort of have the objects in front of you you 're watching people talk about it as they do it you 'll pick up language so much faster and repeat repeat repeat is another one we cannot say enough so it might feel like you 're a bit of a broken record but the more you say something the more opportunities your child has to recognize that say if you 're cutting that word equals cutting so repeat as often as you can for your child um some general tips for social skills is playing people games so toys are important and they 're great for learning and playing and engaging with your child but you are the most important person in your child 's life the primary caregivers their siblings the people around them are the most important people so playing playing people games so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piggyback rides anything that you can do when you 're involved and there 's a turn taking so you say peekaboo then you hide and you wait and then you 'll do peek-a-boo again so it gives a chance to go back and forth even when you 're tickling you tend to tickle your child pause and wait and then tickle again and without realizing we do those back and forth things with our children to teach because it 's built into us so playing those lovely people games builds your social skills so amazingly talking about other people and how they 're feeling is really important and particularly if it 's a consequence of your own your child 's actions so if your child was to hit or bite which they all go through that stage um talking about how they made that other person feel is really important particularly if they could see that other person so if they made the other child cry it 's a really good opportunity to talk about the fact that that child is sad and they are sad because you have bitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a consequence outside of themselves and they can then build their social skills to understand later in life that when i do something i can positively or negatively impact someone else um and label your child 's feelings when they 're having a big emotion they are tiny they are little they don 't know what they 're feeling they just know that they 're having a big feeling and they can be really that doesn 't need to be just negative emotions they can be positive ones i can see you 're really happy right now you 're really excited to tell me about what happened at school today come tell me or i think you 're feeling a bit angry right now how about we take a deep breath and we can talk when you 're feeling happy again that will help your child when they feel that big emotion again they 'll start to associate that emotion with what you 're labeling it to be and that will help them grow sort of as adults and just some tips to help your child 's literacy skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as part of a routine this is such a beautiful time if you set aside you know just 20 to 30 minutes in your day to read with your child it 's a beautiful bonding experience and it also gives them the opportunity to um you know expose themselves to more books and early literacy skills at that age and when you 're reading to your child draw the edit draw their attention to print um um you know that is in the book trace your finger along um to the words in the book and that way they will know okay we start reading from the left to the right you can draw your child 's attention to print in everyday life as well so your traffic lights like um your traffic signs sorry um let 's say stop store logos like big w and woolies and coals and food jars as well so the different brands on the food jar jam for example sing songs with lots of friends and play rhyming games this will again increase the opportunity for your child to learn how to rhyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they learn how to read and write be interactive when you 're reading to them talk about the pictures in the book most children books have lots of drawings lots of images in them that carry so much meaning in those books that there 's so much to talk about even if you 're not reading those words you can talk about how the character is feeling just by looking at the face um their faces and you can talk about what the character is doing um based on what is being drawn um you can talk about what the character might be feeling as i said or what could happen next in the story so before you reach the end of the story that tells you um the conclusion or what happens right at the end you can give your child the opportunity to guess what might happen next um and this will improve their ability to predict in everyday life as well you can point to the words as in pictures as you read as i mentioned earlier and when you 're reading use a fun engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you throughout that whole process it keeps things interesting it keeps things fun feel free to um read what the character might be saying in a specific voice or if there 's a monster in a story use your monster voice if you have to encourage drawing using paper crayons finger paints this will again give your child the opportunity to build the interest into holding a pen and pencil when they learn how to write when they get to school encourage your child to describe or tell you a story or about the drawing that they just did at kinder daycare or even at home that will expand their ability to come up with a start a middle and the ending when they 're trying to tell you about their day awesome beautiful so we thought we 'd go through a few books because this is a common question we get books that you can use to grow your child 's development now all the books that we have on the screen now are currently with first five forever um these are under their little books for queensland there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous little books um and so they can be found at your local library at the moment so feel free to pop in and pick them up um and they can also be discovered downloaded on their website as well we do prefer the book form um because when they are downloaded they usually put in an ipad and ipads can lead to a bit more distraction and less learning um so the book form would be the most ideal for your child um so obvious books we 've picked out a couple that we think would be really useful for a couple of different age groups and we thought we might go through and explain why we would choose those books for those kids um so the first one here is our little alphabet book um now this one here is the little queenslanders alphabet book which is so sweet for queensland it 's got some really lovely language about the world we live in and our little location here in australia um and it goes through all of your different alphabet so even if you have a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not too many words per page um and it 's got some really wonderful and colorful pictures so you can use this one for your um your letter concepts if you 'd like to um you can also talk about different words it 's got some fun sounds in it you could count your different ants per page you could talk about why this one is a different color to these ants what are the ants doing they 're doing some pretty funny things one of them is taking a photo some of them are eating some grass but you can talk about what they 're doing um and even where they might be um and so each one of the characters is doing something really differently and different interactive things so you can go all the way from just naming the animals which would be great for your little tiny ones all the way up to describing what they 're doing how many there are and the letters um so which is why we thoroughly love that book um we 've also got this one which has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little ones that are a little bit more active um they usually love it when you use sounds like shush bang clang all of those things and this book has some amazing versions of that so you don 't even have to think of your own sounds it 's all written in there for you which is wonderful um so for example your first page has bumping and banging in it um and you guys can make those sounds be as silly as possible use as many voices but it also has lots of images and pictures and things like that for those who are a bit older as well um so this one here we thoroughly enjoy because of those fun words and look at the pictures they 're gorgeous so i think they 'd be really engaging um you know we can talk about locations this one is upside down um there are three bats what are they doing oh no this one looks like he 's stolen his mango um and we 've done all of that without reading a single word um as your children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're learning they 'll be learning to read as well and your child will usually sort of take the lead on that one they 'll start pointing towards and ask what did that say um and then you can work on that with them and the final one that we picked out of the three are these ones here um is this one here because it 's got some really good number concepts in it um the pages are relatively simple as well but still have some really gorgeous images on it so we 've got two wandering whales sing so we can talk about the fact that there 's two whales we have a big whale we have a little whale we have a mummy whale we have a baby whale so it really doesn 't matter what age your child is there 's something you can have a chat about on every page and if you 've got one with a little bit less attention span this one has less words to it but still has tons of beautiful concepts that you can communicate about the next one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adult is potato heads um and the reason why i really like this one is it it 's got your it 's got words it 's got body parts that you know we want our child to learn and be able to recognize it it 's got lots of early sounds that we want our child to be able to develop and use as well in their speech so your nose your arm for shoe shoes that 's um you know by five they should be able to say most of these sounds um i also really like potato heads because it helps your child to develop the understanding of pronouns as well so you can build a boy potato head and a girl potato head and introduce your pronouns such as you 're his hers she he um which is really really important the other some of the suggestions that we have as well is um if you 've got blocks you know you can use your color concepts um your location where so put the red block on the blue block put the yellow block under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other describing words such as oh tall tower short tower um and the other um toy choices that we also included was things that toys that can encourage pretend play so little toys that have little characters of animals or people that you can encourage your child to you know build conversations between those characters we also suggest no batteries so the toy has a battery in it um it usually then can only be used for that one particular purpose so if it 's a robot it 's just going to walk across the room there is very little pretend play opportunities for that one so something that represents real life a doll house a toy kitchen um anything like that if if it 's got batteries um it 's usually not the best toy for developing language now the key question we get is when to get help and we cannot stress enough um that early intervention is key trust your instincts as a parent as a caregiver if you feel like you 're concerned about your child 's development talk to your gp right away or book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that way if you 've got any concerns they can be addressed at the right time because getting in there early um think about like if you get in the early your work later on will be um less so you know you 've got that time to build with your child work on it as early as you can so things will flow much smoother you don 't need a referral to book an appointment either with your local speech pathologist so you can just call up and make a booking if you are all concerned um yes um so some of the frequently questions we get and that 's the ones we answer day in and day out is when is too much screen time so the current researchers say is 30 minutes a day is enough um and possibly no more than that so the main reason behind that is because there 's very little social skills and communication actually happening um when a child is buried in a tablet having said that we do understand that in today 's world being able to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require when they get to school they do actually need to know how to turn one on and do simple things so we 're not saying abandon screen time altogether but we do suggest trying to keep it to a minimum where possible um because even if it 's just allowing them to have the space and time to play with blocks by themselves they 'll learn a ton more than they would potentially using an ipad or um watching tv and things like that and the other one is who is the most important person in my child 's life and that is you if you 're sitting here watching this that 's likely because you are the primary caregiver of a small child and that would make you the most important person they will learn majority of what they learn from you beautiful so what we 're going to do is we 're going to turn it over to question time now so if you guys have already submitted questions beautiful we should be able to see them if not please feel free to hop on type any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through them now for you guys beautiful sorry just trying to find the questions okay so our first question that we 've got is what to do if your child has lazy speech so if not it isn 't usually lazy speech that your child has typically what happens is we get kids who are having trouble with certain sounds and they haven 't potentially developed as they should have so what i would suggest is simply if you are worried have a look back um the video will be available soon um and you can see whether your child sort of has fallen behind and isn 't saying certain sounds um and book an appointment with your local speech pathologist and they can help you out um where this is something we deal with day in day out helping children develop sounds that have just fallen a bit behind um we also suggest too um it never hurts to have their hearing tested so autumn if you try and book an appointment with us that 's one of the first questions we 're going to ask you is have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get that done always a great thing to test with your little ones um so i would definitely do that and book an appointment with your local speech and they can help you out the next question we got was are there any medical rebates available um either by medicare or private health so yes if you do have a medicare card you 're more than welcome to go to your gp you have to get a referral and they will give you it 's a document called team care arrangement um and you get up to five sessions um for speech pathology that will give you a 53 and 80 cents rebate from the full amount um if you do identify as indigenous you get an extra five sessions to that as well um and of course with your private health it would depend on what your level of private health covers um and it should tell you in on your policies beautiful um we 've got another little question about a toddler here that has some issues potentially with um ongoing ear infections um and it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does use his hands a lot to communicate so we do see that a lot in some children where they 'll be really good at pointing at what they want um um they 're really good at pointing at what they want they 'll be really good at um sort of gesturing they want up and all of those sort of things um but they 'll have trouble potentially using their words so um if you do have a toddler that is sort of over the age of one and hasn 't said a single word and you 've reached the age of two and they 're not even joint and they 're not joining them together i would suggest contacting a speech pathologist as soon as you can because it may be that they might need a little bit more specialized help to do that particularly this mom has popped in her thing that she looks like she is doing all the right things she 's already saying what they need um i would potentially just suggest to this mom to maybe start using single words instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example if your child isn 't saying any words then we try and get them to say say one so our example would contain just one word so if we would like them to say drink um we simply use the word drink rather than you want a drink um they 're not quite ready for that full sentence yet so just a single word would be really useful for your child um and then once they begin to use one word then we add two but if you are concerned and they are over that age book an appointment that would be really helpful for your child um the next question we received was if there was an age to stop um an amount per day that would be beneficial or otherwise for day care and language development parents nowadays you know we apparently busy lives we you know it is understandable that sometimes your child will have to go to daycare but i think at the end of the day what is most important is recognizing that you are still your your child 's ki you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pick them up from daycare talk to them use all the tips that we shared um and you know it 's a part of life really and just continue on with that absolutely even if that is that time i know often some kids get picked up quite late and then it 's rushed to dinner time and it 's things like that if you 've got a little one that 's still high chair-bound pop them in the high gym in the kitchen with you um and you guys can still be providing that communication development while they 're in the high chair with you if you talk about what you 're doing with them you 'll usually find they don 't fuss as much as well if they are sitting in the high chair and you are having a conversation with them they 'll thoroughly enjoy that um that can be as simple as around bedtime if you guys just sort of go to the bedroom 15 minutes earlier and read that extra book or do a nice quiet play activity on the floor um all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take much as long as you spend that little bit of time with your child every day you 'll find that it really helps i think that was all the questions we had yeah i think that 's all the questions for now but we will hang around for a little bit just to make sure um yeah that looks like that 's it for now um if anyone does have any other questions send them through that 's not a trouble at all [Music] sorry guys technical issues you seem to have worked it out though beautiful um so that 's all from us today thank you guys so much for tuning in i really hope that we 're able to teach you guys anything um for your children today feel free to continue sending through um questions because we will be doing this again um we 're also visiting the libraries with first fire forever as well to do um baby rhyme time and free time and story time so if you have a look on the um cancer library website you 'll be able to find us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask answer any other questions as well so um if you didn 't get to or you didn 't have a chance to submit your question today please do come and find us we 're more than happy to have a chat sounds good beautiful we really like to thank you all for listening and hope that everyone has a safe and lovely christmas and hopefully a very good break as well [Music] you,"(-16.9203476, 145.7709529)"

AUS,QLD,Cairns Regional Council,Cairns Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/user/CouncilCairns,Author talk with Jen & Ryan Tate,M4L8fnfCMwE,20210712,3614.16,"Cairns City QLD 4870, Australia",11652,[Music] g 'day everyone hello i 'm ryan and i 'm jen and we are here today to present uh all things dog training in light of our newly released book titled how to train your dog so before we get started we thought we 'd do a little bit of an introduction about who are we in our animal training journey and why we might be able to help you with your dogs or your neighbor 's dogs or dogs in general so uh i started training animals when i was about 10 or 11 years old with birds actually so uh that was my first passion was working with birds and then led to fish i then became a marine biologist and worked at toronto zoo training marine mammals and all different aquatic creatures and throughout that journey i was dabbling with dog training entering into agility and obedience trials and as time went on my love for all things marine start to be overtaken by dogs and during that journey i met jenny and we started our own dog training business and um yeah over to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah well i i started helping out in vets um i obviously knew early on that i wanted to do something with animals that also led me to uh work at toronto zoo and some other zoos in sydney uh meet ryan and then then we started our dog training career and passion from there yeah together so for probably the last uh six years all we 've done virtually exclusively is train dogs we still do our zoo consults and work with aquariums for short and specific projects around maybe particular animals learning particular tasks but we have at our home now we have seven dogs here at the moment that are all in some way shape or form working dogs in the sense that finn our little shetland sheepdog he helps reactive and aggressive dogs overcome their fear of dogs and he also works in what we call the cyanophobia clinic which is a clinic for people who have fear of dogs and uh finn also works with our belgian malinois rapha who 's on the cover of the book this handsome stud right here uh in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of scary looking dog and ralph 's also a biosecurity dog and the rest of our dogs all different beautiful wonderful uh springer and cocker spaniels all work in working roles as either biosecurity or what we would call conservation dogs so dogs that are finding animals and plants that are either really worth conserving that might be critically endangered or a threatened species and then on the flip side of that also finding new incursions into our country of plants that shouldn 't be here or maybe animals that are getting onto islands or different parts of the country that we don 't want them such as cane toads rats mice and other invasives as well so all of our dogs are very much part of the family but like us they work and we all get to work together almost every day which is lovely yeah i think um the coolest thing about working with dogs and about our business since we 've branched away from the zoo is that we have managed to diverse uh dog training business into so many different facets from the cynophobia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioning to pet dog work film and television i don 't know i 'm sure there 's more and i can 't think of it um so they really are the most incredible animal to work with and every single dog that we work with whether it 's um a whether it 's our dogs or a consultation that we go to we learn new things every single time um we 've got a lot of stories about the dogs we 've worked with in our book um and i think they 've grown us as dog trainers over the years to be uh the trainers we are today and one thing that we do today one thing that we do with our dogs that we really learnt through the zoo industry which has inspired the book is to treat them all as individuals and do the best thing you can do is to try and work out what makes your dog tick understand their genetics understand their ailments their physical abilities and what they really like and what really motivates them and that 's what we always did with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we really try and uh encourage and inspire people to do through the book is figure out ways to really work out what makes their dog tick and what is going to bring them to being a happy dog so today the you know the overarching theme of our presentation is going to be about how do you make your dog happy a happy dog is easy to live with that 's fulfilled it is you know not just obedient but willing and wanting to do what it can to work with you and be happy as being compliant around the house or on the street or off lead and we 're gonna show you a little um slide in a moment that we call the happy dog pyramid and we base everything more or less starting at the bottom the the heaviest weight of what is going to impact your dog 's ability to be happy is their genetics and health now everything else on this list depending on your dog and your household and your lifestyle they are they are transferable so you don 't necessarily need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health will absolutely underpin everything you cannot train or you shouldn 't really be training a dog that is unwell so we always say to people if you 're having a problem with your dog if you suspect something is making your dog aggressive or anxious or upset we do like you to first and foremost go and see your vet make sure that your dog doesn 't have teeth issues joint issues breathing difficulties especially if that that sun changing that behavior change is sudden and not over a period of time yeah so we very much like to work in conjunction with vets we 've got a lot of clinics around new south wales that we work very closely with and um yeah you know we pay tribute to a lot of the vets that will um really beautifully be able to fix something that creates an underlying behavioral issue yep so this sorry this pyramid here whether you 've tuned in because you 're about to get a new puppy or you you 've got your new newest family member or you have an older dog with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the above so for setting your puppy up for success long term in in their behavior or if you have a dog that has all of a sudden um you know has a behavioral issue that is undesirable and you 're trying to fix then go back to this these steps and stages to try to reach that happy dog goal down the end so what we 're going to do over the next hour is sort of go through these stages and explain what they 're about and how to implement them uh generally yeah uh to cover hopefully most of um to help most of the people who have joined in if you have a question at any stage send it through and we 'll answer it as we 've got yeah so uh when we talk about genetics there 's a couple of different ways that we would like you to consider the genetics of your dog so first and foremost we want you to be aware that there are different dog groups so there 's registered there 's seven different registered dog groups in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of crossbreeds and popular you know oodle varieties and common breeds that will cross over but these different registered dog groups in australia which you know have about 400 breeds within them were mostly originally bred for a a physical purpose so whether it be something like the cavalier spaniel that was bred to be on the lapse of royalty and keep them warm or whether it be a dog like a mastiff or a shepherd that you know primary function was to form some type of guarding instinct they all have physical abilities and emotional and behavioral traits they were bred for for literally hundreds and hundreds of years so in the case of the spaniels that you can see i 'm running through the bushfires there or up sally with a tennis ball spaniels have been bred for 700 years to find things with their nose to find things that aren 't moving around not track them but actually find them through the air which is why we use them for detection work and understanding what makes that breed what it is particularly from a behavioral perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can expect the dog to be triggered by what makes the dog happy what makes it feel fulfilled and good and warm inside and you can tailor your training to suit that dog as an individual now we acknowledge that there 's going to be lots of cross breeds and variations and you might get a dog from the pound you might have a a few spare bucks your genetic test you might find out that the dog has seven different breeds from all different groups within it and you can just utilize that to to just give yourself all right well i could be expecting anything here or you might get a dog that is predominantly terrier now the terrier variety of dogs we know to be generally very wanting to bond to people they want to be around people a lot and if they don 't have that time and that ability to be part of the family terriers more than any other dog will really fret and will get really anxious now on the flip side of that terriers the name is terrier meaning the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth so if you 're anywhere in australia at the moment where we 're experiencing a mouse or a rat plague your dog with a bit of terrier in it is going to be having the best time of life chasing rats around if you get a dog and you find out that it 's a terrier and you have guinea pigs in your backyard or chooks perhaps maybe not so much trucks as much as say small moving mammals but terriers have a higher desire to chase small moving animals very interesting very instinctive absolutely it 's not something they need to be trained to do they just want to do it it 's not being a bad dog it 's not aggressive or anything like that that 's they 're just working off their genetics and as long as you know that hey i 've got a terrier it needs a lot of time connecting with the family and it has a high desire to chase and grab things that moves through the ground you can play games with toys and tennis balls and flirt poles that simulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of you know rousing on them every time they want to chase a possum and that is what we 'll talk about in the outlet section of the pyramid further up um and this is why understanding this side of it the genetics will help you then determine that outlets section a little bit more you 've got the working dogs too and i reckon 90 of the behavior behavioral consultations that we visit with a working dog breed we 're dealing with reactive behaviors or tendencies to um moving objects so for those of you that don 't know what reactive is as well it 's a very common used term within our industry but it 's just not necessarily aggressive it 's just a dog that when it sees a particular stimulus it 's barking it 's lunging it 's hitting the end of the lead and it 's usually deemed as something undesirable but a a good working dog a good kilby a good border collie as a young dog when it sees moving objects it should lunge it should bark and it should go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach them hey we don 't want you to lunge and round up and chase cars and bikes but you can do that with maybe sheep or cattle or tennis balls or um any variety of toys so you 've got that slide in front of you you can see the seven different dog groups if you have your own dog google it they are called the a and k c dog groups and you can learn more about them and uh there 's huge descriptions within our book of those different dog groups and exercises that are going to make that dog feel really good so start there make sure your dog is physically healthy understand its genetics and you are already really having the foundations to making a happy obedient thought going on to safety management safety management uh this this is i think this is huge this particular section i think when anyone especially i deal more with puppy development uh puppy schools etc and people um who need help raising uh the puff from the beginning um and management is huge in preventing undesirable behavior from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do everything in our house prior to bringing a puppy home to set them up for success so you know in puppy school i hear questions all the time about how do i stop my dog doing xyz how do i how do i make my dog not do this or how do i fix this problem and it 's probably the most annoying thing is to say prevent it from happening um but that means through things like puppy pens and um and leads and all that all the above we actually uh our last puppy that we raised we built it probably cost us about 400 but we built a contained area on the end of our deck uh that allowed our puppy the space to be outside to be with us but they couldn 't be chasing the kids around the garden um she couldn 't all the chips she couldn 't go over to the fence line where there were other two labradors and practice running and barking up and down the fence line uh so yeah management has a really big part and obviously we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foremost whenever we bring a new dog home we assume that that dog isn 't bonded with us yet and it might have a high desire to escape from the property so as well as setting up the area um to prevent the dog from say chasing other animals and children we also want to make sure that dog is less likely to escape from our property once a new dog escapes and runs off away from your property you can have a really difficult time in getting that dog back because it 's not bonded with you and you can also potentially have the dog learn a you know a repertoire or a behavior that they will practice later in life when they 're stressed so the way our property is set up most of the time most of the dogs could escape if they wanted to these are all highly agile working dogs who at work will regularly have to jump over things that are six foot high or onto things six foot high maybe with a bit of help or something to spring off but yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they don 't escape and that 's because they are fulfilled but we also have areas like the the deck and like another a dog run that we have where when the dogs are just getting used to the property there 's no physical way they can escape we will not let that happen they 'll either be under supervision they 'll be on lead or they 'll be in an area where escape isn 't possible until that dog feels good feels safe likes the other dogs here likes us knows how to come when they 're called and then we can say right now you 've got more freedom we know that you 'll be safe in our yard now because you 're a contempt dog the other thing about that i think too is making sure they 're contained and they 're safe is that when you bring home a puppy for the first time or potentially a rescue an older dog that 's a rescue um we as human beings feel the need to want to give them everything and and all this space but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new environment it 's actually far more uh beneficial for the their emotional development to be contained to a smaller area and get used to that area and feel confident in that area before giving them access to an enormous backyard or or taking a rescue dog within the first few weeks to a dog park um so that that need for freedom for the dogs perspective isn 't necessarily the best thing for them now the bottom of this pyramid the safety management and the next step up socialization environmental conditioning uh is all is deemed most is more important i think it all works together um but it 's it 's really important in helping the dog 's emotional state first is raising that dog that is resilient it it feels confident it 's uh what 's independence and independence comes into safety and management too is we 're trying to uh things like crate training and puppy pins to slowly build our dog 's resilience to being left alone long term in the backyard by themselves down the track so the other thing is uh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog is kept when they 're not supervised uh one of the things i really really want everyone to keep in mind particularly for those of you that have dogs that are displaying some form of aggressive or super undesirable behavior is when you leave them alone they cannot be in a location where they can see their triggers and see the things that set them off the worst thing you can do for an anxious or aggressive dog or a dog that is just generally what would say reactive or a vulnerable puppy or a vulnerable puppy yeah the worst thing you can do is leave them in a pen where they are frequently seeing things like dogs and people and cars going past them and that is making them either scared or making them bark or making them chase if i 'm the best dog trainer in the world and i 'm going to fix your dog from chasing people or cars or dogs i cannot fix a dog by being there and training it for an hour or two or three or four hours a day one-on-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're unsupervised so if any of you if your dog is doing something undesirable go out to bunnings or mitre 10 or your local hardware store and get some shade cloth or get some new fencing and separate sections of your yard or maybe consider bringing them inside more often a lot of dogs eats karma if they 're actually allowed into the house and you 'd be surprised how long a mature male dog will go holding its blood if it 's allowed inside the house so consider how you manage them and where you leave them when they 're unsupervised as probably the most effective and important part of training your dog to not chase not bark not be anxious instead of going well how can i get a train around here to stop that let 's prevent that before we talk about stopping that behavior or training them something else yeah so uh we 're not going to go into it but uh we are advocates for crate training um it will take us forever to go through why but the book really explains it so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book and understanding all the all the benefits and all the right ways to do it obviously that 's the wrong way to create brand new as well um and yeah that is a big part of the building block later on we see a lot of older dogs that have behavioral issues that we then have to look at potentially crate training to help help them down the track it 's a lot harder with an older dog right so moving on to socialization and environmental conditioning now before we go any further we really need to stress that socialization is appropriately socializing or exposing your dog to other living creatures it isn 't just about socializing your dog with dogs and the emphasis i should say is on appropriately socializing it is not appropriate to take a puppy to an offline dog park full stop period ever no one will ever change my mind on that there is a whole host of reasons why it is not appropriate to take a puppy to a off-leap dog park number one for those of you in north queensland or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases such as parvo virus and distemper that puppies aren 't fully vaccinated against but following that the number one killer of dogs in australia is dogs being put down due to behavioral reasons behavioral problems can be developed or almost always are developed during the first 16 weeks of your dog 's life and usually because of unpleasant or inappropriate experiences so a 8 to 16 week old puppy that goes to a dog park and either practices chasing dogs a lot or getting chased by dogs and harassed by dogs a lot will almost certainly i guarantee you will be a problem adult dog you won 't see the problems for the next six or even 12 months but when that dog matures a puppy that has been at a busy dog park every day will almost certainly obsess over dogs in a positive way that makes the dog very difficult to recall and be bonded with the owner or become fearful of dogs and then become aggressive so socialization needs to be done with the idea of my puppy needs to see dogs and smell dogs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them there 's no in socialization particularly with breeds that have labrador a very high desire to socialize or herd or predate most breeds right they really don 't need to practice high arousal rumbling and playing with other dogs with unknown dogs yeah yeah yeah for all dogs to have their known doggy friends but when you 're raising a puppy from a young age you want you and your family to be the most socially exciting and important thing in their world they are social beings yes but they don 't need that play to come always from other dogs especially unknown dogs so choose a couple of known doggy friends and slowly integrate them together through on lead walks through maybe a playdate in your back garden and when you do do those play dates we talk about doing the cafe dog exercise as well so this means um and this comes under management in our book as well uh but this means letting them have a little bit of a play but then also teaching your puppy a very important lesson of being able to relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well yeah for sure and that uh idea of being calm in the presence of other dogs will not occur if every time your puppy sees a dog you allow them to play together so the best thing you can do for your puppy or even your adult dog that you 've just acquired is usually you teach them that we don 't need to meet every dog you can walk past them it can be a positive experience without meeting dog you can every time your dog looks at another dog you can say good boy now let 's heal and keep walking and your dog can still go well that was nice i got told i 'm a good dog but we also moved on and we didn 't meet the other dog that 's right we have a 10 week old puppy at the moment that we 're raising and every day we 're going out actually this brings me to the next point is we we also live in an area where there has been active cases of parvo virus but this will not stop us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so important especially if you live in a built up town or city like sydney or brisbane or where are we cans and if we keep our puppy for the entire critical period which unfortunately is the entire length until that dog is fully vaccinated if we keep them home in our lounge room that whole time their brain is absorbing the lounge room as comfortable as familiar and as their world so when it comes to 16 weeks if you clip a lead on that puppy and take them for a walk along the promenade you 're going to have a very very nervous puppy on your hands that spent that whole time in their lounge room so as like ryan said at the beginning socialization isn 't about one-on-one dog dr dog socialization experiences it 's about getting them out and getting them exposed to everything you 're going to expect that puppy to cope with and be happy around as an adult yeah and one of the topics or ways that we describe socialization and environmental conditioning is we want our dogs to view most things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some examples of environmental conditioning is talking about the environment around the dogs and mechanical things and structures i want all of my dogs to view this is my working dogs for example i want them to view cars motorbikes people other dogs and birds chickens forklifts as neutral it 's not scary it 's not nice it 's just neutral it 's like furniture in our house it 's not something that we particularly have a high attachment to but it can exist in our environment just as something that is present but what i want to be positive is me i want the dog to think i 'm fantastic so when we 're in that mutual environment if i ask them to come to sit to find or to do a behavior i 'm comparatively the most positive thing in that environment and then i can use my food treats i can use tennis balls i can use toys that i 've also made very positive for my dogs to work on other things all right so when you 're looking at raising your dog or training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog a bit scared of the lawnmower or is my dog obsessed with the lawn mower and chasing it around how do i bring it back to being more neutral so you know if the dog loves chasing a lawn mower you might want to start tying the dog up while you mow the lawn and mow the lawn at a distance if your dog is fearful of it you might want to introduce the dog to the lawnmower while it 's off and give it some treats and we try and work that pendulum till we get our dog back to a neutral state of going well the lawnmower is just okay i 'd rather be chasing a ball or chewing on a bone while you mow the lawns anyway so view it as environmental conditioning and socialization just making your dog very comfortable with the world around them and then you can have a dog that you can make swimming positive running with you super positive playing fetch uh training and just being engaged with their owner as more positive and everything else in the world is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two parts the the training and the outlets are really important what we 're trying to do now is get our puppy feeling comfortable and confident with everything in life so nothing is scary or overwhelming and then once we 've got that confident dog they are so easy and so willing to train and then we want to make them think that we are the world if we 're doing a dog 's day out presentation we bring our dogs along um we 've got to make sure that they they want to work with us they don 't want to go and say hello to every other person or steal the dog 's bone over there or chase after the dogs over there so um yeah it 's it 's it 's a period uh in the early days of really making the dogs feel comfortable yeah and and building resilience there 's going to be times where you 're taking your older dog out or your puppy and they find or see something that is scary um and how you deal with that scary moment will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear towards it as well yeah now one of the things that um happens you know we 'd like to have happen during our any of our dogs lives but particularly early on is that they get exposed to a thunderstorm now jen and i or jen in particular will usually think of these topics as for puppies and young dogs but this does apply to adult dogs and older dogs as well it 's just that what you do with a puppy has the capacity to to prevent or even create lifelong issues whereas if you only start tackling things like thunderstorms with the dog as an adult um it can slip back into old habits so let 's say if i have a puppy and it 's oh i do have a puppy and she 's 10 weeks old we 're gonna get some wild weather this afternoon i know for a fact that uh her line of dogs her lineage of dogs can be a little bit sensitive to storms they 're not full blown storm phobic but they can get a bit sensitive they can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever there 's wild weather so with this puppy when the storm kicks off either this afternoon or tomorrow morning i 'll probably take her outside and play fetch and play with a tug with her because i know that 's her favorite things to do and what i 'm doing is i 'm making the storm a bit positive i 'm making storms fun by association with the games that i 'm playing now if she freaks out during the storm when we 're going to be a big clap of thunder and she runs to me for a bit of you know support i 'll give her support okay i 'm not going to be hard on the dog i 'm not going to say oh you know harden up and deal with it i will give the dog a little bit of support but it 'll be light-hearted it 'll be loose but oh it 's okay i 'll talk to the dog i 'll say to the dog what i would feel and let the dog realize that well it 's okay to come and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big deal it 's not something we worry about so the other things that people do during storms or during any sort of event that might make dogs fearful like fireworks is they either ignore the dog completely when the dog needs some encouragement or they go overboard and this is the thing that gives encouragement a bad name or gives reassurance a bad name where a lot of dog trainers will say no don 't give well i shouldn 't say a lot of dog trainers but some dog trainers will say no don 't give the dog any affection or encouragement when they 're scared because you 'll reinforce the fear that 's only if you encourage them like a baby so for example if i have a dog that 's scared of a thunderstorm and i go oh it 's okay it 's okay and i get down low on the ground and i 'm talking in a manner and behaving in a manner that is akin to me being scared i am confirming to the dog i 'm also scared so you should be scared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog is getting more scared as we 're pretending to be scared during the thunderstorm what we should do is be confident and be happy with the dog so it 's in the middle it 's i see it with my my kids if they fall over and hurt their knee um how i respond to that situation can determine their ongoing emotional state so if i just completely ignore they get more upset uh if i go oh my gosh that must hurt so much and carry on like crazy then they 're going to get more upset but if i actually go are you okay give me a cuddle let 's put a band-aid on it you know and keep it calm and i reassure them you end up with a kid that a minute later is like cool i 've got a cool banjo on my leg i 'm fine now so yes it is um they are they are you 're dealing with socially intelligent emotional creatures that really need that that emotional support early on in the relationship to to create that stable dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there anything else in socialization it 's a topic we could probably talk about for an hour but um middle ground there 's a balance we talked about it as a seesaw in the book you know you can go way to one end or you could go way too much down the other end and not take your puppy out at all or your other dog but if you can kind of get it in the middle a little bit and make things neutral and maybe a little bit boring and then i don 't care about it then you 're you 're winning yeah and um a the next step up is obedience but uh as most dog trainers will tell you it 's very difficult to make a dog obedient if it is either scared or obsessive over the things that are around them so that 's why socialization and environmental conditioning as an underpinning topic which can be done in conjunction with obedience but that whole concept underpins it so you know to train a dog to be you know to walk on a loose lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessed with them is really really tricky and that 's why we want to get that that topic right and get that you know particularly to have a puppy is balance it out one of the things that we used to see a lot in people with um staffies back in sort of the early 2000s when there was a couple of incidents with stuffies in sydney where they 're getting a bit of a bad rappers potentially being aggressive dogs and they will say oh no i 'm going to take him to the dog park every day i want to socialize him and then we 'd end up with staffies that are over social too rough and too full-on with dogs which again sort of starts to look a bit aggressive um so it 's about really finding that middle ground and knowing your dog and saying well you know i have a german shepherd the belgian malinois and they are notoriously assertive and strong and intimidating looking dogs the chances of most dogs loving my malinois are zero he 's a scary looking dog so i teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other dogs if they bark to check in with me if they give him a hard time that his job is just just to ignore them please ignore them 99.9 of time i want him to ignore other dogs and that 's because i know the breed is a certainty for strong and scary and other dogs are going to take offense just to his face he just got one of those heads that other dogs want to punch in so um it 's about understanding the dog and saying what level of socialization should i allow and should i expect and what kind of response is ideal from my dog there are some dog groups that are more tolerant and more social particularly our hounds like our beagles and then the gun dogs as well which are naturally more social and more tolerant particularly of each other but that doesn 't mean a kelpie is going to enjoy the advances of a labrador or a golden retriever or a a beagle but you know you put a bunch of beagles together a bunch of spaniels together a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty crazy this is actually where dog parks can go wrong because you 've got so many different breeds all vying for the same kind of uh attention or you know having the same experience in a dog park where you 've got the working dogs like the kelpies and the cattle dogs that just want to be there with their owner chasing their ball and they actually don 't care about the rest of the world or you 've got the kelpies that maybe are trying to round up all the other dogs and then you 've got the you know overzealous crazy labrador a bit obnoxious that i can say that we 've got one um that just wants to run up to every dog so when you 've got those two breeds meeting in the middle it can sometimes not go well and you know it unfortunately it 'll be the kelpie that turns around and um and snips the lab and looks like the aggressor when really the labrador probably shouldn 't have run over to the kelp to begin with so anyway we could we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should just digress and say that dog parks or dog exercise areas can be good and we 've worked on the design of some and the unveiling of some they can be good and we know of a couple in new south wales if the emphasis is on dog and owner exercise and engagement and obedience and that everyone the community follows the rules they 're not splitting their dogs their dogs aren 't there to play with each other their dogs are there to do exercises with the owner in the presence of other dogs there was that study done on eighteen hundred dogs i think it was in the dog park environment where they tested the cortisol of the dogs oh yeah before the saliva before they ended stretch the stress levels sorry and 20 minutes later and um i can 't remember the stats but a huge portion of them actually weren 't enjoying themselves at the park even though their owners thought they were so um interesting we should find that in um page but yes we could go on forever and we we are stereotypic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of them do fall into these categories we do have a sister-in-law that has a kelpie and it 's a couch potato but you know nine out of ten kelpies are not going to be awake um so yes anyway obedience obedience there is a couple of things that uh every dog in australia must learn first one is come when called okay we say that from the beginning when we ask our dogs to come we set them up for success and we make sure that every single time they come it 's christmas and disneyland all at once they get rewards they get an emotional connection and they get the ability to go free yep when we 're training our dogs to come we want them to think i come i get praised i get rewarded and i get to go back to doing whatever i was doing now that last bit is so critical because usually when you want your dog to come it 's because there 's a problem right and if your dog thinks every time i come there 's a problem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what i was into before you have a dog that goes i 'm chasing for example a chicken when mum asks me to come i get a single piece of chicken and then i get clipped on lead the dog will perform an equation after a few repetitions the dog will go i have a whole chook you have one piece i 'm going to stay with the whole trip but if we practice games with our dogs so we say come away from play with someone else and you 'll get a treat and get to go back to play the dog reliably thinks that when i 'm asked to come no matter what i 'm chasing i usually get to go back to it i usually get to go back to the ball back to my friend back to another family member so when you do ask a dog to come away from the chicken or the kangaroo the dog goes great i 'll come i 'll get a treat in a moment you 're probably going to let me to go back and chase the chalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase at that one out of ten times providing you 're practicing recalls lots of other times your dog won 't hold that against you the dog will go okay one time i didn 't get to go free i still got a treat but i still got praise and usually i get to go free so the message is practice getting your dog to come practice rewarding it practice praising it and do it in an environment where you can let your dog go free after they 've come which is generally not when back to chasing a chicken no don 't go backwards no i should go to the outside because you just said it before um in that context but no yes yeah we want you to practice it in locations where the dog isn 't doing something wrong so when you do need it yes you can actually haul them away and and protect them from or protect the chicken from your dog um we 'll do things like slowly build them up to being able to call them away from their dinner for sure get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ryan might be playing with the puppy on the ground and then i say come and the puppy comes away gets a treat and then i encourage the puppy back to playing with ryan on the ground so they 're the sorts of situations we 're talking about with the company but if there is a hundred steps you know you have not fully trained a bomb proof recall until you are at step 100 which is potentially six months down the track yeah for sure we say your recall isn 't perfect unless you can call your dog away from a whole barbecue chicken from other dogs playing from people playing with toys and uh there 's something else maybe of that together well yeah all of that together if your dog can 't do all those things you don 't have a perfect recall no so you shouldn 't be letting your dog off lead at the beach or um off-lead at a park if you think it 's gonna raid someone 's picnic people all people have a right to be in every council parkland doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground at a park that happens to be an off-lead exercise area or a beach and have a picnic on the ground without your dog invading their space and that that is a fact your dog can be labeled a nuisance dog or a menacing dog if it charges into someone 's picnic and causes chaos so for your dog um train it to recall away from food training to recall away from social interactions let 's say that the dog doesn 't have a good recall and you 're wanting to train a good radical then you can again use this pyramid to to go back to basics again so working out what genetics if you 've got a husky it 's going to take a lot longer than if you 've got a um why is that though explain why it 's harder to train because huskies are trained to push on to move away to drive further so they are and i 'd say beagles are probably the same yeah yeah some of the harder breeds to train a recall so not impossible but they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 've got a husky uh and genetics will tell you you 're going to have a lot of a lot more harder a longer yeah time then management put a long lead on the dog if you 're not sure 100 of the time that they are going to come when you call them you want to add a long line to help you succeed a long line is just a a dog lead that might extend or not extend 20 meters at 20 meters of long of a lead or a 10 meter or even a 5 meter lead that enables you to have the dog feel free and explore more but be still connected to you or you have you know an extra bit of dog to grab because you might dogs we get it we get the question a lot my dog 's perfect at home will recall all the time but if i 'm at a dog park or from out and about it goes out the window and that 's because you 've stepped from level one to level 100 um in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway obedience the other the other most important uh is is stay okay so we teach our dogs a sit and stay as usually sort of step one of training is implied sit and stay so if in doubt we want our dogs to always sit and stay when you get to a door probably a good idea to sit and stay when you get to a gate it 's probably a good idea to sit and stay unless you 're invited out or invited in when you get to the edge of a road stop sit and stay and await further instruction so that we just it 's just repetitions it 's just it 's just building it into the dog and we honestly we don 't say a lot we have the door the gate or the road be the cue or be the command when you get to the front door i 'm gonna make you sit and stay for a moment until i say free or come or outside and the dogs just learn that in these locations they 're very good contextual learners in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stop for a moment so just offer it up autonomously i think an important thing to realize um at this point in the pyramid and with the sit is that dogs perceive far more than just the treat in your hand as being reinforcing so it might be going outside is what makes them feel good so if they 're jumping up on the door before you open it you have um you 've trained them to jump to go outdoors you know so think of all the things that your dog might perceive as being reinforcing or rewarding uh and um make sure that the awful paws are on the ground prior to that happening it might be meeting meeting other people meeting people um i think i 've lost everything coming out of cargo if you know um it 's freedom yeah freedom yeah as well as treats as well as praise and cuddles and affection yeah so the uh and then final and most obvious thing which um you know we 're not even going to tell you how to do it because this is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local dog trainer or a dog club particularly in cairns you 've got some really good dog clubs around there and that is uh walking on leave yeah okay it is there 's an entire chapter on yeah yeah one whole channel complex just for that and even in that we say you should probably still seek out a good dog trainer to help you with loosely walking but at the end of the day if you have a dog that walks on a nice loose lead that comes when cold and can stay that 's pretty much the dream for most pet dog owners that have a difficult dog they would just want those three things and be really really happy with their dogs so if you just chip away at that those three things with your dog and maybe you know get the book or engage with them a local dog trainer um you 'd be amazed at how far you can go just looking at those three obedience exercises on their own yeah we 've we cover about i don 't know eight to ten different things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of other things i guess that comes into outlets um as well and it 's great to continue your draining training journey but master those basics first um okay because we 're running out of time outlets is probably i think one of the most important things in completing the pyramid and this is your absolute well it 's it 's my favorite topic now me too in puppy school now actually it 's become a much bigger part of our puppy school because i think it it develops a really strong bond with you as the owner it develops an outlet for the dog depending on what their genetics are let 's explain what outlets are our outlets are just exercises and activities that you choose and you enable your dog to do based upon their personality and their genetics that just make them feel good that 's all it is things that make them feel good jen and i as humans have different activities that we do and we acknowledge that we need to do on a regular basis to feel normal and to function and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get in the ocean two three times a week i have to otherwise i don 't work well i 'm not crazy to leave yeah well i 'm not productive jen needs to get out in the garden and just you know plant trees prune water rake and jen just likes being in amongst nature and connecting with nature a couple of times a week or if not every day just for a little bit just to decompress so dogs never said dogs need the same they need to sniff they need to run they might need to swim use their brains some people love to play chess and do sudoku if you ever bought a collie think of that as a dog that likes to do sudoku while running marathons right they they have every dog has things that make them feel good that would be a crime not to let them practice so again in the book we have a whole chapter on outlets on things you can do with your dog to make them feel good but we would suggest that everyone should with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose it 's how they see the world get them to find their treats find a ball find you find the kids find your money find you drugs uh whatever you want them to do don 't get them to find drugs unless you 're a police officer but get your dog to use their nose in some way shape or form is the best most underrated outlet that you can do the easiest one is just scatter feeding their food in the backyard or putting their food in a cold and they have you know all that little stuff helps towards um the food but outlets is i mean people think when they 've got a puppy with a dog sorry the two main forms of exercise i reckon would be uh running free to dog park or ball chucker yeah constant back and forth um fetch and both of those don 't actually um allow that dog to use its brain as well so a lot of the outlets that we 're going to talk about very quickly because we 're running out of time and questions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the brain and and using some sort of impulse control combined with the physical activity it 's not a mindless just running task it 's a task with purpose and with some rules and maybe an end goal that just make that dog feel incredibly satisfied by the end of the day so that all those things together lead to the tip of the pyramid which which is a happy top now we 've got a couple of questions coming through that we 're going to hit and if you have any you know you can punch them in now and we 'll do our best to get to them um the the first one that we 're seeing here now from helen is about how to keep other dogs away from her sausage dog when she 's at the beach she keeps on leave but other people with other dogs think she 's cute um and she ends up you know it ends up being a stressful environment look there 's a couple of things you can do helen if it 's an off lead if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i would honestly just say don 't take your dog there unfortunately um if your dog is finding it stressful and you know that there 's going to be other offline dogs there it 's not the right thing to do if it is an on lead area um what i do if i 'm walking or working with a dog that is fearful or reactive um there 's two things that i usually do and i have um some big great danes i was super aggressive i was working with for a while whenever i walked with those dogs i must have had a look on my face that said don 't talk to me all right because um i would rarely get people come up and try and engage with me all these results beautiful looking dogs but we 're aggressive they want to come and pat them but i would also if someone approached i 'd put my hand up shut up and say stop don 't approach the dog get your dog under control do not approach and i 'd keep advocate and i advocate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say he 's not friendly she 's not friendly because they go it 's okay my dog 's friendly or i don 't say he doesn 't like people it 's okay i 'm great with dogs i do not give the other people an opportunity to debate or discuss the topic with me it 's unfortunately you have to be a little bit rude but i would say stop do not approach get your dog under control do not approach and i would move on the other thing i do though i take a slip lead with me everywhere i go that is a small lead that can open up in a in a noose and if i get an off-lead dog in an area where a dog is meant to be on lead particularly if i 'm working with someone else 's dog i 'll catch the off-leg dog that 's not something a lot of people would feel comfortable doing but it is something i do because i 'm i 'm often handling aggressive dogs and for the safety of the off-lead dog if i catch it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog or by the dianabog whatever it is that i have so i do it out of courtesy and safety for the oncoming dog just to catch it and to have it under control and then maybe i can look at the collar and call the person honestly i catch off lead dogs all the time and i take them home to the owners mistakes happen people don 't mean to have those dogs approaching me but usually i can loop my lead of the dog that i 'm walking around something secure and i can catch the off-lead dog check the mobile phone number and call the owner and say hey i 've caught your dog the other thing that you can do is there 's uh is company friendly dog collars oh yes yes friendly dog collars which have all different leads all different colors yellow is generally the color for a timid or nervous puppy or dog and it has nervous stale you know stay away or give room yeah yeah and you can also now buy t-shirts that say keep back my dog 's yeah yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know so there 's lots of different things out there that that you can do um i hope that helps helen it 's a it 's a difficult one and it 's frustrating when you 're doing the right thing um we 're about to get a puppy in a few weeks thinking of crate training however our two older rescue dogs just sleep in our bedroom with us what can one of you well sorry what would your suggestions for the puppy be if you 've got two rooms i 'd suggest if there 's two of you i think it sounds like there 's two of you maybe not well no there 's two so this is from ashley so she 's got two older rescue dogs that sleep in the bedroom and a new puppy yes but i 'm saying if there 's two humans in the household which i believe we are about to get a poppy anyway if there 's two of you i 'd suggest one of you sleep in a spare room if you have one that 's what we do yeah usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when we get a puppy usually yeah one of us will sleep in a spare room or in the lounge room with a puppy if you 've got two dogs that already have a particular routine sleep in your room then you don 't have to upset them and introduce puppies so i would be dividing and conquering in that particular i mean actually as well you can gradually start to introduce crate training for the adult dogs as well and there 's no reason why you can 't have dogs crated in your bedroom we um our old aussie shepherd used to he was raised crate trained and then as he became a diabetes adult dog we just never did it and he slept wherever he wanted um but then when we had our first child come home um he got stepped on by accident at night in the bedroom as we 're tending to the crying baby he got a bit stressed when the baby would cry and he 'd try and follow us around as we were soothing the bug and the dog didn 't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably four or something at that age we reintroduced the crate and just like you know it only took him a day or two but he was so much happier and that that association all that connection to lennox being you know every time he would cry during the day ahri would prior to creating would be whimpering and carrying on as soon as we created him and that that problem at night stopped he was much happier yeah so don 't don 't um don 't think it is a bad thing for your adult dogs we really view the crate as something that 's comfortable that is den like and is a an environment where the dog associates it with being calm yeah jen created a beautiful analogy where our bedrooms for humans are associated with being calm and going to sleep and that helps program our brain to go there and to be calm and to fall into a deeper slumber more quickly we can do the same with the dogs in their crates make it comfortable associated with sleep and your dog can actually get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best way to stop puppy nipping and biting the kids uh look this is one we can absolutely talk about because we 've got two one year old a six year old and a ten week old puppy uh and the best way is management it 's that annoying thing where we always come back to management but we 've got a puppy pen in the house we 've got a crate in the house we 've got a puppy pen outside the house um a crate outside the house so and we spend the first few weeks of that puppy 's life working almost solely on developing an independence and happiness in that puppy being in those spaces so when the nipping and biting starts and becomes worse we can comfortably and confidently pop them in these spaces with a bit of enrichment and they 're not going to pry the house down so if you haven 't done that and the binding 's already started just try to work a little bit on the crating and the puppy pens as being a great place not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got children of an age that they can participate in training like our six-year-old can getting that child to do exercise with the dog like to sit and stare they 'll sit and stay creates an association from the puppy to the child is a source of information and something that they should sit and look at instead of chase and round up so getting kids involved in training the dogs under control with treats and the guidance and supervision of an adult can really help prevent the puppy viewing the child as another you know playmate or a chew toy or anything like that yeah we get our kids too so they are involved in the puppy without actually being um becoming nervous because it 's biting is to create enrichment and give it to the puppy or to do a scav hunt in the backyard by hiding all the puppies food you know there 's ways of engaging kids and puppies without it having to be a free-for-all because that never ends well um how do i get i hope we 've got just enough question for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along yeah um i i think there 's a two-pronged approach to this the first one is again management but preventing the dog from being able to chase the cat or terrorize the cat but the other one is looking at the cat as an individual and trying to make the cat be very confident in the presence of the dog so what i usually suggest to clients is that we might have the dog in a crate or on a tie-up exercise or in a location where the dog is calmer and more relaxed and then we bring the cat into the room or trying to lure the cat into the room or in the same space or somewhere where the dog and the cat can see each other and give the cat really really high value food items now cats are you know supreme carnivores so i 'm not just going to give them a little bit of dry food i 'm going to give the cat something amazing that makes the cat struck around and appeared confident and less interesting to the dog or not skittish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crab meat sardines fresh roast chicken anything that 's going to be really delicious and have the cat focused on eating and you know moving around the room as a confident animal not something that a dog want to chase so dogs will chase cats that are skittish and nervy the super confident cat struts around really limits the dog 's predatory response and creates a different association from the cat being something fun to chase to the cat just being another living being in the environment that he 's confident neutral that 's all back to the socialization thing it 's just rather than trying to forge a relationship um that ends up being you know maybe what you 've found yourself in the situation of now is just trying to make the cat boring don 't worry about it and then they then naturally that relationship forms over time so yeah awesome i think that 's it that 's brought us to 12 of 1 30. i hope you enjoyed go out and buy our book uh especially because we didn 't go into the outlets at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in here uh and all the best with your dogs uh if you want to learn more about us you can get us at www.tapeanimals.com um there 's short

AUS,QLD,Cairns Regional Council,Cairns Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/user/CouncilCairns,Author talk with Heather Morris,bXraZwXH2UM,20210531,3181.44,"Cairns City QLD 4870, Australia",9755,[Music] thank you so much for inviting me to be with you this evening and for the opportunity to we 'll have a chat to you about my books uh i 'm just delighted that libraries all around australia and other countries too share authors like myself due to the technology that we now have i can 't come and visit you but actually i probably can now can 't i never mind we 've organized this when i couldn 't i have to tell you actually i did sneak into brisbane last week on tuesday the day that your premiere opened the border i have family up there and i needed to see my little grandson so i flew up for six days but that 's not what you tuned in to uh hear me talk about so let me hear once again introduce myself i am the author of the tattooist of auschwitz silke 's journey and uh released a couple of months ago now or nearly two months ago stories of hope so i 'm going to talk to you about well all three because i cannot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without talking to you about the other two because while they 're all intrinsically entwined stories of hope came about because of lali and silker 's story silke 's story came about because of lolly 's story it 's kind of how my life is everything 's now missing but uh i love the opportunity to talk to you anyone about particularly lolly and silke i 'll go back a little bit because i haven 't been to cairns and i haven 't had a chance to talk to you and so by just going back a little bit and telling you how i got the original story that sent me off on this incredible well it is a journey not like silkes thank goodness but it is a journey here i am getting ready for retirement and i hit retirement age and i produce a book my first novel the tattoo was devel schwetz i got this story because well probably 15 years ago that 's how far back the story goes by the way i said yes to a friend and having a cup of coffee i said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in a cafe it was december 2003. do the math i think that 's more than 15 years she calmly said to me oh by the way i have a friend whose mother 's just died and i 'm sorry to hear that she said yes his father has asked him to find somebody he can tell a story to that person can 't be jewish you 're not jewish do you want to meet her i said well what 's the story and she said i don 't know so i said well never mind yes i 'd love to meet him and so it was a week later exactly that i knocked on the door of lady suckaloff 87 years of age as i said a man who had just lost his wife the love of his life somebody who i would then learn to follow this story of these two young people where they met how they met and get from lolly a story which well it 's in 55 countries now folks yeah 55 47 of them are foreign translations and um last count it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double that easy for the number of people who would have read it so it 's pretty phenomenal but i struggle to process it so i don 't try but i 'm just throwing that out there so that you know where i 'm coming from with that story i 'm going to fast forward to silke 's story i weave around a bit but i 'm hoping you 'll be able to follow me because as i said they all cover each other and telling lolly 's story which by the way i wrote as a screenplay i didn 't know how to write a book i never considered mind you i didn 't even know if i was going to get a story from lolly that was worth telling or writing because for many many weeks well he talked to me with his head down greeting me every time with have you finished my book yet and i would say no lally and i 'm writing a screenplay and then he would follow up with well hurry up i need to be with guitar so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry up i don 't know i don 't want to continue living in this world oh no pressure right except there was plenty of pressure now in terms of getting the story from him well for those many many weeks he was just very clinical very factual um he was telling me incredible stories but the one thing that was missing from them was any emotional connection between him and the stories he was sharing with me so one day i decided look i guess the only way i can get you to actually get to know me because why should you trust me i 'm a perfect stranger yes he wanted to meet me there was no question about that yes he welcomed me into his home every time i turned up there which by the way was two to three times a week but um that structured me to say he knew me or he could trust me so one sunday afternoon i took him home to meet my family husband and three young adult children well that did the job in those few hours that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him for the first time laugh he hadn 't laughed before and it wasn 't just a laugh it was a giggle i used to tease him you giggle like a school girl and that would just make him giggle all the more i also caught him flirting with my 18 year old daughter i tried to have words to him about that but when he pointed out to me that she was the same age geeta was when he met her i kind of backed away i went right okay i won 't go there but that did the trick because those wrap bags of children of mine as i say they 're all young adults they thought it would be the right thing to do to tell lolly all my faults all my foils all my insecurities every negative thing they could come up with they shared with him and told him about me starting with she 's a lousy cook dad has to do most of it so that when i was driving him home after that is when he kind of turned to me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't know how he expected me to be and i went no no i 'm the ordinary person you 're the extraordinary person but no he wouldn 't have it he now knew things about me and it had the desired effect it then allowed him to will start to talk to me more um emotionally and and connecting more with the stories he told me and not shying away so much from some of the really painful evil things that he had witnessed and experienced during his time in auschwitz-birkenau you know there 's another reason by the way i got his story uh he had two dogs he caught him as doggies or sometimes they were the kiddos and every time we were together these two dogs were with us that was constant companions you know one of them was this huge thing she was about the size of a small pony and the other thing portugal bam bam was she was smaller than my cat but these two dogs were devoted to each other and they were devoted to lolly and then whenever we sat in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever i arrived he promptly went out and made me the worst cups of coffee i 've ever tasted he never once asked me if i wanted coffee he never once asked me how i wanted it i was getting it the way lolly made it and i was gonna like it lukewarm weak gray but um i drank the coffee but as i said those two doggies they were there with us at all times and they would come up uh frequently one of them eat taking turn and they 'd have a tennis ball in their mouth and now they would just take it out of their mouth and throw it over his shoulder and they would chase off and fight for it and well tootsie the big dog she always won but bam bam never gave up trying however this one day not long after luddy had been home and met my family tootsie came up with a tennis ball now ladies just you know blindly reached down to take it you could see her she was beside him and she came up well over his knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she growled at him i 've never heard these dogs bark let alone growl and we both looked out this dog okay what 's going on and nobody gave her a little clip over the ear and said naughty taught see give me the ball and you tried again to take it from her and she growled again then i 'm not like tootsie turned around and she put her head on my knee and just looked at me i looked down at this huge mouth and these big teeth but i took a punt on it and i put my hand down and i into her mouth and i gripped the tennis ball and she let it go and i threw it over my shoulder the two of the dog is chased off after it and lolly turned round and watched all this and that 's when he said ah my dog is like you i like you you can tell my story and at that point it was like flicking a light switch with him as he started sharing and emotionally connecting with what he was telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what he only wanted to tell me initially was this incredible love story how lucky was i to be not only sitting with living history but living history who had a story set in this evil place there was a love story here he was a man who was a self-confessed playboy to me he lived the good life and brushes lava prime to going into auschwitz he had the good job didn 't find clothes and many many girlfriends he told me he loved them all and he loved none [Music] so this was my lolli now telling me how he held the arm of the young girl dressed in rags and her head shaven and stared into her eyes he said they were black they 're just incredibly dark brown and he 's now telling me 60 plus years later i knew in that second i could never love another incredible story that transcended all those decades so as his story unfolded and as i continue to try and write it up i just sat by the way and listened to him that 's important because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i never took a pen and paper with me or a recording device i just sat and listened and i was able to then go home and then on my computer right up what it was that he 'd said and that the information he 'd given me and wow i had some trouble with some of the names because he 's giving me german names and polish names and hungarian names and of course slovakia names and i 'm not the best with languages at the best of time and let alone trying to phonetically write down these names he 's throwing at me but i did that and when the time was appropriate um after a couple of times or even the next time i saw him then i would often just say to him towards the end when i 'd shut him down because it was important for me to shut him down when he was talking when i determined that it had enough that time was up and then i would say to him oh by the way do you remember last time you were telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase it like that and he 'd go yeah schwarzerber and i said okay can you get a pen and paper and write down that name for me and that 's how i was getting the information just at the end of our talking casually saying you can 't write that name down for me i can 't spell beretsky you spoke oretsky for me and um and make a bit of a game of art and so and that kind of intensive listening that 's how he well not only didn 't get distracted but that 's how he he knew that i was listening to him because i could tell him what it was he was telling me and that 's what listening is all about i 'll come back to it again in a minute but just you need to know that 's how i got his story now and telling her story and writing it as a screenplay i hope to see it on a big screen and that 's how i learned i did do some studying and how to write a screenplay the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've got three acts and you must achieve this and that and the other and each act and you must have your emotional arcs and have this within 10 pages great set of rules writing a screenplay and you follow them unless you 're quentin tarantino and i 'm not just putting it out there i 'm not so having his story now is a screenplay well i never really can i could continue to get it the whole three years i knew him but our friendship changed from being the person who was getting his story and telling it to now just a very deep personal friendship it was about six months into our relationship that he said to me one day when i go out with him the following sunday afternoon i 'm sure what where because up until now we 'd pretty much stayed in his apartment or we 'd taken the dogs for walks well i had started to say to him because i decided that my life was too short to continue drinking bad coffee that we would then start going out to local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as friends and they would talk to us and sometimes we sat with them and they got to know who i was it was generally just two or three of his contemporaries you know these men also survivors and so they got to know who i was and what i was in his life and then they says can we go out he wanted to reconnect with the jewish community who had totally pulled away from and so i arrived one sunday afternoon and off we went to the address we had to go to it was a function center it was going to be a big function he didn 't quite tell me what it was about he kind of held that back from me and he also made me just wait in the car with him until it was past the time that it was due to start and i can 't i 'm trying to say to him you know why aren 't we going in everybody else you could see people going in and going no no we wait we wait and then when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go and we walked into this function room and there was 200 plus people there quintessentially of the era men on one side and women on the other and as we walked in he just stopped in the doorway and people turned around and saw him and started calling out his name all of them lollies here so excited and you know the buddy he just started taking a bow like an actor after a fine performance on a stage and then he turned to me anyway she my girlfriend hey ladies you look after her i pick her up on the way out and promptly pushed me over to spend time with the ladies well i had no problem with that because now i got to spend time with this beautiful amazing woman who also the majority of whom were holocaust survivors and now i got to hear about what it was like for the woman in that place and yes that did enable me to write the part of the gita 's story trying to being able to get that from them because i never got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video tape that gita made for the showa foundation and he gave it to me to watch so i 'd have had the pleasure many times of looking at the amazing gita telling her story but i 'm now going to jump to silke because at some point it was many many months afterwards that lolly said to me did i tell you about silke and i said that was the phrase he used to me the whole three years i knew him the number of times even well close to the three year up until the time that he died he would continually say to me did i tell you about and i go what you need to tell me something and i 'll go i know your bugger it 's the first time hearing of it but i guess that 's what memory is like isn 't it it just comes back unsolicited and when it feels like it you can 't always have that recall when you want it but the day he said to me about silke and when i asked no who was she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said she was the bravest person not the bravest girl the bravest person i ever knew and she saved my life you and i would not be here without her and that waking of the finger by the way that 's what he did to me all the time he weighed his finger and he rolled his eyes at me however i needed to know more about silke if she was so important to him i needed him to try and tell me and over the time he did and then he started saying now when you finish telling writing my book and only after you 've written mine you must write the story of silke you must tell the world about this girl the 16 year old girl just turned 16 in march 1942 who a month later found herself in auschwitz and for those who haven 't read her story i 'll just you know tell you what the background to it is very very briefly because if you have read it then you don 't want to hear about it anymore do you um and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lolly and i because i 'm finding that more and more when i 'm now talking to people i go there here tomorrow i was talking about the tattoos of auschwitz well people are saying to me after two plus years nearly three years now we 've read the book tell us something we don 't know so that 's why i tell you these little vignettes about my time with lolly there 's many many more three years worth but silke for anyone who hasn 't doesn 't know her story she survived in auschwitz birkenau by being the sex slave of the commandant there and i will not sugarcoat it i 'm not going to dance around how she survived and say that she was a comfort woman no she is not a spoil of war she was raped it 's pure and simple and i call it out for what it is in her story and she was there when the russians came and liberated the camp in 1945 only to be charged with prostituting herself to the enemy and sent to a siberian gulag bukuta that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coldest goddamn places on earth and that 's where she ended up well she was sentenced for 15 years but she was there for ten she did get released early but lily told me about her he told me how guitar had visited her in slovakia in the 80s when she went back to visit her brothers also the 60s and the 70s so i knew she had survived and i knew that gita had corresponded with her all those decades and so i was able to get information about her now one of the reasons well it 's not one of the reasons but one of the things that i really wanted to tell you in stories of hope i 'm kind of getting around to that now as i wanted to be able to tell readers how i went about telling her story you all know i had lolli in my life i had him telling me his story so how could i tell silkers when she was no longer alive to a tell me her story and also to get permission to write her story well i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was needing to tell it as factually and accurately as i could of course i had to i can 't make this stuff up that 's just not right so to be able to tell you about her time in the gulag and this is what i also now share with you in stories of hope when i talk about getting that information how i had a professional researcher in moscow get me all the information they could from that time period that she was in the gulag 45 to 55 was closer to 56 actually that information about that gulag and only during that time and only that goulet and they did so i got photos and documents and testimonies mountains of information that enabled me to write and tell you what her life was like there and then these wonderful people in slovakia in lonnie 's hometown it 's it 's called krumpaki it 's a beautiful little of a hamlet really it 's just you know driving a drive out little hamlet the base of the tastro mountains and it 's gosh it 's gorgeous scenically stunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests all around with those people in krimpaki i 'm an honorary compaction by the way just putting that out there um i go there as often as i can and i have to stay in kosciutta which is the nearest town and the mayor sends her driver peter to pick me up each day and i come to the town and the school kids and the primary and the secondary put on concerts and it just is an amazing time and several of them speak english and they 're now friends and we i communicate with them well they offered to try and find out what they could about silken i knew that she lived in kosciutta and she 'd lived there for decades but they did find the apartment building where she had lived here 's the thing about living in slovakia you don 't live like we do in terms of your home you don 't leave your parents and get a flat and you sort of upsize and downsize and upsize and downsize and we spend our whole lives doing that don 't we well some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sizing i 'm into right now that 's one or the other but um did you get giving an apartment and in that apartment they stay the whole their much most of their whole lives so i found myself on several occasions now back in cochita in that apartment building in the next door neighbors house or apartment where silke had lived and the people who lived in all the other apartments in that block would come in and sit and talk to me and they would share their stories of silk up or cecilia they called it cecilia and that is how i was able to tell her story i got it from the people the friends and neighbors who knew her and so being able to tell you that and stories of hope and more of the stories about um was important to me that 's not the reason the book came about it did come about because of something that happened in kosciuta on one of those trips there when i was talking to the neighbours and the friends i was there i think about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in london and picked up my publisher there margaret she 's followed kiwi and we went there and we were staying in this hotel and we were there for about a week and we 're doing all sorts of other research as well and um yeah one night after we 've spent time with these people the neighbors and friends we had dinner in the hotel and we were about to go back to our rooms and we walked past this staircase that was going downstairs we wondered what that was because we were on the ground floor so we went and investigated it and we found this little dungeon bar down there tiny dark oh let 's have a coffee in a port we decided so we did have a coffee in a port and then we dropped the coffee and we had a few more ports but um that was there that margaret said to me how she had been sitting watching these people who do not speak english and i do not speak slovakian other than to say jaquiem which is thank you how they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah we weren 't just looking at each other these these beautiful people from kompaki i would say ask a question in english and they would translate and vice versa but all that time i just sat there focused on the person who was talking and the group that were in the room at one point i think we had 20 in there one at one point tiny little room they 're all on the floor and falling over each other but yeah margaret said whenever she asked the question they kind of ignored her but seemed to want to tell me not only everything about silke they all got carried away want to tell me about their lives too and she said how did you learn to do that to just sort of listen and focus on people i said oh my great grandfather gramps when i was a girl and he taught me he told me about listening and i 've never forgotten and i just automatically practice it that 's what i do it 's who i am and the more i told her about my great-grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zealand when i was growing up and this amazing man kind of took me under his wing he was the most significant adult in my life growing up neither of my parents did well either much talking and definitely not much listening to me four rowdy brothers i never got much of a word and i don 't recall that i even really tried much but i had this amazing old man gramps in my life and every afternoon from on the way home from school i would stop off and sit on the back veranda with him and the man now in his 80s over the next two or three years that i did this he kept telling me stories of his life and amazing stories but and telling me these stories he was telling me teaching me how to listen and his words you will never learn anything if you do not listen and that also included not just people talking but to the environment around us how to be able to listen to the the sound of the cows or the dogs and be rounding them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify even though i couldn 't see them you say which which one of the dogs is that when would he went barking and by listening to it i could say oh yeah it 's so-and-so i could name the dog and then we 'd hear a tractor or some kind of farm machine machinery and you go whose tractor 's at and i 'd listen i go ah i think that three carpet you know i 'd come up with the name nick correct you 're listening you 're using the thing between your ears just not your ears and so that 's how i 've kind of lived my life um listening to people my life or my work life for 20 plus years was in a major hospital here in melbourne a large hospital and in the social work department i can tell you the people who i met there every day many of whom well they woke up that morning and they did not know that they 'd be talking to me before the day was out something tragic or traumatic brought them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to hear me talk i was not yes they wanted to hear the medical and nursing people they were the ones who were going to be relaying information but my job was just actually to listen to them to see how anyway i could be of help to them and i was involved in several programs particularly programs in the hospital that uh brought me into contact with say different people every day of the week and you have some of them that time frame went on for days or a week or two but it was an acute hospital so we never had people in the hospital any longer than they needed to be which meant that my time with them was all released the call was actually band-aiding because we were there to fix an acute problem you know not a chronic long-term one it 's just the nature of the hospital but of course i listened to them and then as i 've just been telling you i knew how to listen to lolly listening you think you do it all day and you do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're with some other person is we 're communicating we 're talking we 're sharing we 're not necessarily listening we 're listening enough to respond to what 's being said we 're listening enough to formulate something in our own head that can come back and give out two bobs worth of what the conversation 's about and yeah that 's perfectly fine that 's what makes the world go around communication that 's great i 'm not in any way decrying it it 's just occasionally if you stop and listen to somebody they start telling you something let them go see where that takes them they may be wanting to share more with you than you actually realize but if you keep saying you 're true bob 's worth well you 'll actually shut anybody who wants to talk to you 'll shut them down because they they 'll pick up you you think about yourself somebody starts interrupting to tell you oh yeah i 've been there oh yeah i 've got that i know somebody who did that and when we do that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've trumped them so listening and this comes down to you know you may not want to you may not never want to have a an in-depth conversation with somebody and that 's fine too but here 's the other thing that we learned from well all the talks that i do with the sheer number of people who would come up to me after i 've been talking and and i 'll chat to them and we keep hearing the same when i say we by the way i 'm talking about my my mind is my publicist or my manager somebody from my publishers who more often than not came with me comes with me to events i don 't come anymore do they and i sort of sit in my lounge room here and stare down this tiny little hole in my laptop there and i hope that out there there 's somebody listening i don 't know it may not be for all i know but i 'm gonna carry on in case there is but um the people who would now be saying to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over that heard me talk about getting lolly 's story and now they were saying to me i regret that i did not talk to my mother my father my grandparent my uncle a sibling who 's no longer alive regret regret regret i knew that i 'd heard little bits about something remarkable in their lives something extraordinary and i never took the time to really find out what it was and now they 're gone i never will and so the whole notion of regressing things in life it doesn 't sit well with me and i 've actually tried to live my life to get to the point where i have no regrets of course that 's impossible uh i have a regret of course for me that i actually never spoke to my father like this i never asked him i i think in fact i know he was an interesting man you know some of my siblings have got bits of stories about him and i 've got bits but i never gave my own father the the time to to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have liked to my other most um outstanding regret right now is i have never learned to play the guitar properly it 's something i 've wanted to do for ever since i was a little kid i was given my first ukulele and then and the guitar is a teenager but i don 't know how to play it properly but i want to and i will one day so hearing people saying how much they regret and that whole notion too that they would be saying i learned so much about my mother at her funeral there is this one place that people would get up and do get up and share stories about the person who has just died and people said i hearing things i had no idea happened to my parents i now heard it at their funeral it 's too late it 's too late so in stories of hope what i 'm trying to say is look at the experiences that i 've had and yeah it 's um there 's no infection not a memoir and i get carried away you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do learn a little bit and one of the reasons the other reasons for the book is the sheer number of people who also have written to me and their thousands telling me something tragic or traumatic in their life and linking how they 're coping with that to lolly gita and silke saying that in reading their stories they find hope and that was the other word that was just coming out in every email hope you 've given me hope to cope to move on to carry on you 've given me hope because of their suffering but their survival and they 're continuing to go on and have a good life well then you know i 'm going to try and do the same too and so so many letters from so many courageous people who are able to write to this strange woman at the other end of the world and share something deeply personal about themselves yeah gosh how lucky am i that these people do that uh some of these stories honest folks they are absolutely overwhelmingly beautiful tragic funny everything so i figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and maybe it was time for me to find some courage and do something similar and so there is some stories in there about me uh or my family that are deeply personal i have found the courage to tell you a little bit more about who i am something i shied away from ever since the books come out i couldn 't see any new why would you want to know anything about me i 'm just the person who 's lucky to get the stories and i couldn 't understand why they would ever want to be any interest in me anyway i 've been very clear that they may be my books but they 're not my stories i 'm the custodian of the stories that are given to me and i just get to to give a voice to them on paper so that 's why stories of hope it was decided we i would write such a book because i get inspiration and hope from you the readers out there who write to me and the ones who come up and talk to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how to write that how to encompass all that well we decided to weave it around that notion that i was just talking about which is listening and i even give you some tips and some hints on how to listen not from the perspective of somebody qualified like a psychologist or a psychiatrist or counselor i am none of these things but just from my personal perspective of what worked for me and in the hope that maybe it might work for one or two of you who do want to talk to somebody and find out about somebody 's uh life that you know not their whole life we 're talking about bits of them aren 't we it 's just these things at a moment in time that you have got an inkling about and you just don 't know the full story so i write chapters like listening to your elders and of course the elders i refer to are my great grandfather gramps and of course lolly they fit neatly into that category i 'm beginning to think that i 'm starting to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can probably tag to me i 'm going to come up with a nicer one i think i 'll work on that but um that 's different and there 's a different skill set and asking somebody what skills yeah there 's the you know the thing to do when this thing is really quite simple it is um the first thing you 've got to do is shut up just shut up let somebody talk and if there 's a pause and they go quiet on you well you know suck it up and stay in that silence for a little bit longer don 't feel the need to fill that silence because nine times out of ten you 'll find that that person you 're talking well not you 're listening to they will come back with something but here 's the thing if they don 't if you look like it 's it 's just restored but somebody is emotionally starting to connect with you well the thing for you to do is to repeat back to them the last thing they said that is how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell them the last thing they said and those these are just some tips and hints i give you and one of the things i suggest is you got a family friend or a family member who you 've known for decades heard something about them and you think you might want to know a little bit more think about their home the home that you 've probably been into thousands hundreds of times they 'll have photos on their wall they 'll have knick-knacks trinkets on their mantelpiece and around their home and if they 're like me and i suspect everyone yeah we 're all the same those things that are on public display are there for a reason they 're actually not there for the public or the people who come into their home well mine aren 't what i have on display and what i suspect you do as well are things that mean something to you there 's some connection to that trinket to that photo of those people and one way to find out a little bit more and just to show somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're doing is to maybe one day just pick pick something up something you 've seen for decades or years and go hey can you tell me where you bought that do you know who you were with where were you yeah what is it just ask about something that 's a phone i can 't it just happened to be the handiest thing i could grab but in doing that um that 's how you engage with people and here 's the thing you 'll be the one that will be rewarded when you do that now the other aspect that i i cover in the book and and these are the things that um again i 'm trying to just share my own experiences with you and so i have this chapter also called talking to your children you know i was telling my three adult children and uh all their partners and a couple little grandkids when i was writing this chapter oh guess what chapter i 'm working on in stories of hope it 's the listening to your children chapter and my three kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing and they went you 're not qualified to tell that or to write that and so uh yeah a bit of fun was had at my expense as they tried to point out that they never felt that i necessarily listened to them all the time but the thing was actually i was able to prove them wrong i was able to say well what didn 't i listen to you about and they 'd come up with ah you know i remember telling you a little bit about such and such and i 'd finish it off so yeah listening to your children and the great thing is that i 've had people write to me who read the book and say that these different little chapters and segments in it not all of it 's going to resonate with you it mean anything to you but they say look they 're listening to your children thing i 've got four and five and six-year-olds and i read that and then i went and sat down and went tell me about you know what you 're doing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are actively listening to them now with kids you can 't do that all the time i know i 've got this four-year-old granddaughter she was here she left about an hour ago and she never shuts up so it 's impossible to listen to rachel all her waking hours uh but every now and then you know what both her mom and her dad and i we do stop you pause what you 're doing even if it doesn 't seem important and get down to her level and and listen to her and what you hear come out of the mouths of these little kids well we all know that they 're a lot smarter and wiser than we give them credit for don 't we but in listening to them and letting them know that you 're listening well here 's here 's the outcome of that it pays off down the track because when they tell you things when they 're four five and six years old and you just think oh it 's just a little thing and you don 't respond properly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're young why should they when they get to be teenagers that 's when you want them to be talking to you well why should they if you haven 't listened to the little things which to them were big things then you run the risk of them not telling you the big things when you want to hear them and i 've just realized that i did not put enough lights on around me and i 'm possibly getting a little bit dark here i 'm sorry about that was brilliant sunshine when i started talking and now it 's uh it 's getting dark and i don 't have enough light so i do apologize for that but um listen to your children by the way it doesn 't end as we all know well as parents of adult children know it doesn 't end as they grow older um and i share in there a story that happened 12 months ago this month to me and and my daughter and son-in-law and it involves a newborn baby uh the two siblings and my coming back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh well not recognize initially that what was going on with my daughter and and missing all those non-verbal cues because here 's the thing we 're not only talking with our mouths our bodies are talking also and i was just putting down what was going on with her she 's tired she 's got a newborn she 's got these other two little attackers running around and and her husband was frantically trying to help the best he could and nothing was working and i was home five or six days before i started to realize oh something 's not quite right here and um i was there i was here every day i would go around there until i asked i told her to go and do something it was actually have a shower it was the middle of the day i don 't have a shower i 've got the baby at which point she screamed at her husband and i why aren 't you listening to me she hadn 't said a thing but my goodness had her body been screaming at us had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postnatal depression and we hadn 't picked it up thankfully because of that outburst we did now she and her husband have given me permission to share the story and again that is a vignette out of stories of hope in which people have written to me telling me what you 've said and described happening to your daughter happened to my partner to my sister to my own daughter and i didn 't pick it um and so that 's what stories of hope is it 's about sort of just sharing some of those things now i 'm not sure if there 's going to be any questions coming but i want to just get on to on my next book because in stories of hope i 'll give you a little teaser about it here in the back there 's this little short story it 's only very short two three pages what i 'm doing is telling you about my next novel let me tell you how i got my next novel i was in south africa in france of south africa in june last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't know it was about day three or four i got back to my hotel room until the early hours of the morning actually i did tell you it was the wine region didn 't i very nice wines and i wasn 't sleepy so i opened up an email and read an email it was written to me from a man who lives in toronto in canada and he told me that he was flying to meet and go and see his mom who lived in tel aviv and he picked up a copy of my book at the toronto airport i am so so glad that canada had the same cover that we do otherwise i would not be telling the story they have the cover only canada and brazil have the same cover out of the 55 countries that have published he had that book with him and the next morning he got up and brought it out into his mum 's living room thinking well you know i 'll read some more of it and he put it on a coffee table and his mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she saw the cover and she said that must be about lully and guitar she knew to say that because she sought the number on the arm on the cover and then she looked at the number on her own arm it 's three away and she knew that her oldest sister sippy her number was two away she knew that bloody had tattooed her and reading that i immediately responded of course and over the next couple of days many emails flowed between us and i 'm sending them off to my publishers in london as well keeping them in the loop saying this amazing lady is writing me the most amazing things not only about lolly and gita but about herself as well and and her survival and i got to cape town a couple of days later and i got a message saying she wanted to talk to me on the phone so i rang her and had a chat to her her english is fine she actually lived in london for a while as a young woman but um she started telling me things and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in person can you come and see me i said ultra i 'll arrange it i will so i said to the publishers oh look when i get back home i 'm going to see if i can quickly go to israel and then a couple of days later i was in johannesburg and i had about 24 hours left to be there and i got a call from my publisher and kate said to me uh you know how you 're going to israel yeah i 'm going home to melbourne tomorrow and then i 'll arrange something and she said no no we 're rerouting you you 're going from johannesburg to tel aviv now i remember saying but kate i can 't and she said well why not i said because i 've run out of clean knickers you know i timed it perfectly well she pointed out to me that i could either go shopping i could learn how to wash my own knickers and um i went shopping just heads up but just 24 hours later i stepped off a plane in tel aviv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to know the story of three sisters that 's going to be the name of the book released in october next year three sisters simple olivia 15 magnus 17 sibi 19. they came from the same town as gita they went to school with gita two of them the oldest and the youngest were on the train going to auschwitz with gita magda the one in the middle she wasn 't she wasn 't home and didn 't get taken away and so she has this sort of other story thread running through but she did end up there and they then found each other these three sisters reconnected in birkenau at death camp where over a million and a half people were murdered but at any point in time there could be a hundred thousand people there it was meant to be so this story of what they saw and what they experienced and were part of well of course it 's unique every holocaust survivor 's story is unique and some of the storylines there we cannot find them anywhere in any other testimony or academic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death march that those three girls were taken out on on the in january of 1945 and their escape from it well it could be a book in itself incredible story of escape the three sisters and about half a dozen other girls decided that they were going to run they 'd take a bullet in the back rather than spend another day under the control of the nazis that bullet didn 't come and the next four weeks of their traveling through poland and germany to get to the allies not knowing where they were going they had no compass they had no idea coming across more germans and russians and the threats that came to them uh as they try to reach safety which they did but that that 's an incredible story lines through that period it doesn 't end there they go back to slovakia they did and once again they were being rejected by the country of their birth so eventually they decided they couldn 't stay so they joined several other young holocaust survivors and together with a couple of other people who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting with the russians they went into the forests up in the czech republic and there for three months they trained and they learned how to survive on their own and just with whatever guiles they had and they learned how to drive a truck they got a truck so they could learn how to drive and they got weapons and they learned how to shoot and three months later they then journeyed the length of slovakia and yeah i know it 's not that big it 's a small country compared to ours but it 's still reasonable and you 've got to remember that it was all under communist control and they get got to romania they crossed over there and then had to go the whole length of romania to get to the black sea and there they boarded a boat each with a gun in their pocket and they got off that boat in haifa at that time in history when rightly or wrongly and i make no judgment call on this united nations was taking that patch of desert away from the palestinians and giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the formation and the founding and the creation of the state of israel i can tell you about that not through the eyes of the bureaucrats and the government officials and the army and the military and the politicians were through the eyes of three young girls and how they forged and were involved in that creation of that country that state and two of them actually worked for the very first president of israel president wiseman mrs wiseman came to olivia 's wedding two of them olivia she 's 94 magnus she 's 96 they 're still alive i got to go back in january not knowing that the world was suddenly going to go pear-shaped on us all and spend more time with not only them but their families their adult children their adult grandchildren and and they are all

Australia",11000,[Music] good evening everyone hopefully you can hear me out there i hope we 've got a few people joining us so whether you 're joining us from cairns in queensland or from other parts of australia or even overseas it 's great to have you here my name is tony park uh i 'm the author of 18 thriller novels set in africa including my latest last survivor which i 'll be talking about a little bit later on um if you haven 't heard of me or read any of my books then i will talk a little bit about my background and how it is that me and aussie came to be writing books in in africa and if you are aware of me then you may have seen on my facebook that i 've also promised to talk about something new tonight i have been involved in another book which is due for release next week in case i forget later on i 'd like to give a couple of thank yous thank you very much first of all to keen city libraries for having me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us my world was thrown into disarray with the advent of the coronavirus and i actually had about a month 's worth of touring planned around australia to coincide with the launch of last survivor in july and then later in the year around about now i was going to be in south africa which as you may know or may learn soon is my other home my wife and i live half the year in australia and half the year in africa specifically in south africa and by now i would have been touring around south africa talking about the book the great irony and interesting fact is that the very first library that i was scheduled to talk at way back at the start of july was cairns library i had spoken to cairns library before and had a wonderful reception from all the staff there thanks to a reader of mine who specifically asked if the library would accommodate me to do a talk on a previous book which i did and i had such a great response that i was very keen to go back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ july so it 's nice to be here and i guess in a fitting way to close it off this is probably the last online talk that i will be doing for last survivor which has been out now i would like to say a thank you to to the cairns bookstore which is our has been promoting this event as well too and uh last survivor and another book that i 'll be talking about a little bit later on are available at ken 's bookstore and i 'm sure they would love to sell you a copy and if you are a patron of the library they will have these books in stock that i 'm going to be talking about for you tomorrow most of all most importantly thank you for joining me wherever you 're from if you haven 't heard of me and you 've just tuned in out of interest or you 're a supporter of the library i do write novel set in africa how why i don 't know i all i know is from time i was a very small boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to write a book my mother had got me reading at a very very early age and encouraged uh or rather passed on her love of reading to me so from as far back as i could remember i was i was reading and my mum had had been a very strong influence in my life and although i don 't have kids of my own i do firmly believe the greatest gift that any parent or grandparent can give to a child is a love of reading i 'm very pleased to report as an aside that uh there may be very few positives out of this whole coronavirus thing and many people have been profoundly affected uh but if there 's a little ray of good news in this i can report that certainly here in australia is that people have been returning to reading my book last survival which i 'm quite proud of don 't get me wrong but i do not think it 's radically different from the previous 17 books i 've written as it turns out has sold about 30 more copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past let 's not i don 't think down to the book itself it 's due to a massive increase in book sales and reading during the lockdown periods in particular in australia so i 'm pleased to report that at least reading is gaining something of a resurgence during these tough times and i have to say i think that 's a great thing uh since i i the book came out in july when i would have been launching it in cairns uh the book made it to number eight overall in australia it made it to number three in australian fiction and i 'm very pleased um and slightly proud to say that in south africa it made it to the number one spot in adult fiction for a couple of weeks there and it 's still doing quite well i believe so thank you very much to everyone who 's bought a copy thank you very much if you support your local library as well too libraries are incredibly important to authors in australia so how did me as an aussie start writing books said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as i said the only thing i wanted to do in life was to write particularly in specifically i wanted to to write a novel but like everybody you know i had the whole life 's worth of experience i think to go through before i even got a chance to start writing properly it 's not something you can just do wake up one day and say i 'm going to be a writer because it 's a little bit of a risk particularly if you have your sights set on making writing a job but i think and i 've learned over the years that it 's good to have a little bit of life experience under your belt i wasn 't very good at anything else at school other than english so i had my hopes pinned on on doing something with the written word when i left school i went to university i didn 't do very well there i dropped out after a couple of years and i got a job at a local newspaper in sydney and i really took to that i loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about it tonight but i 'm going to talk a little bit tonight about another book as i mentioned and it 's a non-fiction book another two non-fiction books that i 've written and i do think that my time as a journalist working around sydney on local newspapers covering police rounds and courts and local politics and later working as a journalist in england which i did a few years later after that have helped me in the business of writing non-fiction if there are any if there 's anybody out there who 's interested in writing i 'd be very interested in any questions that you have about the process of writing whether it be fiction or non-fiction so during the course of the talk do please feel free in the comment section to shoot a few questions at me it certainly makes a lot easier for me doing the talk and there 's a lovely lady by the name of renee behind the scenes who 'll be sending those questions through to me so i 'll be able to have a look at them as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while i had this dream of writing a novel but i also had to to make a living and work i met a girl i got married i left my job in journalism to work for the new south wales state government as a press secretary as a media advisor for a few years i went back to journalism for a while worked in public sector public relations private sector public relations but burning away inside of me at the back of my mind and i think more importantly here was this desire to write a book and as i said before and if there 's anybody out there who 's interested in writing you know it 's not that easy to just wake up one day and say i 'm going to write a book now it takes time and it takes effort and and if you 're lucky you need or if you 're able to it takes time just to think and about what you want to write i found one of the hardest things in starting to follow this dream of mine was to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when i wanted to set my book that i was going to write because i all i knew was that i wanted to write fiction i didn 't have any firm ideas that i would where i would would set a book i made a couple of mistakes early on my first and biggest mistake is when i finally was able to give myself enough time to tackle the business of writing properly i set about making several key errors so when i was in my 30s i said to my wife one day i think i want to write a book you know how to write a book and she says well you don 't talk about anything else you 've been talking about that since i met you and i said i think the only way i could do it is to leave work because this was my dream and i was getting to an age where i thought if i don 't do something radical about it i 'm never going to get the chance so with her support and agreement i left my job at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she agreed that i could take six months to try and write a book so i did i felt under a bit of pressure but this is something that i had been waiting my whole life to do and and i think i was so keen that i was probably i was probably blinded i think by my enthusiasm i hadn 't had any formal training in creative writing as i said i 've worked as a journalist what i did the first thing i did wrong is that i wrote a book that i thought other people would want to read and buy i i thought oh well i want to write a book that say people in america or england or you will want to buy and read and i thought what do people overseas think about when they they think about australia because i 'm in australia they think about the outback so i thought i will write a book set in the outback the problem was i 'd never been there so my first mistake was writing a book about summer i 'd never been sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn 't have any connection with that part of rural australia i was a city boy i 've grown up in the in the suburbs and the other thing i did in writing that book is i read a couple of textbooks about how to write fiction and they both said that the most important thing that what you had to have first before you even before you started writing a story was you had to know the story you had to know the beginning in the middle and the end you had to have a plot you have to have everything mapped out and for sure that is a valid way to write a way to write books or essays or whatever it is you 're writing but i struggled i i struggled within my a lot of time to finish that book and i found the whole process once i had thought up a plot and beginning in the middle and the end to be very mechanical um quite difficult to think up an entire story before i even got to what i consider to be the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very predictable because from the moment i started writing that book i knew how it was going to end as i said it 's a valid way of of writing uh but to me it seemed terribly counter-intuitive uh and not fun my one recollection of that period writing that first manuscript was that it was not enjoyable and i thought is this what it 's like is this is this what following your dream is like is it is it just hard work um i thought it was gonna be a lot more fun than it was and that book went nowhere i finished the manuscript and it was never published and i think deservedly so because there was a lot wrong with it it was very predictable the the characters who might had to think up and before i even started writing were kind of you know very drab and mundane and i guess predictable in their own right as well too and uh having failed that first attempt i went back to work for a couple of years and it wasn 't until something else changed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at writing and the thing that changed in my life was africa my wife and i went on a holiday in 1995 was supposed to be a once in a lifetime safari holiday around south africa zimbabwe in botswana and i took a laptop computer with me actually took the computer with me because i thought i would do a bit of travel writing and see if i could sell some stories to some newspapers but when i was in in south africa the place grabbed me you know the continent really grabbed my wife and i had hooked us in and we found that the more we traveled the more we wanted to see and by the end of that first holiday we had decided that this once in a lifetime trip would be anything but and that we would have to come back so we did we went back the following year in 96 the year after in 97 and we were expending our annual leave traveling to africa in 1998 that 's when i had the laptop computer my wife and i went for an extended trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll have another go at writing a book but this time instead of writing a book that i thought other people want to read because quite frankly i by that stage i didn 't rate my chances of getting published very very high but i still wanted to write and i think that 's in important i i think it 's if you if you 're gonna if you have a dream um it shouldn 't just be about say success or making money it should be pursuing something that you really enjoy doing and really want to be able to if not make a living from it you want to be able to enjoy it and get some sort of fulfillment for it and i still felt that need to write so what i did on that trip was was i um i wrote a book that was very much for me it it was set on a fictitious tour around africa at the time that my wife and i were traveling around on an extended trip around africa and that first novel that i wrote that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a chronicle in some ways of that trip sure a few people get shot and killed and there 's a bit of murder of mayhem because i write thrillers but i was writing about a lot of fun experiences that i was having in my book while fairly serious was set in places that i was absolutely reveling in being in so to research simply involved looking around and soaking up my surroundings it was almost like a travel diary but written as a novel and i loved it i had so much fun the other thing i liked about it was that i had kind of learned from my first effort that i would have to break the rules the conventional idea that you have to have a plot before you start writing just didn 't work for me it 's not to say it doesn 't work for everyone i think it works for most novelists most of the writers that i now know work to a plot at least in some semi-structured way but i found what was more fun for me was to just make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not knowing what was going to happen was part of the fun for me and that kept me interested and engaged i 've got a question that 's come through already from kelly who says when i came to cairns last time i spoke about the vital role that my wife played in keeping the story line unpredictable for her at leicester and kelly asked does she still play that role yes very much so because what i found when i was writing that first book is i finished it i finished a manuscript and i read through it and i was kind of happy with it happier than i was in the first one but then i had to let someone else say it so i got it to my wife to read my wife has she 's very different to me she works in i.t she has a very methodical analytical mind and when she watches a tv show or reads a book she 's very good at picking the ending she 's very good at knowing what 's around the corner and what 's going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like oh yes i know what 's going to happen here and which was quite devastating for me because i had been making it up as i go along but she was telling me that what i was doing is i was subconsciously dropping clues or telegraphing my punches and letting the reader know or a candy reader like her know what was going to happen so with her help i was able to edit out some of those things that i had inadvertently slipped in there so she still plays that role she 's reading the manuscript now of a book that i 'm writing for next year and she 's already picking up quite a bit of stuff that i wouldn 't have expected her to pick up at this stage but that 's why we work quite well together as a team so she is my first reader always and yes kelly definitely helps me to make the books unpredictable because even though they 're kind of unpredictable to me while i 'm writing them she says that i am in the first draft at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book said on an extended trip about africa and it is leading to what i want to talk to talk about today my other big now big announcement but i found that worked for me traveling around africa drawing inspiration and just collecting information from our travels and and basing the books on current affairs and issues that i was learning about so of my 18 novels they reflect my wife and i my our ongoing experiences africa because we kept traveling every year kept going there backwards and forwards spending increasing amounts of time on the continent and it culminated with us spending six months of each year in africa from about 2004 when my first book was released and published by pam mcmillan and we still to this day usually spend six months of the year in africa and we have a house in south africa which we use as a base but of course things are upside down for us now i 'm in sydney and have been in sydney since january i haven 't been away from africa and my african home this long since 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to talk about about today because the last time i was away for africa for this long i was in afghanistan i was in the australian army reserve for 34 years i finished up a couple of years ago and without a doubt the most significant thing that happened to me in my career in the army was being sent to afghanistan in 2002 as an army public affairs officer where i worked with our special operations task group doing media support for them and looking after the public relations side of things it was an incredibly momentous time in my life for many reasons not only was it kind of the high point of my military career i had sent that first african book that i had written off to a publisher before i went to afghanistan the publishers came back to me published my publishers being pam mcmillan and said we can 't we quite like this book but it 's going to need quite a bit of work which is fair enough would you be prepared to take on board some advice from us and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so i i took on board all their criticisms and their their advice rewrote the book large sections of it sent it back into them and then after sending it into them i was given a call from the army and from one of my officer commanding officers and asked if i would like to volunteer to go to afghanistan which is the way it used to happen so i said yes i would like to volunteer to go to afghanistan and off i went i didn 't even tell the publishers that i 'd gone and so they like me were a little bit surprised when they emailed me in july of 2002 and said that we 've got good news we 're going to publish your book and i said that 's great news i 'm in afghanistan and that took them by surprise a little bit so that first book um far horizon i i got the word that it was going to be published in 2002. i it was subsequently published in 2004 but i was told in 2002 that it was going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i was over there in afghanistan if you have any time off in a military environment there 's really nothing to do so rather than just reading i started writing another book which is called zambezi subsequently and funnily enough that book starts off in afghanistan i wanted to mention afghanistan here because a lot of my books have a bit of a military a military angle and i 'll come back to it shortly and a lot of it 's based not so much on my personal experience which is not terribly exciting in the military but i was exposed to a lot of interesting things and lived in some interesting times the latest book last survivor is about of all things if you haven 't seen it plants endangered plants cycads i 've written in the past about endangered wildlife in africa rhinos that are illegally hunted for their horns and elephants for their ivory and trade-in lines and the trains in the trading birds for traditional medicine and there is a flourishing lucrative market implants specifically cycads south african psychoads these spiky things that look like palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and often garishly coloured cones which make them particularly attractive to collectors you might think it but some of these rare plants can be worth in the order of a hundred thousand us dollars in on the illegal collectors market internationally and i thought that would make a good idea for a story but as some people have pointed out on reading the book or picking it up they thought how can you make a book about plant smuggling interesting well that was one of the challenges that i faced not that i found plants quite interesting but i thought i could jazz it up with a bit of gum play so the thing that my plant collectors in this book have in common is that they have a uh they 're elderly people i 'm 56 they 're probably more in my age demographic or a little bit older but they all have a military background or a background with firearms and things and and i think that part of that springs from my experience in the military so in last survivor we have the world 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to not exist anymore is rediscovered it 's stolen it goes missing and a member of the pretoria cycad and firearms appreciation society my fictitious group of elderly gun-toting plant nuts is accused of the theft she 's on the run various people are after her and after the endangered pled which having been stolen it disappears again and her her fellow members of the cyclades society have to try and find her first of all and then try and find the missing plants it 's a bit of fun it touches on a serious issue but at the end of the day it 's a thriller and hopefully it 's a little bit of escapist entertainment for people as well too the elderly aging i should say perhaps or mature characters do like me have a little bit of a military background because it 's something that stays with you and i think that experience of mine the six months i spent in afghanistan it still stayed with me and and i think my time in the military has shaped my my writing too uh to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good adages in writing and one of them is right about what did you know so if there 's anybody interested out there in in writing as a starting point it 's probably good to draw on some of your personal experiences so for me that involved with my first successful novel drawing on my experiences in africa my love of the continent the fact that i was had not only been to africa a few times before i started writing but i was keen to learn more and i was keen to i guess pass on some of that learning and some of that knowledge in my writing for other people they might like to write books about somewhere they 've lived all their life there 's a lovely comment from from larry smart who writes as ltk i 've seen his books around lately he 's writing a novel set in africa and larry is from one of the countries i write about he grew up in zimbabwe probably rhodesia as it was and so you might want to write something based on somewhere you 've lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i not there 's anything wrong with that but i didn 't find much inspiration for thrillers working out there although if you watch the news in sydney these days you probably find plenty of material for thrillers or a crime story there i think as well as writing about what you know it 's probably important to write something that you 're passionate about and as i said earlier on in this business of writing it 's probably not a good idea to set your sights on being a professional writer because you think you 're going to get rich or famous out of it because the odds of both of those things are pretty highly stacked against you but i think like anything if you have a dream and you want to pursue it then you should and hopefully that 's something that 's going to give you some sort of enjoyment or fulfillment as you go along so i was lucky my first book was published in 2004 in far horizon i got the news when i was in afghanistan which was great but i couldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer but i came home and then proceeded to write a novel a year after that about 10 years ago i started writing nonfiction as well as a sideline i was asked to write the biography of a guy called kevin richardson who was a a lion whisperer in in south africa and that was my first foray into non-fiction it was something i hadn 't done before i got a question during the week from from one of my uh wonderful supporters a lady in west australia who reads my book by the name of sandy and and she asked me what 's the what 's the difference for me the key differences between writing fiction and non-fiction it 's a very very good question and i 'd just like to branch out and talk about that and talk a little bit briefly about a couple of other books including that new one that i had flagged earlier on i mentioned before that i worked as a journalist and and for people who are interested in writing sometimes they 've asked me do i think that 's essential do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you need to have done or do you need to have been a writer of some sort before you start writing books and i don 't think it 's a prerequisite at all in fact i would go so far as to say that having worked as a newspaper journalist with possibly more of a hindrance in writing fiction than if i had say studied creative writing because the two very different types of writing newspaper writing is very spare it 's very sparse we write one sentence per paragraph no more than 20 or 30 words we 're very short on adjectives and descriptions indeed that 's kind of drummed out of us from an early age so i had to unlearn a lot of things and i had to learn a lot of things along the way by trial and error to write fiction one thing i do think having worked as a reporter helped me with is dialogue because a large part of creative writing is is telling the story through the words of the characters and i think as a journalist you you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people speak not just their words but use their words to set the scene to illustrate a story and to capture the reality of that person you 're writing about so i do think that helps and having worked as a journalist definitely has helped me writing non-fiction the type of nonfiction writing i do is biographies i like to call them co-written biography some people call it ghost writing where i am writing someone else 's story but i like to be open about whose story i 'm i 'm i 'm writing and so i 've been lucky i 've done six of those uh non-fiction books earlier this year just after last survivor came out i released this book in fact we re-released this book this is a book called war dogs with a guy called shane bryant and me shane 's a lovely guy he 's a i don 't think it 's anything detracting from him for me to describe him as an ordinary knockabout bloke he is an absolutely wonderful human being a great guy an incredibly inspirational guy who i met by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection that i mentioned earlier on i had a friend serving in afghanistan and he sent me an email as many years after i had come back from the war and he said i 've met an amazing guy he 's an aussie guy who used to work in the new south wales police force and then in the australian army as a dog handler as an explosive detection dog handler and he had got a job in afghanistan working as a contractor for the united states army special forces working as a dog handler for them because in the early days of the war in afghanistan the americans didn 't have enough trained handlers or dogs so back in 2010 we wrote this book war dogs and it did reasonably well back at the time uh after that shane stayed on in afghanistan for about another five years and uh had a number of experiences some of them quite profound some of them quite bad and we got together again not long ago and decided that it might be a good idea to re-release an expanded version of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most [Music] poignantly i think in terms of the re-release book is that shane from the time that i had met him to the time this book came out had been diagnosed with post-traumatic post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of some pretty serious stuff that happened to him in afghanistan and he was very open about that and wanted to talk about that in his book because shane was part of a growing number of a very new breed of soldiers the contractors military contractors who increasingly took on a larger and larger burden of the of military operations in afghanistan and iraq as well too certainly from the american side of things they represented a very very significant part of their contribution to the war and at one time in afghanistan there were more civilian contractors working for the u.s military than there were uniformed military people in afghanistan over the course of 10 years shane went backwards and forwards to afghanistan basically on a fly-in fly-out basis whereas a lot of people in the australian military like myself did one tour of duty of afghanistan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six shane probably did the equivalent of about 20 tours of duty over that 10 years it 's not surprising it had a profound effect on him so we re-released war dogs um it 's available online but shane and i are very happy to to sell people a copy of that direct if you want to get in touch with us via facebook and i 'm very pleased to say that cairns library ahead of the game already has already got a copy available for loan and has another copy on order which brings me to my big news of the night i 've only had to wait half an hour for it if you have been one of my regular readers who 's tuned in i have another book coming out next week or rather someone else has a book coming out next week published by pam mcmillan it has been available for pre-order for some time so i 'm not breaking any terrible secrets but i do want to talk about this and for all the queenslanders in the audience this is the life story and momentous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of daniel kieran vc the vc stands for victoria cross dan was awarded the victoria cross for actions that he undertook in 2010 in afghanistan around about the time that shane and i were releasing his book about his first few years [Music] dan 's story is quite frankly incredible and i was honored and fortunate to have been put forward as a potential person to help dan tell his story my name is on the book in very small writing down the bottom but the important thing about this is not me the important thing about this is that this is an incredibly inspirational guy who received our nation 's highest award for valor on the field in afghanistan and i cannot think of a more deserving person it 's not just a military book um carriage under fire dan 's story is very much a story about dan 's life and what led him to this fateful day in afghanistan in 2010 when he performed some quite amazing feats that resulted in being presented with the victoria cross he had quite a difficult upbringing um he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father for 10 years before dan met him then didn 't actually meet him until he was 11 dan 's father had left them when he was about one year old and he didn 't meet him until he turned 11. and the return of the father had some quite profound effects on their small family he uprooted them from where they had carved out quite a nice life at nambour on the sunshine coast a marichador in the sunshine coast to move them up into a fairly rugged wild country in queensland up uh west of um northwest of bundaberg where they lived quite an amazing very basic tough life out there in the bush i won 't talk about it too much because there 's an awful lot in the bush but dan grew up for the first 10 years of his life without a father and even during his teenage years with the father who he had a lot of troubles with and without giving away too much of the story was certainly a far less than ideal role model but he was lucky because he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his grandfather who had served as a soldier in the second world war who instilled with him certain traits that he needed to get through his teen years and to give him some direction in life and so the book is not just about what happened in afghanistan but about the whole process of a young man 's coming to age in a really difficult environment now if you 're not familiar with dan 's story i do encourage you to read it because he was awarded the victoria cross during the battle of derepet for repeatedly exposing himself deliberately to enemy fire first of all in order to pinpoint the positions of taylor of a very large taliban force that has his small force of australians and afghan soldiers pinned down in the later parts of the battle he once more exposed himself to fire to draw attention away from the evacuation of a wounded colleague a guy who was actually a friend of dan 's it 's a very moving story courage under fire it 's released next week october 27th it 's going to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have plenty of copies on order i was going to say for the man in your life but it 's not i think it 's a book that would resonate with with with everyone young and old families it 's a story as much about growing up as it is about a particular moment in time and personally i got to know dan he 's a great guy he 's a really inspirational guy who speaks quite candidly about the pressures that come with receiving the nation 's highest award favela turning him from being a very private person into a public person and the challenges that that come with that but also the way that he was able to i think perhaps use that award as as the impetus for taking a new direction in his life and for achieving things that he might not have been able to achieve if he 'd had a different background so i can i 'm not going to recommend it because i wrote it i 'm going to recommend him because he 's an amazing guy and it 's an incredible story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one as well um just seeing what else i 've got here is melissa has said that [Music] she 's struggled to read last survivor due to cover 19 and what her friends who live in zimbabwe and south africa have been going through but she loves the book yeah i think the um the one thing to i think something that traveling in africa and living in africa has brought home to me is that the um we 're we 're all in this together as they say and it 's affected all of us in some ways but it certainly affected other places and other people and other countries a lot i think a lot harder than it has in australia i 'm not trying to downplay what 's happened in australia but i 've been keeping an eye on the news in south africa and people are doing it particularly tough particularly because they don 't have the same levels of support that we 've been lucky enough to have in australia but the interesting thing that i 've also been watching and noticing in other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that people are rallying to help each other as well we 've seen that in australia but we 've seen it in south africa i think even more importantly because it 's even more needed this sense of community and this need for us to come together so hopefully if there are other good things to come out of this time other than increasing book sales it 's it 's it 's an understanding of the importance of community and it and the value of something that i 've been keen to talk about in previous talks that i 've i 've given about books and about my travels in africa is the incredible resilience of people and that thing called the um the the the unidentifiable unquantifiable essence of life the human spirit you know the ability of good people to come together in the time of crisis whether it 's a pandemic whether it 's a bush fire whether it 's in terms of strife or political issues poverty the ability of good people to come together at grassroots to find solutions to problems and i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about africa and the problems of poaching whether it be plants becoming extinct or animals becoming extinct or corruption or crime or political mismanagement it can be very easy to be dragged down and just focus on the negatives but when i start to feel that way in my writing i don 't have to look very far or think very far to remember examples of the indomitable human spirit and good people coming together the grassroots village level often to find solutions to some of these problems that people that people have it was interesting doing some of the research for last survivor which is about in many ways the extinction of these particularly valuable particularly unusual unique south african plants these particular breeds of psychos you can look at the stats and look at the decline in populations and you can be terribly disenchanted and think that this is just a no-win situation even people working at the coal face to conserve and protect these plants can get quite down about it when i was doing the research i was involved in fact just after the book came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangered plants and listened to a very interesting presentation about wildflowers in south africa which also disappeared at a great rate but using what they call these days citizen scientists ordinary people to work hand in hand with qualified botanists and researchers and scientists they 've begun mapping out and investigating certain areas of south africa in this particular case in the last several years they 've discovered about 15 species of wildflowers that were actually thought to be extinct and so it goes to show i think that there is a ray of hope always when people come together as i said often at the grassroots level at the ordinary human being level to work together to try and find solutions to these terrible problems that that confront us a couple other questions come in do i choose the title of the book and what makes it catch the prospective reader do you pick the title or is that done in consultation with the publisher um so i think that 's from uh from beth nigel had asked the last question sorry um i got a um an email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment it 's called book 19. okay that partially answers the question this is called book 19. and my publisher asked me to send her a synopsis to let her know it 's about and she said in her email she said you can have a go at writing the title but i expect to reject it and sure enough she did i thought of a couple of titles we have a running joke my publisher and i that i have been unable to ever pick the title of one of my books i think i 've done two i think zambezi i picked uh the name of and i think safari and a name baby the only two and i think probably in the case of safari i [Music] i kind of prompted her and i made her think it was her idea i hope she 's not watching this but anyway so i don 't um i i i i got an email from someone the other day saying i want to write a book and i 've already thought of the title and the first thing i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that think about writing concert your job as the writer is to concentrate on writing the book okay titles are very very fluid things they 're changed sometimes they 're changed at the last minute i 've had a few books where we 've had what you might call a working title and we 've got as far as having the cover designed and then the publishers will show the cover to their sales force and someone will say i don 't like the title and they 'll say why and they 'll give their reasons at the last minute the title can actually change so yes it is something there 's a bit of a science behind it i don 't know what the science is but i do know that i am incapable of picking the titles for my book pretty much another question we 've got here what 'd you find was the best part about co-writing your non-fiction and what was the most challenging fantastic oh okay that 's a really really good question what i like about co-writing someone else 's stories is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum up the difference between fiction and non-fiction and this gets back to sandy 's question which is very overarching um for me to personally the difference between fiction and non-fiction i 'll sum it up quite quite simply this is my passion you know i could do this for fun right and if i wasn 't getting published for larry and all the other writers out there either who 've either published books or made a name for themselves i hope you might agree with me that you would probably write anyway for fun i 'm sure i would i was writing long before i got published i had that first manuscript but before that i had many many many many attempts at when i got maybe a chapter or two chapters into a book but while i probably knew that i was just experimenting i was still writing for fun this is my passion and this is probably the best job in the world if i could think of the ideal job where i would have to go to work it probably wouldn 't be journalism i i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but after a few years i had kind of worked out that it probably wasn 't for me in the long term and and i think probably because i wasn 't that good at it and i 'll say not that good at it i don 't want to say i 'm immodest or modest or whatever i loved writing i and i still do it 's it 's my passion um i don 't think i was a very good reporter i i don 't think i had the instincts or the aggression or that kind of foot in the door mentality to pursue and dig and maybe even harass you know to get a story i was not a foot in the door man i was nearly going to be on a current affair and probably never be on the daily telegraph or the or the courier male it 's not to say there 's anything wrong with those jobs but it takes a certain skill set i liked writing so unless i could find a job as a feature writer which were even harder to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i had to find something else but if i could combine the things i loved about being a journalist they were learning about new things each of the non-fiction books i 've done i 've met incredible people shane an ordinary guy doing an extraordinary job daniel a guy with this most amazing troubled childhood who just turns his whole life around these are fascinating people and what i used to like about being a journalist was was meeting interesting people and and so that 's the best thing about it i mean it 's in covering uncovering new stories and learning new things and meeting amazing people because all of the people i 've done books on have been amazing and unique in their own particular way the big challenge um is is um i think the challenge in any non-fiction writing but particularly in co-writing is that you you you want to aim to be able to to work very well with the person that you 're doing and i have done with all the books i 've written and to capture their voice as they say so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way that they would tell their story uh i i don 't want to downplay my job or what i do but i would say in some respects dan 's book was a very easy book for me to write because he has a very good way of telling a story he 's like a real um uh he 's an aussie soldier like a lot of soldiers that i 've got to know and a lot of soldiers are pretty good at telling a good yarn and daniel is an articulate man who 's able to tell his story very well and and that made my job a lot easier sometimes you have to work a little a little harder at it sometimes people are maybe a little closed a little reticent um but that 's just part of who they are and i think in some way you have to capture that so yeah i think that is the that is the challenge in in that type of writing yeah larry 's just made a comment which i think touches on some of the stuff that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself writing for a market is hard work and so the advice i would give to anybody who 's interested in writing is write for yourself i i do um and some people like my books and some people don 't like my books and it kind of i won 't say it irks me i get lot of great feedback a little get a lot of really good feedback but sometimes i 'll be at a book launch or someone will send me an email and say you know you should have done this and i said well it 's too late the book 's published it 's out there and you know what i like the book in the end because i was writing it for myself you know if someone else likes it i think that 's a bonus it might sound a bit selfish but i think if i was sitting at home here writing my next book thinking now what would someone in england think if i wrote this that 's not coming from me that 's me trying to second second-guess the market or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest with with myself it 's not to say that i don 't have to check myself it 's not to say that i don 't have to check some of my personal views at the door when i start writing it 's not to say that i should be unmindful of readers and their sensibilities and sensitivities but i think at the end of the day if i 'm not entertaining myself if i 'm not enjoying the process as sure as eggs no one else is going to want to he 's going to want to read this stuff as well too so i wanted to give you that little bit of an insight into into the whole job the other interesting thing for me that i 've learned over the years is and this may be of interest to people who are interested in writing is there are basically as i have subsequently learned since that first attempt two ways to write a book you can either structure it with a plot where you know the beginning and the middle and the end before you start it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you flesh it out and work towards this ending that you know about or you can make it up as you go along it 's actually there 's a word for it it 's called pantsing i think it 's a bit of a silly word but it means to write by the seat of your pants so i am a pantser right i mean i make it up as i go along so that 's the two ways to write a book so i write a novel last survivor i wrote exactly the same as the first book i made it up as i went along all i knew was that i was going to write a book about plants cycads and that this book would start in all places in london even though it 's set in africa because i happened to be in the uk with my wife when i was time for me to start another book so the book happens to start in the uk where the terrorist attack why because that 's where i was and i just made up the characters and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not knowing until the very end who the bad is so if you 've read this book and you didn 't know who the daddy was until the end good because neither did i and neither did my wife funnily enough so i 'm getting better at fooling her as i go along so i i write by the seat of my pants when i 'm writing fiction when i 'm writing non-fiction war dogs or dan 's story carriage under fire i do have a plot because i know this is a true story i know these people 's lives or they know their lives as they are at that particular point in time and so we 're able to map it out and have a more structured approach and i think that is a good way to write non-fiction because it not only keeps me on track while i 'm writing but it keeps me and the subject of the non-fiction book on track when we 're in the process of doing the interviews and the research and the preparation for writing the book otherwise it can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so when i 'm interviewing someone to write their life story i go in there working having worked with them first to map out basically the order of the book and what is going to to um to eventuate in in the story some of the books the non-fiction books that i write i 've been commissioned to write by a publisher and that was the case with courage under fire daniel 's books in other cases people have either approached me or i 've approached them as was the case with war dogs and we 've taken our idea to a publisher and the publisher has agreed to publish the book for us so there 's a couple of different ways of going about business of fiction and non-fiction so this has been a busy year for me two books two brand new books last survivor available from the ken 's bookstore courage under fire available from the cairns book and also as if i wasn 't busy enough because i had kept myself busy during the covert period shane and i were able to re-release an expanded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my favorite non-fiction books one of the things that the thing i like about these these two guys shane bryant and daniel kieran is that these are ordinary australians who have done in their own particular way each of them extraordinary things if you 're a military person or got a military background the other thing i 'd like to point out about dan 's book is that dan is our only non-special forces soldier from the war in afghanistan to have been awarded the victoria cross and is the only member of the royal australian regiment our main regular army infantry regiment to have received a vc while serving in the regiment he was a member of the sixth battalion of the royal australian regiment the significance of that to me as an ex-military person is that dan was a guy who had received pretty much the same training that i had received when i joined the army at the age of 17. and it 's it 's good and inspiring to know that someone from as you 'll see in the book a very humble beginning uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who joined the australian army or the australian defense force he had had quite a bit of experience prior to his second tour in afghanistan he 'd already been to afghanistan and iraq but he was kind of one of us one of the ordinary guys who did something really extraordinary so for that reason alone i would commend them to you to see and wardocks to see how ordinary australians have been able to achieve some pretty extraordinary things if i 'm going to put a plug in for last survivor just before i i wrap up it would probably be that if you think something is ordinary or maybe not of particular interest to you um something like a plant uh it might pay just to have another think about it another look about the importance of everything in the natural world in which we live as someone who loves traveling to africa and has spent half his life traveling in africa i have certainly focused a lot of my attention and my writing and my interest on megafauna on things like rhinos and lions and elephants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conserving yet all the while that i 've been living and traveling in africa these incredible plants a vital important part of the natural environment that has been around since the jurassic area era have been rapidly disappearing due to human greed and that 's been happening on our watch while we 've been trying to save some of these big impressive animals and equally important in its own way part of the natural environment has been degraded and so i think it 's important when you look at things like the natural world and the environment which is something i 've become very passionate about in the course of writing and living and traveling in africa and australia is is don 't forget the little stuff as well too what you might think is little stuff because it plays a crucial role in protecting a natural well-balanced healthy ecosystem that 's my little bit of philosophy i think for the day if i don 't have any more questions i 'm going to wrap it up and i 'm going to wrap it up by saying thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk at the library because remember as i said earlier this was going to be the very first talk on my round australia tour to promote last survivor and through no fault of their owns cairns library was probably the first ones to cancel i think because very early on when we were all in lockdown they knew it wasn 't going to happen back there in july but thank you for your support of australian authors if you 're one of my australian readers please i hope that you realize how lucky we are having such a fantastic public library network around our country it 's the envy of many many parts of the world to have such a well-resourced and progressive communally based organization as we do with our libraries there 's an interesting point of view i 'm sometimes asked is it a problem if i borrow your book from a library no it 's not a problem because in australia authors are given some compensation for based on the number of estimated borrowings of their books from public libraries under a scheme called the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Australia about 80 million years ago this left Australia and Antarctica United until about 50 million years ago while Antarctica remained at the same latitude Australia travelled alone northwards for 30 million years spend a couple of minutes here familiarizing yourself with the movement of the Earth 's landmasses then step back thousands of years to your first stop on our evolution trail life begins about 3500 million years ago life began from down in the cool depths of the oceans protected from harsh solar radiation simple single-celled organisms emerged from these simple bacteria like organisms evolved the first photosynthetic life-forms among them the cyanobacteria or blue-green algae using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carbon dioxide to sugar this process called photosynthesis produces a byproduct oxygen over a long period of time the oxygen produced by the primitive cyanobacteria escaped into the Earth 's atmosphere creating air capable of supporting life above water and a protective layer of ozone screening the Earth 's surface from the damaging rays of the Sun stromatolites relatives of these three thousand five hundred million year old life forms can be found today in the warm shallow waters of magnetic island off the coast of Townsville and Shark Bay in Western Australia plants move onto the land by the time plants moved on to the land around 420 million years ago the supercontinent Pangea was forming and many changes had occurred in the oceans multi-celled organisms had evolved including shellfish and primitive fish followed by the hard-shelled slater looking trial abides the first land dwelling photosynthetic organisms were most likely algae and lichens liverworts and mosses evolved from green algae and are considered the first true land plan liverworts and mosses are simple plants lacking true leaves roots or cells that transport nutrients and water they have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive characteristics limit them to survival only in damp areas if you look carefully around zone 2 you will see today 's incarnation of these simple plants growing on rocks and the trunks of the surrounding trees the age of the ferns by the time ferns arrived around 360 million years ago Pangaea was well and truly established and insects and amphibians had appeared ferns were an evolutionary step ahead of their predecessors the mosses and lichens although they still dispersed by spore and liked flowers and fruit they had true roots leaves and vessels these advanced characteristics allowed ferns to grow above their more primitive relatives and to colonize drier areas like mosses and liverworts ferns still needed water to reproduce their sperm had to swim to the female reproductive parts to facilitate fertilization the tree fern to your left is the scaly tree fern this is probably the most commonly grown tree fern in Australia the scaly tree fern can reach up to 12 metres in height which isn 't bad for a fern what is even more remarkable is that the trunk is actually made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fern those massive fronds can reach up to 6 metres in length and a held erect by water pressure should the ground dry out too much the fronds will droop and the fern will eventually die in the wild you will normally encounter the king fern growing very close to creeks and rivers the age of the Joo no sperms the cycads the gymnosperms or naked seed plants appeared around 318 million years ago well before dinosaurs walked the earth the conifers were the first of the gymnosperms to appear followed by the cycads some 40 million years later you may wonder why the cycads are planted before the conifers in this garden several of the cycad species used in this display prefer the moist shaded conditions where zone 4 is located the gymnosperms were the first true seed plants and a significant step in their evolution seeds protected the embryonic plant allowing it to be dispersed without drying out and provided it with nutrients in its early stages giving it much greater chance of survival the plant in front of you is called the zanier fern even though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cycad is regarded as one of the smallest usually not growing much more than a metre in height all parts of this plant are believed to be toxic despite this the local Aboriginal people used to eat the seed after much treatment behind you you will see several larger cycads hope cycad is another local plant that grows in protected gullies up to 20 metres in height making it the world 's tallest cycad there are several very tall specimens of Hope cycad along the blue arrow trail on Mount Whitfield on your way up to zone 5 keep a lookout for the cyclists a local cycad from drier areas the age of the gymnosperms the conifers another advantage that the gymnosperms had over more primitive plants was that they no longer needed water for fertilization to occur pollen evolved to replace this need and allowed fertilization to take place across great distances the combination of seeds and pollen saw gymnosperms dominate the landscape for nearly 200 million years during the same time that the dinosaurs roamed the earth it was during this time that Pangaea began breaking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two mighty land masses slowly drifted apart taking their living cargo of primitive plants with them the Wet Tropics is home to some spectacular conifers more commonly known as pine trees of them the calories are the grandest they were nearly harvested to extinction in our early colonial days the timber was valued mostly for furniture and musical instruments as you proceed down the path the three larger trees on the left hand side are the smooth bark carry the bull carry and the black carry on the right-hand side of the path is a selection of Wet Tropics conifers including the black pine and brown pine these are sometimes called broad-leaved pines however bird leaves are actually flattened branchlets the age of the angiosperms the flowering plants the final major evolutionary step taken by the plant kingdom was the development of flowers and fruit this occurred around 135 million years ago when Gondwana was breaking up into the continents the we 're familiar with today by now mammals and birds had joined life on earth flowers made angiosperm pollination more efficient than that of their ancestors they evolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry pollen from flower to flower in their search for food in contrast the pines shared large amounts of pollen relying on the wind and chance that it would find a female cone to pollinate fruit protected the developing seeds and improved the efficiency of dispersing them seeds were dispensed after animals had eaten the fruit or the seeds developed wing like structures to be carried by the wind or floatation devices to be dispersed by water the Wet Tropics is home to many primitive flowering plant species that still exhibit ancient features in this zone you will find many examples of these plants as you walk around keep a lookout for these unusual flowers they are often small and difficult to see continental collision and the age of exchange around 15 million years ago Australia New Guinea and Southeast Asia collided with a part of the northern hemisphere landmass this contact was short-lived but lasted long enough for an exchange of flora to take place some relatives of the plants from that exchange are still living in the Wet Tropics today a selection of them has been planted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York fan palm some of Australia 's flora moved to

footbridge over the freshwater lakes spillway when you arrive restart the audio mangrove nursery from the bridge you will see that a causeway has been built to create freshwater lake on the saltwater creek side of the bridge but tides under the influence of the moon gently rise and fall except during the wet season when the creek becomes a turbulent torrent with large tides and monsoonal runoff this is the home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saltwater crocodile here among the mangroves they silently hunt barramundi and mud crabs mangroves are highly productive plants and support many consumers in fact it has been estimated that 75% of commercially caught fish and prawns in Australia depend on mangroves at some stage in their lives mangroves are nurseries for king prawns barramundi snapper brim and mackerel small non-commercial fish that use mangroves during their juvenile stages become food for larger species when they move out into the ocean some particularly tasty seafood such as mud crabs spend most of their lives in the mangroves the mangroves also perform some less obvious functions during the wet season they filter sediment and nutrients from storm runoff limiting damage to the center of corals of the Great Barrier Reef during cyclones low pressure can cause sea levels to rise creating a storm surge of water onto the land mangroves buffer this influx of water helping to reduce the impact of flooding and landslides a home for many freshwater lake is a nutrient rich habitat that supports abundant aquatic plant life such as water lilies the white and pink water lilies grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lotus provide a habitat for many birds ducks cormorants kingfishers egrets and magpie geese or find this a perfect environment for breeding and feeding beneath the water eels turtles and snake head gudgeons are abundant gudgeons are bottom-dwelling fish that feed on small invertebrates you might even see a turtle pop up among the lily pads if you stay quiet for a moment unfortunately exotic fish have also found their way into these waters and one such prolific breeder the tilapia is now competing with our native fish population there is also a constant battle to control exotic weeds including the highly invasive salvinia that flourish in our nutrient-rich freshwater flanking freshwater lake the surrounding habitat of freshwater lake showcase is a very diverse collection of palms and native trees look for the red beach also known as the golden Guinea tree have a close look at the bark on this tree it flakes and peels off to reveal a reddish underside that gives rise to its name red Beach the flowers are bright yellow and when pollinated and mature reopen to form a rich white fruit this makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves you 'll find this tree in low-lying areas of our northern swamp forests atalaya or Cahoon pom is a majestic and very useful native of the Amazon Valley the palms huge fronds are used for thatching and building material and the trunk yields hard durable timber the seed is edible however the nut is extremely hard and requires a very strong whack to open flowering once in a lifetime as you walk around the lake you will see several examples of a huge fan palm called the candy palm take a look at one of the smaller samples you will notice a vicious sawtooth edge to the palm frond where it connects to the trunk certainly a deterrent for several palm climbing animals this palm has the unfortunate characteristic of dying after it flowers which might take 40 years of growth when it does flower it 's inflorescence which is a stem of flowers is one of the largest in the plant kingdom when all these flowers are pollinated they then produce thousands of fruits that are hungrily devoured by Torres Strait pigeons who migrate all the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cape York Peninsula here the seeds are spread by the monsoonal floods and settle in the rich silt to germinate and continue their lifecycle coconut look out look towards the lake and you should see coconuts overhanging the lake and mature fruit floating on the water fresh water lake is one of the few places in Cannes where you will see the actual mature coconuts allowed to remain and grow they are removed in all other parks and gardens for safety reasons ouch here the coconuts can fall safely into the water as they would naturally do along the coast of tropical regions of the world coconuts can float for several months and then germinate when washed ashore this has enabled the coconut palm to be widely distributed throughout the world the coconut palm is also known as the tree of life as it provides a regular food supply in many cultures this is also a reason for its widespread popularity this fruit can be consumed when the outer case is brown and mature or when under ripe and green providing a refreshing drink before the delicious white flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coconut man the heart of most palms including the coconut palm can be eaten unfortunately to harvest the heart the palm must be cut down this kills the palm if it is a single trunk species this does not happen if the palm has multiple trunks and certain species are cultivated for this purpose the heart has a crunchy texture and many palms have been given the name cabbage palm because of this the heart is also used to make millionaires salad why such a name well maybe you have to be a millionaire to kill a palm tree just to make a salad a divine view looking out into the lake you will see the Lotus lily pad standing high above the water the Lotus is one of the world 's most celebrated flowers being part of folklore and art in some form or another and as a divine symbol in the religions of many Asian countries the plant was cultivated in 12th century BC China and is still an important commercial crop in some parts of China today in the warm months the Lotus will dominate parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as being widespread in Asia the Lotus also occurs naturally in Billabong 's up in Cape York did you know that the seeds from the Lotus plant are edible the lotus nuts are a common ingredient in Chinese desserts and medicine in South America the nuts are eaten raw as a snack growing sideways now look for the nepa palm and other unique native that grows straight in the water it is more commonly found in tropical saltwater estuaries and is the only palm that is sometimes considered a mangrove this poem actually has a horizontal underground trunk and only the fronds grow upwards this gives the impression that the palm is slowly moving sideways as it grows the huge round fruiting bodies hang low in the water and when ripe will fall apart and float away not only does the seed float like a coconut it is also edible the immature seeds are coaxed open to reveal white highly nutritious jelly like flesh like many palms the flower store can be cut and the rich sugary SAP collected and fermented to produce alcohol and vinegar fossilized nepa palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million years ago have been found in clay in London indicating that England once enjoyed a much warmer climate than it does today bird City freshwater lake in a surrounding habitat

endangered birds a complete list is available at the Visitor Centre and includes wader Birds predator birds shallow and deep divers small honeyeaters and large noisy parrots some of the birds you see here migrate between you Guinea and Australia and sync with the wet and dry seasons the lake is particularly popular during the dry when inland waterways evaporate around November at the end of the dry season keep an eye out for the black necked stalk also referred to as the jabiru they are distinctive with long red legs wide body black wings and a glossy bluish black iridescent neck and head if you are lucky you might see their courtship dance they step to and from each other fluttering their large wings and clattering their bills when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and cross the bridge to

Fletcher 's contribution to botany and the gardens today the Cannes Botanic Gardens includes centenary lakes rainforest boardwalk Beach cell and garden tanks Art Center and Mount Whitfield the gate he was standing under is a recent addition donated by the Friends of the gardens whose volunteer work contributes to the promotion and maintenance of what you see before years there is enough here to keep you coming back so enjoy your walk today and choose a different trail when you return the Monroe Martin fern house the fern re houses some of the stranger plants that can be found at the fletcher garden along with a couple of celebrities erodes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as you might expect they are arranged on a straight column like growth that is called a spadix which is usually partially enclosed in a bracht which is a modified leaf called a spade our celebrities are too Ariens called Amorphophallus titanum they have a spadix that can reach three meters in height making it the largest unbranched flower structure on earth these extraordinary flowers produce a rancid fetid odor that attracts just the right pollinators flies our celebrity roids are extremely difficult to coax into flower but both have done so recently take a few moments to enjoy the diversity of ferns before heading out some are related to ancient plants that existed here millions of years ago well before dinosaurs or even flowering plants did the George Watkins orchid house the your curd family is the largest of the plant families with an estimated 30,000 species dispersed through almost all regions on the planet in the orchid house only flowering specimens are displayed and are replaced as soon as the floral display concludes but you might find Queensland 's floral emblem the Cooktown orchid this popular purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees many orchids epiphytes and you will see several in the gardens and along the boardwalk if you look above you you will see picture plants or monkey cups these interesting climbers live in wet nutrient-poor soils where they supplement their diet with insects that they trap and just in their pictures the bromeliad garden bromeliads are a relatively small but diverse group of plants that originated in tropical America like the orchids most are epiphytes the best-known and most widely grown bromeliad is the pineapple the two Lancias are a subgroup of the bromeliads often called air plants look closely at the logs in front of you there are different species attached and they appear to live on air alone they actually collect moisture and nutrients from the surrounding atmosphere using special leaf structures if you look at the bromeliads growing on the ground you will see that they trap water in the base of their leaves like the two Lancias these plants do not take up water or nutrients with their roots it enters the plant through the leaves the foxtail palms although the foxtail palm was well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1981 until that time it had been mistaken for another North Queensland palm with a similar appearance the black palm the foxtail palm occurs naturally at Cape Melville a remote area of Queensland 475 kilometres north of Cairns it grows amongst granite boulders in harsh coastal conditions when first introduced to the commercial market it was very popular and individual seeds command at high prices however due to its ability to thrive in a wide variety of climates and produce large volumes of viable seed its value dropped today the foxtail palm can be found throughout the world which is remarkable considering its short time in the industry it is a marketing success story the aboriginal garden and african sausage tree the aboriginal plant use garden exhibits native plants that local rainforest Aboriginal people depended upon for survival there is a leaflet here to help you identify the various plants make your way to the sausage tree this tropical African native produces sausage shaped fruit that are usually popular with baboons elephants giraffes and hippopotami but are inedible and toxic to humans the large bell-shaped flowers secrete an enticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range the sausage tree was a popular medicinal plant and treated conditions such as constipation wounds sexually transmitted disease and skin cancer scientific studies have verified that the tree is indeed an effective anti-inflammatory antibiotic and anti-cancer treatment the South American rain tree our rain tree is over 100 years old and carries the scars of several cyclones the rain tree comes from the northern South American rainforests where their seed pods are sought-after by children for the sticky sweet pulp that occurs between the seeds there are several reasons why this plant is called a rain tree the leaves curl up on cloudy rainy days the grass is often greener under the tree than that which surrounds it SAP sucking insects can produce a fine drizzle of honey jus that can drip on you and flower petals fall like rain during peak flowering periods look up and look down is the grass greener is there a pretense of rain from falling petals or maybe you have to wait for a rainy day to watch the leaves curl the blue quondam this large fast-growing tree is a common sight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenery with its metallic blue fruit bright red discarded leaves and giant buttresses although it carries the same common name as the southern quondam tree the two are not closely related the fruit of the blue quondam can not be eaten unless really ripe and even then is not especially palatable cassowaries however relish the fruit as do fruit pigeons and other rainforest dwelling animals cassowaries can travel up to a kilometer before dispensing undigested seeds of the blue quondam ensuring that the trees are spread far and wide spices that shaped the world spices did indeed shape the world for example dried flower buds of the clove tree were once worth more than their weight in gold there are several members of the ginger family here including ginger itself galangal and turmeric whose fleshy rhizomes roots are used in cooking and cardamom whose seeds are used as a spice see if you can identify the three types of pepper we have growing here black pepper is the most widely used spice in the world however the other two species are quite popular for reasons other than enhancing the flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Guinea where it is used to enhance the effect of beetle nut chewing the leaves of the beetle pepper are used to roll a quid which is made with a thin sliver of beetle nut which is the nut of a palm and lime the combination produces a thick red liquid along with a feeling of well-being when chewed this euphoric feeling is behind the popularity of our third pepper the Carver pepper Carver is grown throughout Melanesia and Polynesia where it is both a ceremonial and social drink traditionally the drink was made by chewing the root of the Carver pepper and spitting the juice into a bowl these days it 's made by crushing the roots with water another vine growing here is vanilla although a climber vanilla is an orchid the Mexican plant depends upon native bees for pollination so when grown elsewhere it must be hand pollinated the entire process of producing vanilla is extremely labor-intensive resulting in high prices for each pod rainforest gully look out from this elevator position you can see into the gully that frames are ephemeral creak can you spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferns are unusual as they are composed of old frond bases and root fibers when grown in a protective position they can reach a height of 15 meters of the smaller ferns in the gully the strap leaved bird 's nest ferns are the most obvious these firms are usually epiphytic meaning that they grow on other plants while not actually taking any nutrient from them most of the climbers that you can see growing up the trees in the gully are are OIG 's you might spy some popular pop plant species here such as the green and gold leaves of the devil 's ivy are you surprised to see how big it can grow when left in its natural rainforest habitat the cannonball tree what a curious but apt name for this strange rainforest tree it produces large scented flowers and spherical fruit scientists believe the tree is bat pollinated although the flower lacks nectar which is usually the reason for an animal to be attracted once ripe the tops of the fruits fall off exposing hundreds of seeds so beware of falling cannonballs the tree is recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown in India for at least 3000 years which is on the other side of the world it is still unknown whether this is a second natural location for the tree or whether it was somehow introduced there the Seychelles stilt palm this remarkable palm is extremely popular with its undivided leaves spiny trunk and stilt roots it is very attractive and easy to identify although it is a tropical palm it has been grown successfully as far south as the mid-north coast of New South Wales only a few palms produce stilt roots like this that grow from the lower trunk into the ground those that do tend to be taller and have larger crowns for a given trunk diameter than other palms with more normal root systems there are several theories for the spiny trunk the most probable is that it is an adaptation to deter foraging primates the local primates are notorious for removing unripened fruits which prevents mature seeds from being dispersed the spiny trunk ensures the fruit is fully ripened before falling and becoming a primates meal gingers Heliconius and back scratches these three colorful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showy inflorescences an inflorescence is where the flowers form part of a compound structure however in many cases it is the colourful fleshy Brax that stand out bracts of modified leaves that surround flowers either for the protection of the flower or to advertise the flowers presence to pollinators the ginger family is widespread across the tropical regions of the world with the greatest diversity occurring in Southeast Asia gingers are grown for their flavorsome roots spectacular inflorescences and aroma members of this family include Beehive torch and Thai gingers it is not only their fleshy roots and spicy seeds that are used to flavor food the flower buds of the torch ginger are widely used in Southeast Asia to flavor seafood and vegetable dishes Heliconius have particularly showy Brax the plants however lack the aromatics found in the gingers for a long time the Heliconius were placed in the banana family Mousasi and only recently given their own family they 're grown for their floral display and there are several species in the garden ensuring summer in flower at all times of the year the backscratcher gingers occur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small group of only 16 species most of which come from New Guinea as you walk around the gardens you will see several plantings of our local backscratcher ginger Tappahannock kilos and an sa the tar tree beware of this tree it is one of our natives and is common in our local forests its name is a reminder of why we should keep our distance the tree produces a black corrosive SAP that is so strong it can remove paint from cars or chrome from metal and can cause severe skin reactions in some people in fact touching any part of this tree can cause ulcerations and blisters the fruit of the tar tree is very similar in appearance to its close relative the cashew both nuts need roasting to render them edible despite the risks the local Aboriginal people used to collect the fruit remove the nuts and roast them before enjoying a delicious meal three powerful palms these three palms are very important to the local inhabitants of their native countries on the right is the Buriti palm it comes from the Amazon and central Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brazil each palm is capable of producing around 5,000 edible fruits a year which can be juiced to make a sweet drink or fermented to make palm wine the leaves are used to such houses the next in line is the Caroline ivory nut palm the seeds of this palm have similar texture to ivory and are used as an ivory substitute for small carvings the trunk is also a source of sago an important starch in the diet of the South Sea Islanders lastly is the Seleka palm a native of Southeast Asia this spiky palm produces the delicious scale covered Sulekha fruit Timor black bamboo bamboo is the tallest grass in the world as a general rule tropical bamboos tend to grow in tight clumps whereas cooler climate species spread they all grow by rhizome which are underground runners Timor black bamboo is a large tropical clumping bamboos that can reach heights of over 20 metres it produces a black lustrous timber in Southeast Asia bamboo is probably the most important of all plants because it is the most useful it is used for construction scaffolding fencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also used in the manufacture of boats furniture and tools pandas eat it and so do we as bamboo shoots we hope you have enjoyed your botanic wander this completes your Flecker garden walk we hope you enjoyed learning a little bit more about what makes our habitat unique and worth conserving there 's more to explore such as the rainforest

a cyclone or storm when one aspect of a house structure is compromised then other parts may become vulnerable to further damage this is especially true in the case of roofing if the integrity of a roof is breached water can enter the roof space and in turn this can damage the ceiling sheeting electrical wiring and wall material okay with the air box test we 're trying to replicate the very high turbulence and high suction pressures that the edge of the roof is subjected to during a severe wind event um here at the cyclone testing station we break everything if we want to know how strong something is we break it so the fact that it 's actually looks like this at the completion of a test doesn 't mean it 's failed it just means we can work back from these loads and work out the most appropriate design criteria for this product to be used whether it be on the house in a suburban environment or if it 's got cyclone assemblies on be a house near the beach or on a hill during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a structure and the most frequently damaged but regular inspection by a building professional and maintenance of roofing components will reduce the risk of failure this is particularly the case for structures built in non-cyclone areas or for houses built in cyclone areas prior to 1980. what we have here is a boundary layer wind tunnel the wind tunnel is used to simulate the wind flow over the earth 's surface at a smaller scale at scales ranging from one is to fifty to one is to a thousand and then build models of a similar scale place it in on the turntable you see here measure pressures and use that information for designing better buildings how these forces impact a roof depends on where the house is situated geographically and the shape and strength of the roof houses on hilltops and hillsides especially those facing the sea are subjected to stronger winds than houses built on flat terrain houses located on unobstructed terrain such as on the edge of a large field are also exposed to stronger wind forces fundamental to secure roof construction in order to resist uplift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the foundation this is new construction in a semi-rural area in south east queensland the site is quite exposed so it probably has a wind classification of n3 or n4 that classification leads to quite a high design wind speed so you would have correspondingly quite high uplift loads as well as bracing loads that need to be resisted so if we just have a look at the critical tie-down chain in typical construction from the actual rafters and or trusses the uplift loads have to be transferred down through to the external wall frame connected to the top plate and then in this particular case we have a girder truss so we have a cyclone rod or a tie down right at the side of that girder truss connecting and tying those roof loads right through to the floor frame it 's the continuity of tie down from the roof sheeting through to batons to trusses to wall frames and right down to the foundations that is all important if these aspects of house construction are present then the potential for failure of the roof and roof frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a few items i 've noticed in in with your house as there are many older houses throughout queensland built before today 's standards you should seek the advice of a building professional if you 're concerned about any aspect of the construction of your home uh this house here is actually having its uh its roof replaced but since the uh the roof has come off it 's an opportune time to actually uh carry out some structural upgrades to the roof framing um so that is not only would the uh the roofing be um screwed down in accordance with the current requirements but um it makes sense to try and fix the existing roof framing down in accordance with the current requirements as well which would mean batten screwing the roof battens to the rafters and fixing the rafters to the top plate with either triple grips or straps or some other method of tire roofing especially should be inspected by a qualified building practitioner such as a building certifier structural engineer architect or builder with these older houses those built prior to about 1980 it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the necessary tie down in their roof area as is required by current building regulations and standards and it 's the tie down in the roof and from the roof to the wall frames it is the most critical part in ensuring a good safe structure in the event of high winds and and high uplift forces in terms of tie-down chains we 've obviously got the connection of the roofing itself to the roof battens and if we wanted to upgrade some of the tire down at these points we could use for example uh framing anchors or triple grips to connect that roof batten to the rafter or truss depending upon the particular case and you can use similar sorts of connectors that are readily available for for uh upgrading tying your roof battens to your to your rafters your rafters to your hitch hip boards and ridge boards and also your rafters down to your wall frames even if work does not require approval by a building certifier all licensed contractors should be aware of the building code and tie down requirements any work they undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it is important to engage a building professional with a bsa license door and window failure is common during a storm or cyclone if inadequately fixed to walls door and window fittings won 't hold up in a cyclone the sudden entry of strong winds then changes internal pressure and risks roof and wall failure within the different loads that could be on a structure it 's not only the wind load that we have to consider in this process if if you have like the the winds coming and pushing on the windward wall coming up over the roof giving very large suction pressures on the leading edge of the roof we can design our claddings for that there is another force that could be in there is that if there 's any wind-driven debris from yards that haven 't been cleaned up prior to a cyclone or a storm parts of a broken house bits of tree whatever that may come through and break a window punch your door open those are basically make a dominant opening we have this sudden internal pressure that enters into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's on the top of the roof which could double the load on that structure you can provide extra protection to windows and doors by having impact resistant debris screens fitted ensuring that door and window locks are strong enough to withstand the pressure of powerful winds for guttering to do its job in heavy rain it must be clear of leaves dirt and other obstructions otherwise the resulting backup can lead to water penetrating the roof and subsequently damaging the ceiling and walls as a homeowner it 's important to have gutters checked regularly and if there 's any obstruction have it cleared pressure caused by strong winds is a very common cause of garage door failure they can be pushed in or blown out causing the same consequences as the failure of windows and doors much of the damage to garage doors windows and doors is caused by airborne objects during a cyclone or storm the everyday objects in this yard can be transformed into flying debris that threaten all homes in the neighborhood trampolines playground equipment temporary shade shelters barbecues and other outdoor objects and equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie downs during cyclone or storm seasons loose branches and overhanging trees should be regularly cleared from a property to keep its cyclone and storm safe and it 's not only unsecured items and vegetation that pose a threat house attachments such as porch roofs whirlybirds carports lean to 's and screen enclosures can simply be torn off in strong winds this leaves the house open to further more serious damage and of course it creates more flying debris in the neighborhood during good weather it 's easy to underestimate the power of cyclonic winds so it 's important to maintain awareness about what 's in your yard ask yourself what kind of damage these things could do if they became airborne in this program we 've looked at some of the most common types of cyclone and storm damage to recap they are roofs being blown away in whole or in part damage to housing in exposed locations such as hills or sea frontages damage to ceilings and walls due to water ingress through roof doors windows vents etc doors and windows being blown open due to inadequate fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from water leakage and strong winds garage doors being blown in or out damage caused by flying debris from yards regular maintenance and attention to these areas will help reduce the risk of damage from strong winds anything that weakens houses such as rust rotten timber and loose fixings can make them vulnerable to cyclone and storm damage as a homeowner you can check the parts of your home that are most likely to fail during strong winds further information on the topics covered in this presentation can be obtained from these websites the building services authority has prepared a checklist for homeowners to assess their homes for cyclone and storm preparedness and the is your home prepared for a cyclone guide can be downloaded from the cyclone testing station website as a homeowner you have a responsibility to identify problems and initiate solutions to protect your home from damaging winds we may not be able to stop cyclones and storms but with some attention to inspections and maintenance we can reduce the impact they can have on our homes and our families you,"(-16.9203476, 145.7709529)"

boardwalk remember to look up and down and listen for the life of the swamp birds frogs feathers or fans forests are commonly classified by their ecology in this case swamp and their dominant tree species here it is palms in Far North Queensland we have two types of palm swamp forests those dominated by palms with feather shaped fronds and known as feather palm swamps and those that are dominated by palms with large round pleated fronds and called sand palm swamps if you look carefully you will see some fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around are you in a feather palm swamp or a fan palm swamp this is a feather palm swamp and occurs where drainage is restricted which causes the area to be seasonally flooded palm swamps were once common in the wet tropical lowlands but their high productive value was recognized soon after colonial arrival and these majestic swamp forests were transformed for agricultural use the Alexandr palm is the most common palm that you see here it grows to 20 meters in height and can reproduce at a prolific rate at ground level you will see a carpet of Alexandr palm seedlings these masses of seedlings prevent most other plants from germinating here life in a paperbark swamp you have now moved from the palm swamp to the paperbark swamp this area is wetter and can be flooded for up to six months of the year this is an important feature of paperbark swamp environments paperbark trees are a species of Melaleuca and have roots that can filter nutrients and contaminants from water before it flows into the sea melaleucas and not the early plants in a paperbark swamp you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the climbing mangrove fern that looks more like a flowering vine than a fern just like the palm swamps the paperbark swamps are another type of wetland that was converted into farmland during early colonial occupation swamps were perfect for agriculture but were uninviting places to build on due to their healthy populations of mosquitoes and midges which breed in the still swamp waters little insectivorous bats exploit this valuable food source that 's ate between a quarter and a third of their body weight in insects every night which can equate to as many as five thousand individuals so don 't complain about the insects our swamps would not be the same without our bats gripped by an umbrella look for a tree that has been surrounded by long tentacle-like roots at first glance you might think it is a strangler fig that has established itself on a paper bark tree the impressive cascade of roots actually belongs to another wet tropics epiphytic plant the umbrella tree epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants the umbrella tree here began live sometime ago when a bird deposited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years the seedling grew sending roots to the ground once the plant 's roots reached the earth the plant ceased being apathetic and with all the extra nutrients and water available from the soil began rapidly growing unlike strangler figs umbrella trees rarely kill the host plant so here the paper bug tree is safe locally the flowers and fruit of the umbrella tree are an important food source for birds and insects keep an eye out for seedlings of this tree germinating in strange places around Cairns in building gutters car vents or on telegraph poles this ability to germinate rapidly in all sorts of places enables the plant to thrive where it is not native further south garden escapees grow rampantly and have been declared weeds not only do they displace the native vegetation their aggressive route system can block drains and damaged paths and buildings strangled by a fig remember the story of the umbrella tree the strangler fig began life in much the same way a seed was deposited high in the paperbark tree figs need lots of light to grow successfully and you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level they use the host tree to shoot as high as they can even breaking through the canopy in search of light at the other end the strangler figs roots reach the ground and start to thicken and fuse together the roots encircle the host tree and over time cut off the water and nutrient flow in the trunk combined with the shading caused by the figs dominating canopy of leaves the host tree usually dies often after the host tree decomposes and falls to the ground the strangler fig can be left with a hollow trunk figs are one of the most important of the rainforest trees they fruit profusely and frequently and many rainforest dwelling animals depend upon them as a food source did you know that mighty strangler figs have very very tiny flowers they are made even more difficult to see by being totally enclosed in the fig fruit paperbark and pandan this area of paperbark swamp is dominated by pandanus and is called a Melaleuca pandan swamp forest swamp and ants can grow to 20 metres tall and can branch many times the swamp is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might even see some fish or turtles breaking the surface of the water pandanus and in particular this species of swamp pandan was important to the local aboriginal people small elongated seeds were extracted from the large pineapple like fruit and eaten the leaves provided fiber for weaving into baskets string and rope the swamp pandan is also important for swamp-dwelling birds the leaves are bordered with sharp thorns along the edges and below the midrib this offers nesting and roosting birds a measure of protection from predators thriving in mangrove mud mangroves are fascinating plants that thrive in a very harsh environment they grow in waterlogged oxygen deficient soils their roots are fully immersed in salt water at high tides and they must disperse their young on the tidal flows mangrove plants deal with salt in different ways most excluded to some degree at the roots additionally some mangroves store excess salt in the older leaves which eventually fall some species even have specialized glands on the leaves for excreting salt called salt glands as the salt is expelled it dries out leaving crystals on the leaves to overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have extensive root systems many mangrove plants have adapted their root systems to overcome the lack of oxygen in the mud by raising part of their roots above the surface these raised roots are called new metaphors the surfaces of new metaphors are covered with pores that allow air to enter and fill up spongy tissue found inside the roots the plant uses this stored air when the new metaphors are submerged by the rising tide Cannes has at least 24 species of mangroves

Australia",1174,in Queensland we know extreme weather all too well and the expected impacts of climate change means the frequency and severity of extreme weather events like cyclones and storms are expected to increase communities and industries must prepare for and adapt to the expected impacts of a changing climate and the adverse weather that it brings this presentation has been prepared in conjunction with the cyclone testing station the Building Services Authority timber Queensland and Emergency Management Queensland it highlights where cyclone and storm damage is most likely to occur on houses and outlines measures we can take to ensure our homes are better equipped to withstand extreme weather events for most of us our home is our most valuable asset it makes good sense to take all reasonable steps to ensure that our homes are able to face up to what nature can unleash cyclones and severe thunderstorms are two of the most common powerful weather events we experience in Queensland the associated strong winds can cause serious structural damage to homes and potentially cause injury or loss of life if your home receives damage to the roof walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further significant damage wind pressure alone when introduced through weak points in the house can cause the failure of other building elements that would otherwise have performed satisfactorily no building can be made completely cyclone and storm resistant but awareness and regular maintenance that complies with current building regulations will greatly reduce the risk of damage the coastal parts of Queensland from roughly Harvey Bay northwards 50 kilometres off the coast line there was an area which we call the cyclonic region under the the wind load standards and under that wind load standards there are a number of different wind classifications that can apply to building a house or any building throughout the state when a new house is being planned or designed the the building designer or the Builder would probably visit the site and make an assumption about the type of wind speed it 's more likely applicable to it hello I 'm from hot constructions what seems to be the problem well out the back loose guttering and I think there 's some water getting in there so lovely have a look at that okay would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to leave if they license it right thank you yep that looks fine okay regular inspection of your home maintenance and in some cases structural retrofitting will ensure it is prepared to withstand the forces that nature may unleash it is too late to take action once a cyclone or storm is on the way maintenance and repair work should be carried out well before the summer season good preparation before the event will mean a faster recovery after the event there 's some flashing issues that we 'd need to look at and of course we all need to risa cure the the gutter that the green part and then the valley gutter we might need to have a look at that in terms of the leakage the cyclone testing station attached to James Cook University in Townsville is Australia 's premier research establishment into the impact of cyclones and storms it has conducted extensive research into the causes of structural damage resulting from very strong winds at the cyclone testing station we 've been around since 1977 basically researching ways to make housing resist high wind forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those types areas we 're looking at trying to make sure our houses are secure and can can survive these events for their desired criteria so we 've got many different ways of looking at that we 've research into looking at so roofing in air chambers we 've got the wind tunnel that we can use to work out the design loads on structures and that goes and informs the building codes and and design standards let 's take a closer look at just how powerful cyclones and severe storms can be tropical cyclones usually occur between November and April in the past 50 years numerous cyclones and significant storm events have cost Queenslanders billions of dollars Cyclone movements are unpredictable but in any one season at least one Queensland coastal community can expect to be impacted by a cyclone or severe thunderstorm the tropical cyclones severity scale is a five category system based on the wind speed a cyclone generates the higher the expected wind speed the higher the cyclone intensity most of the Queensland coastline is a cyclonic wind region known as wind region see ball houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be designed and prepared to resist the effects of a mid category 4 cyclone on 20th of March 2006 tropical cyclone Larry made landfall close to Innis Vale in Far North Queensland as a category 4 cyclone wind gusts reached 230 kilometres an hour almost 1 billion dollars of damage was left in Larry 's wake but very strong wind speeds aren 't isolated to the cyclone throwing areas of the state in the southern parts of Queensland severe thunderstorms regularly caused damage to homes and property in severe storm cells wind can approach the same speed range as a low category 3 cyclone causing extensive damage to property person in everything 's flooding in Brisbane in 2008 the extreme damage caused by the gap storms is thought to have been caused by a microburst a localized severe downdraft which induces an outward horizontal boast of damaging wind at the peak of the storm wind speeds were estimated to be 160 kilometres an hour near the suburb of the gap just as in cyclones debris and unsecured objects caused significant damage when they became airborne although much smaller than cyclones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of insurance claims I think the gap storms in November our weight highlighted a couple of issues that builders designers and certifies should be aware of and that is firstly correct site classification following the studies of the damage after those storms a number of sites were considered to have been underrated in terms of their wind classification which impacted app of course upon their inherent strength and hence leading to failures other things for for new construction the you know critical tie-down chain from the roofing right through to the foundation is the big issue you know if the tie-down is not right then it doesn 't matter what else has done there will be failures the lessons learned from events like cyclone Larry and the gap storms have resulted in changes to building standards if your house is an older construction it may not necessarily meet current building standards regular inspections combined with the retrofitting of components will go a long way to ensuring your home is as safe as possible,"(-16.9203476, 145.7709529)"

process of coagulation flocculation filtration and chlorination with liquid sodium hypochlorite the natural features of Cannes pristine catchments results in water that tends to be very soft with low alkalinity and this creates unique operational issues for Cannes Regional Council water and waste treatment at Tunnel Hill water treatment plant removes microorganisms and pathogens along with organics and particulates as per the national drinking water standards water is regularly tested at the Cannes Regional Council water and waste laboratory during different phases of collection

network into manageable water supply zones each zone covers between 500 and 1200 properties and allows for monitoring of daily demand assessment of non-revenue water and leakage monitoring as well as

water usage and discharge a uniquely critical issue for the Cannes region in response to this cannes regional council initiated under the states directive the 188 million dollar cleaner seas project resulting in extensive technological upgrades and investment into the region 's wastewater treatment infrastructure the upgraded treatment plants produced wastewater with at least five times less nitrogen and ten times less phosphorus than previously discharged significantly reducing the impact on the reef utilizing various different technologies and processes they can treat well over 100 mega

personal agendas political ambition and the capacity to wield power so that they might right here and now continue to prove faithful with the trust that has been given to them that they may continue to govern with diligence continue to be trustworthy leaders that they are for the sake of the region we all love lord i lift these men and women up to you now and i thank you for their god-given

concern over the size of the the crocodiles in question i think any crocodile in question around children around bus stops should be um taken very seriously thank you thank you council barnes any further business arising uh i have a couple here page eight at the um the possibility of heritage listing the igloo councilman would you raise that matter uh has that been taken back to their

nichta meadow and a number of representatives of state government from uh local government state development treasury and so on uh a little while ago since then um the uh the council 's team um has been meeting uh on a rapid-fire basis quite frankly with sometimes meeting daily with various representatives from the state government with skills in finance engineering law and uh and local government and uh i believe that we 're in a very sound position uh i can 't go into the exact details of it because these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well i think particularly the one that we had on monday established some excellent principles and ground drills which uh we 'll we 'll now be pursuing um with quite some vigor mr may so i 'm very optimistic and well i 'm more than optimistic i 'm very confident and i 'm very happy with the uh progress that we 've made mr me so thank you mr ceo um the 30-day title was placed on that plan by the state government so we 're on track i believe we 're on track now mr may okay thanks for that any further business arising through you mr may um mr goodman has been very active in those discussions uh mr goodman did you want to add anything to what i 've just said bearing in mind that we can 't no that 's about this okay thank you no further business arising we move on to item three governance environment and finance item 3.1 page 25 expressions of interest lgaq representative on the queensland heritage council and the ceo will present this report thanks mr mayor through you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh is calling for expressions of interest from uh councillors and elected members uh for uh representation on the queensland heritage council queensland heritage council was established pursuant to the heritage act in the early 90s and 92 i think and through you mr chairman the heritage council of course stewards the way that regulations and so on are applied to heritage buildings and heritage sites throughout the state it 's excuse me an initial term of three years but no more than no more than six years can be uh can be served uh and through you mr chairman it 's my recommendation that council uh appoint uh any counsellor who might be interested in representation on the uh council and as i understand it councillor chewie is quite interested in this position okay council chewie thank you yeah through you mr mayor yeah thank you mr ceo i have in fact sent my uh letter in yesterday it has been uh received and i 've had an acknowledgement of it being received so i just wait to see um if i 'm successful in taking that position but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would really enjoy reading the profile and it 's it would be exciting so thank you very much any other counselors interested council bones um through you mr chair i am still interested i did express an interest early i do only have to the closer business tomorrow i believe councillor chewie so councillor chile is going to provide me with some assistance today and get me over the line he drove along and that 's wonderful further to that mr mayor i would move the recommendation okay it 's moved by councillor mainz seconded by councillor pervin all in favor carried unanimously thank you we move on to item 3.2 page 28 the policy review on curbside refuge refuge collection and mr hammond will present this report mr hammer thank you mr mayor good morning councillors today i 've got a a review of the kerbside refuse collection policy services policy it 's a policy number ds002 it was adopted by council back in 2015 a review has been carried out just as a matter of good governance and in that review some changes have been made to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers changing the names of the department changing the legislation which reflected the contemporary legislation that deals with waste and the issue of the the the stealing of wheelie bins where we had a a statement in there that council would replace those bins uh that particular pole that particular line has been removed so if a bin is stolen it 's like anything else that 's stolen it 's the responsibility of the person who has control of that particular bin and in this case that would be the ratepayer who has that that bin so that 's been changed the um the maps at the back uh are still in two pieces and the the reason for that is the um the granularity of the maps is reduced if we put them into one map so the two maps are still there which will show very very clearly what the defined waste services areas are i 'm happy to take comments on that uh if there 's no comments i do recommend that council adopt the curbside refuse collection services policy updated council has any questions for mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr hammond i note in the policy there is there has been a piece written in around bin 's ought be put back uh in the 24 hour or within 24 hours because there has there is um quite a contentious issue that 's been going on uh in vleta 's estate for quite a few years will that allow our local laws officers some sort of scope or some of your other officers some sort of scope to control it so this uh thank you councillor um this particular policy is an intention of council 's uh view on how to deal with our waste that particular section you 're referring to is in state legislation as well which gives us the head of power to deal with that council jury yeah thank you mr hammond through you mr mayor just um just clarity on reading the report i think it 's really important that we try and i know we have recently on through our comms team they 'll work very hard uh letting people know how by putting their bins so close together it 's impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i want to go and fix them up um i posted a facebook page post last year and somebody referred to i 'll think of it like covert you know you 've got to be 1.5 meters apart i don 't know if there 's a line there but it just i just it 's it 's it 's difficult for the truck to get their hooks around the bins and i just think we really need to to work hard to let that know and also um for people that do require additional collections uh who do they do they ring customer service to arrange that yes so the answer to both your questions is the bin placement we can actually add that to our our media campaigns to make sure that message gets here i think the 1.5 thing is you know it 's in everybody 's head so maybe we should utilize that i don 't know it 's a valid comment counselor and the the second issue any odd any issue with waste uh waste bins should be directed to our customer service number councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a new waste calendar that 's should be out within the coming weeks which has a lot of that general information about bins and so if you 're wishing to get one of those you can also go to customer service where they will be available any further questions for the officer uh could you just elaborate on the cost of a big bin small bin replacement and what council is saving uh by changing the policy around the property owner being responsible for a stolen bin can you put that into context for us please as much as i would love to i don 't have that data um the what i can say is the um there is a number of complaints we get on a on a yearly basis around um bins that are stolen previously so at the moment before this recommendation is taken on board those comments are sent to the police and the police were telling me they had 32 outstanding complaints this is information that 's about 9 months old now there 's around about 32 outstanding complaints around stolen wheelie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's quite substantial for police resources to go and track down lost wheelie bins so that was one of the reasons and one of the reasons why we 've actually looked at taking that particular matter off thanks for that explanation any further questions mr hammond if not would somebody move the recommendation please councilman moved seconded by councillor barnes all in favor okay unanimously thank you thank you thank you mr hammond next item 3.3 page 42 finance report and mr smith will present this report uh councillors the finance report provides information on council 's year-to-date revenue and expenditure across all departments and programs uh it also includes financial statistical data which highlights council 's operations please note that the amounts in this report while they 're at the end of the year they are interim amounts at this point in time the finance team are currently finalizing end-of-year figures and those finalized figures will be included in the audited financial statements which will be available in october 2021 in line with audit milestones some of the key figures so operational revenue for the year was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure is that uh finished at 97.4 million dollars which is 761 000 over budget at the end of year cash balance was uh 43.5 million dollars and capital expenditure for the year was 46.3 million which represents 94 including commitments of the budget program the operating result for the year was a deficit of 1.3 million dollars on page 43 there 's a table showing a summary of the financial financial results for the year a list of the key variance explanations can be found on page 44 some of the major items in that is interest revenue was under budget due to lower than expected interest rates on investments operating grants also under budget due to emergent works reimbursements that have not yet been received these are expected to be recognized in the 2122 financial year operating contributions also under budget due to the state no state contribution for port henshin brook sewage maintenance and depreciation uh has been over budget mainly in the areas of water tangible asset sewerage and plant equipment details of council 's cash and investment holdings is at the bottom of page 44. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call at an interest rate of 0.6 council officers uh continue to look for maximizing returns in these low interest rate times so that 's continuing uh councillors the recommendation is that the report be received and noted i 'm happy to take any questions mr mayor any questions for mr smith if not but somebody moves the recommendation moved by councillor bain seconded by councilman millworth all in favor carried unanimously thank you thank you mr smith thank you great work thanks we now move on to item four asset sustainability item 4.1 page 57 ccrc capital report and mr smith will present this report thank you mr may uh councillors um at the in the 2021 year council had 352 capital projects with a total budget of 49.6 million dollars at that time of uh preparing of this report council had expended 44.8 million dollars of that budget uh which is approximately 90 of the delivery of the deliverable program uh as noted in the previous financial report uh end of year end of financial year accruals and journals are still being processed uh so as such uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh the final audited figures so be available in october as mentioned earlier some of the projects that were completed since the last report are some energy efficiency upgrades there 's more figures more projects on page 59 so the paths path renewal at silkwood has been completed a number of drfa submissions were completed prior to the end of the year park furniture and playground equipment at various locations uh leachate management control systems at both sodders hill and tully landfill and some sewage scada upgrades or renewals at some of our pumping stations on page 60 the table with the major funding sources so if i just run through some of those with drfa um apart from upper dariji road all dfa submissions were physically complete they will still need to have their acquittals done before we receive the final amounts of funding for those the local roads and community infrastructure program is on track to be completed by the extension date of november r2r it 's a roadster recovery program was completed and acquitted and received during the year works for queensland a couple of rounds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been some extensions received for some community facilities and also caravan park programs within the within the works of queensland area um with the other projects that have been completed those costs are being finalized and final acquittals will be lodged uh in the in the coming months we have received additional tids funding for cowley beach and also clifford road recently the cowley beach has been received clifford road will in the amount of 447 thousand dollars will be lodged with tmr shortly uh double barrel creek bridge and anne road and alecki road intersections

and the bulgan reservoir and tully showground grandstands projects were completed during the year and all funding has been received for those so councillors the recommendation is that council received the report and acknowledge the status of the capital works projects managed by it happy to take any questions mr mayor uh questions from mr smith councillor pervin yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one probably more mr goodman um in relation to upper daryjee road it 's set down for end of september to be completed are we on track for this or do we look like going over up through the chair um council perv and yes it 's on on track for completion within the funding requirements end of september what stage are we currently at with that um the majority of the uh uh gravel is is in place now certainly the uh earthworks are complete this is uh slow down they 're a very uh significant um risk to the project was getting the uh tram line uh component in uh and that is all uh done so um there 's some additional uh completion of uh gravel in base gravel and seal and tidy up is what 's required on site thanks very much council millwood through the chair while we 've got you there mr goodman i 've got a question for you about schumann road at alaris [Music] what works have been completed at that road for this stage i i don 't have any information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do understand that there was

patronized they 're spending plenty of money every fortnight we 've got a box here and we go and get the receipts and staff tally it up so to the naysayers who said many times don 't accommodate the rv community because they don 't spend they definitely spend they 're terrific for our economy and uh and the park is an absolute um asset to kashmir coast being on can cut away no doubt any further questions for mr smith uh councillor pervin mr smith probably mr goodman again just in relation to the capitol report there the river drive caravan park has been completed i see it 's in it 's open and full steam ahead if you 've got any ideas on what sort of takings the uh caribbean park has taken since we 've been open again at all mr goodman that you could give us a quick rundown um through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been back open now for uh close to six weeks just over six weeks i 'll start again through the chair uh so yes i can confirm that river drive caravan park and this file has been open now for uh six weeks and the uh data that we have i had a look at it yesterday we have received uh just over twenty five thousand dollars in uh revenue from that from that site since opening so started off a little slow in the first week uh but it 's just been going very well since and anybody that 's driving past that uh facility in the last uh month would see us uh extremely well patronized council melbourne through the chair while we 're on that subject is there any line of sight to a date when the tully caravan park may open um so uh that um under the works for queensland extension that was one of the projects that was ex that was given an extension approval and the current deadline for that extension is september at this stage um mr goodman may want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh mr mcbride gave me an update this week and it is on track for completion uh in september any further questions for the officers if not would somebody move the recommendation please move by council chewie second by councillor baines by baines all in favor carried unanimously thank you thank you thank you item 4.2 page 73 revisions of the water supply and series customer charter and service standards and mr smart will present this report happy work today morning mr smart morning counsellors councillors this item is proposes to amend our customer charter we are obliged as a water service provider to maintain customer service standards the customer service standards are things that we have to report on annually and some of our customer service standards relate to response times to incidents and they reflect some of the important indicators such as water losses uh and um sewage blockages nuisances um they there 's no intent to change those customer service standards that we have to report on uh so there 's no obligation for us to advertise any changes uh the proposal here is just to tweak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh are part of that charter the elements that i 'm proposing to change in the charter some of them relate to the smart metering that we 've been introducing and uh i guess just some uh indication to rate payers at what point they will get a leak notice there 's also some discussion about the change to uh the trade waste policy uh a few years ago we introduced um a system whereby the the trade waste generator was issued with the permit but the charges remained with the owner uh and um the charter just needs to be amended to reflect some of that change there 's a couple of other things there the mention of the backflow prevention policy and i guess the last one is the um the introduction of the water supply scheme maps and reference to those also as part of a water service provider we have an obligation to maintain maps that rate players can see what areas we 're agreeing to service uh we have those in our drinking water quality management plan um but this is a more uh it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in our charter and it refers to the the plan they can then they can find it there there 's also a mention of the uh the sewer serviced area uh which we 're also obliged to keep maps of um as there 's no changes to our customer service standards um and it 's it 's just amendments to the charter the recommendations are that we adopt the changes to the charter it 's also recommended that we endorse the water service areas which are included as attachment to in the document and um yeah i don 't think there 's any other points that are particularly relevant once this is adopted it 'll go on our website and the the charter becomes our reference point it 's a reasonably significant document thank you mr smart any questions for the officer counselor chewie thank you mr smart it 's probably more for the ceo actually um in relation to customer service i had a lady who spent several hours on the phone on the emergency number to report a leak once it was notified through email our team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that it was the issue was with customer service she sat there and as did i when she reported it to me so i just don 't know i 'm hoping that we can improve that facility uh mr ceo especially as this lady was quite concerned about the water and the potential of charges and things like that thank you through mr chairman um thank you councillor chewie we are alive to the issue and it 's under review uh right now thank you any further questions for mr smart if not would somebody move the recommendation please move by council jewish second by council bourbon all in faber carried unanimously thank you we move on to item 4.3 page 112 asset rationalization proceed and uh mr acatino will present this report so yeah in front of you we have an update on our asset rationalization process so this is the our implementation update so we have been working uh really hard in this space and to progress the implementation of the asset rationalization in this report we have of the of the 32 assets that you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there a rationalization approach for 13 of these assets so we have uh progressed um the discussions with the user groups um obviously utilizing the the policies that you 've adopted for community use of assets and a lot of those discussions have been going really well and progressing [Music] making great progress so we have we have um a number of assets here and there has been a couple of changes in two instances from the original recommendation um that we adopted and um this was the tully girl guides and the marks park girl guide so we have um we have had great discussions and using those principles we have changed the recommended approach so we are offering a um a user agreement for those two clubs in the in their current buildings um as we 've discovered more information we 've talked to them and which is a great outcome we 're working with the groups and um coming up with good outcomes and um that allows them to demonstrate their um their commitments and their um and meeting those policies which is um is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas we also have had um discussions with um tmr the transport of main roads um in regards to rest area so this is an addition to our [Music] asset rationalization so it 's on page 115 of the report we have had discussions about transferring ownership of the assets at the rest parks which are our main roads we see them as a main road service and yet we have them as our assets in our register so the discussions have been that we will transfer ownership back to main roads and um and we will maintain them in accordance with our um our road maintenance policy that we have with them so um there will be a report coming to council soon in regards to that to um once all that work has concluded for a recommendation in the recommendation there is a typo um in there so we want to do a an amendment to the recommendation so as i said there are actually 13 assets that we are proposing so if i just read out the um what the change what we 're suggesting so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via tender or auction of the following assets so the demandable building marina lakes the old tully vic the cracker um silkwood tennis courts and buildings the employee housing innisfail fishing club mullins hall the tip burn building and toilet block um and this is our proviso that we have provided tully pickleball uh two-month extension to demonstrate their ability to commit to the community use of assets and the future use and pay and cover all liabilities um but if they cannot do that then it will uh we 're still proposing disposal via tender or auction um the tully gem club um and number two to support the establishment of leases or user agreements over the following assets the inner style men 's shed the marine kindergarten tully girl guides innisfail dance girl building and the the amendment is also marx park girl guides through you mr chairman uh mr goodman you authorise that uh recommendation are you supportive of the um amendment um through the chair yes i am thank you hey um any question for mr acatino councillor milward through the chair so i believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracker building and the igloo be removed from the list for further considerations as the community has expressed interest in these buildings an extension of time be granted for the groups to meet the required principles for the community to have the opportunity to apply for heritage listing for the igloo in saying this i fully support fully appreciate the work done by our asset team and would like to express that the only contact with me as a divisional counsellor has been with one group only further to that i can only take action on issues in the community for the community with the information provided to me by the community which has been very little to do with any of these issues thank you uh councilmember are you moving a motion yes i 'd like to move that those two be removed at this point mr mayor i 'd like to second that through you mr mia the the way that that would look um is that the recommendation would be rejected and council needs to record its reasons for rejection of the recommendation and then an alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces to it firstly that a resolution that the recommendation be rejected because of whatever the reasons are and then an alternative resolution installed councilman do you want to say something yeah just further too while we 're stepping onto this i believe that the um pickleball has already been mentioned in this recommendation so in effect you 're really only trying to add the cracker for consideration as well as an extension yes you 're not trying to add um the igloo back into it because it 's already there it 's already you did you mentioned the igloo yeah i did mention the equation that 's correct so it 's just a really so it 's really to give an extension of time for a bit more consideration from the community group so okay everybody understand to process the ceo 's outline we 'll put the recommendation to a vote all in favor we need a mover in a second we 'll move it is going to move another second down there no ceo said we 've got to deal with this one first will somebody move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to reject the recommendation at this point if that 's your intention yeah three missed you yep i 'll second that very emotionally so you 're moving to reject the recommendation that 's very emotional uh any further comments counsellors through mr chairman and i 'm assuming the reasons that you 're relying upon is in the narrative you provided earlier correct yeah okay in the community interest yes okay for further time to negotiate yeah okay um any further comments counsellors all in favor okay so now point of order do we then put another motion forward that 's fine councilman would you move your motion now please so i would like to move the motion that within the recommendation that the tully igloo and the cracker building be removed on a basis for further community consultation and consideration well to revisit it uh councillor baines has highlighted the eagle who 's already been given a reprieve so can you reword it to just the cracker please so can we just add i asked that in the community interest can we also add the cracker to the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations and more community interest thank you that 's been moved by council millwood second by councillor barnes any further comments counsellors all in favor carried unanimously thank

always emanates from the site if we receive a complaint council officers investigate that issue and then we conduct noise testing so what happens is that we get the operating of the business to basically operate the business as they would usually we go to all the sensitive receptors and we take noise levels from those receptors if they 're seen to be exceeding the death spells outlined in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of the business i 'd also note that when you 're doing those noise testing results you take into account a number of different things such as background noise and

conditions relating to the noise which you 've just spoken about thank you uh through the chair council build we have a number of different enforcement issues and and that we deal with on a on a daily basis through our work here um if it seemed to be the fact that the operator the business isn 't complying with their conditions we can issue a show called notice under the planning act and then we can go further enforcement through the planning environment court the reason why we face these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's a limited scale to to a low impact a low impact industry type of

thanks council julie for your question so we 've conditioned a bunded mound on one side of the two sides of the development um we didn 't condition it on the other side development because it faces

but that 's right um through the chair uh council base ask your question we have actually sent letters to the owners outlining um depending on what the decision is today moving forward that they 'll be responsible for cleaning up that site back to a state a satisfactory state what it was before so thank you thank you any further questions from mr jones hi councillor pervert yeah mr jay is just one more question in relation to the movement of the um the facility from one to the other will they continue to operate until the new one 's built so it could be some amount of time do you know at this point in time or have we sent enforcement out there to cease operations um through the chair council bourbon thanks for the question um they 're at the moment they 're operating on a very low scale they can 't bring any additional stuff in what they have at the moment so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um which have chased them up in regards to enforcement and compliance so they 're well aware of the fact that there 's no additional vehicles and that to be brought into the site at the moment and there will just be a transition period between moving things from that side to the other side councilman millwood through the chair this is this is just more a comment backing up on what counselor bain said i think this is a really good outcome for the young man and giving him the opportunity to be able to continue with his business while he is um doing his best bit for taking waste out of our landfill thank you any further questions mr jones uh just a compliment for the planning department this is actually the second recycling business that 's been relocated from that area across the road on rifle range road there was one at six years ago that was causing environmental issues and he 's acted swiftly uh relocated him to the old grundy mill site so this is actually the second business that 's going to be relocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome thank you any uh any further questions somebody moved the recommendation please counselor permanent move counselor chewie 's second all in favor carried unanimously thank you thank you we move on to it thanks mr jones thank you we move on to item 5.3 page 307 delegations report and mr horton will present this report welcome mr horton welcome council thanks mr mayor council good morning hope everyone 's well um council um the delegations report um to finish financial year as well as how are we in the first six months of our calendar year for planning council with 69 applications above last year for the financial year so um yeah still um progressing not too badly in that um fact for that council so planning 's pretty standard at the current time um on our dwelling approvals for the six month period from january to june we 're um up and we 're 39 above any of the previous five years council so we 're um we 've done 87 dwelling applications approvals i should say for the region which is nice to see so there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall um applications were at 286 for the six months um 85 above any of the previous five years council so overall for the month we had 44 approvals that we did 6.1 million dollars worth of work overall from january to june um the total of all approvals is 37.9 million council and dwelling total estimate is 24.3 million so there 's a lot um of approvals and a lot of money that are going into those approvals council so overall for the financial year from july to june for 2020 to 21 um for that financial our total estimated cost for all jobs is 40.4 million and for the year before was 13.9 so you can see the difference between the financial year of last year 1920 financial year to 2021 13.9 to 40.4 so overall for that financial year as well as in the total approvals we were up 124 approvals from last year in that financial year council approximately for the total um yeah approximately 22.9 million between um that financial year for our total dollar values on that um in council here which is 66.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year for our total approval so that one there is is the difference between our total 66.9 and 44.08 the one before was the financial year was dwelling sorry council i should have said that so the total dollar figure for dwellings was 40.4 compared to 13.9 the year financial year before so there 's a considerable increase there in that component apologise for that and i should explain that a lot better overall for the month we did 74 building inspections we did 32 plumbing and drainage inspections in our building records searches council for this year we 've done 231 in the first six months um 71 above 2020 and progressing nightly if we would understood back in 2019 when we had mayfair come to town and buy up a lot of the properties between august and october in that period we went from 152 to 300 so that was those couple of months so we 're 231 this time for june so there is some interest in our area in purchase of property changing hands rural properties right through to all of them council look i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council has any questions for mr horton councillor pervin yes mr horton um i just recently i think you attended some pre-start meetings for some operational um of sub-subdivisions that were beginning how did you go with them and are they under construction um through the chair um council pervin we have done a pre-start for over at innisfall estate um that will proceeding um once product and so forth is purchased um that will be proceeding as anytime soon and we do have a pre-start meeting next monday morning on another development down at mission beach for a third stage um so once we do that pre-start and get all the security bonds in place and um the guys order their material there 's a bit of a lag time and materials around especially concrete pipe work and storm water and sewer and those types of things so once that 's in place but definitely the earthworks can commence and yeah we 're working through with those two um developments at the current time uh it 's good to see mr horton as it 's been some time since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to see here some new areas for development in the nsl and wider community council milwaukee through the chair i believe you and your team should be commended on the great work happening in the planning department and welcome the work that is taking place in the changing of our planning scheme well done thank you thank you council millwood council chewie thank you mr may i 'd also like to acknowledge the work done by the planning scheme i think it 's very exciting i think the upcoming august census will be interesting to see what it reveals and what 's happening where just as a point of interest i mentioned it the other day one of the real estate agents at mission beach made comment and i 'll just use an example of figures that last year they sold 100 properties in 12 months and this year they sold 200 properties in six months and 14 of those were sight unseen so there 's definitely a shift to our area so as i said i think the census figures will be really interesting to see what uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further comment or questions i just wanted to say it 's a huge relief to see uh innerval estate underway i voted on the original development in 2005 has hit plenty of hurdles on the way i believe uh one of the catalysts for this to happen now was the decision by the previous council to approve uh work for queensland funding for the pump station the sewage issue was always a major hurdle to that development going forward so congratulations on on that decision by the previous council and i can 't wait to see the 11 lots get underway on opposite elt street yeah through the chair definitely mr mayor and hopefully it 's just a start hopefully from the 11 we 're going to the 48 across the road on the riverside and you know we 've still got another 600 there so hopefully we stage it out accordingly and um yeah we get the use of that 1.2 million that we spent on that pump station definitely it was well worth it and you know i know there 's been a lot of work especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director you know on flooding and drainage and those types of things and you know there 's been a lot of effort over you know 15 years of seeking to get where we are today okay any further commentary questions somebody moved the recommendation please move by council permanent second by council mill we 're all in favor it 's carried unanimously thank you thank you mr horton thanks council councillors we 're up to

signage what councillor chewie was um just reporting on there 's been many complaints to council but i just like to make people aware a lot of those signs on the highway are tmr signs and council cannot legally touch those signs but i know mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads to clear that problem also while i 've got mr sadler i know you 're passionate about the mountain bikes where are we in that space uh through the chair thanks deputy mayor for your question um the mountain biking uh project um which is uh in partnership with the state for cardwell the the pump um track and the other piece and a small length of trail and trailhead project is proceeding well um there has been some changes with our um contact officer or project officer with the state um and just working through that at the moment um but uh my understanding from the team is that we 're on on schedule to continue uh undertaking that project as as funded from the state and commonwealth government just to follow up on councillor barnes 's comment and question we 've been getting a mountain of emails from cardboard people saying that council 's walked away from this project you 're categorically denying that we 're on track and we 're working closely with all the stakeholders that that 's correct through the chair mr mayor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the uh the relief funding that came through um which was just short of half a million dollars to to do the trailhead and the pump track and a little bit of trial yes that 's exactly what we 've been telling the people that have been protesting but uh i guarantee you it 's been a mountain of uh email trail uh attacking us because we 've walked away and you 've just put that into clarity thank you any further general business yes mr meanwhile i 've got mr sadler i know you and i spoke recently about the great influx of um pigs that we 've seen with an extended wet season i know you 're onto it and you probably bring it to council in time just like to make um real landowners feel comfortable that the council is working with uh contractors and also the banana industry and cane industry in a combined along with yourself yeah look through the chair uh deputy mayor we continue to uh support our agribusinesses with pest management as we have in the past there has been some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um for panama tr-4 disease has come to an end we do have to do a debrief and close-up of that project yet and that will be in the very near future obviously i mean just finished as part of june 30. so um as uh i suppose this month and next month we 'll get the um project leaders together and uh obviously do that debrief and see what the learnings were but also all the great and celebrating the great work that that project did deliver on and lastly mr may my last one it was one of the most positive conversations this week i just happened to run into a couple people i know that are right up in the making of that new movie and um they spoke so highly of our council teams they rattled off names but i 'm not going to use those names in case i miss someone out i think they all know who they are from you know the planning to the asset to all the different teams and they said they 've worked with different councils around australia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this current council so that 's uh you can pat yourselves on the back for that thanks very much i think thank you against the advanced counsel and council milward so further to that i also have heard all good reports about the dealings with those companies and our council and it 's a it 's a credit to all of you guys and all the work that you 've done very well done thank you council perfect yeah just um mr saddler just touched on something i was going to cover in my next one um i was on the weekend i was up at milander having a look at the pump truck up there and my god the amount of kids that were there using at eight o 'clock on a saturday morning absolutely amazing um i 'd just like to put ask the ceo if he could take this on notice if i know our staff have been talking about pump tracks for quite some time as part of the marina lakes master plan there 's a scope for a scope for a pump track to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line and be the first step in implementing part of the master plan if we could have a bit of a talk to world trails and get our staff to just take on notice please to have some planning done around different parts of our region in relation to getting some pump tracks over the line thanks three mr chairman happy to uh to to get information back to cancel on exactly that issue for discussion it 'd be great if we could get some plans and maybe some costumes whatever yeah would be excellent thanks very much mr c through the chair uh mr ceo i believe that uh we obviously had the by-election on saturday and i think the formal declaration will be wednesday of next week can you provide any information or update obviously we can 't discuss names but just a closing and any information that you might be able to help with thank you through you mr chairman uh yeah we actually could discuss names because that 's in the public domain um so already um but uh yeah uh through mr chairman um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that mathematically it would be possible for two candidates to um to be elected the poll is capable of being declared anywhere during the 10 days after the election i suspect that it won 't be declared until the 10 days are over which takes us into about tuesday of next week i i think is that the 27th around the 27th we 're at wednesday um and um council is required immediately or not immediately councillors required after the poll is declared to hold a meeting such that the oath can be taken by the incoming councillor the councillor who is declared as having won the poll um can 't act as a counsellor until they 've been um put through that that process i expect that i 'll be calling a special meeting rather than letting it drag out to a general meeting and um uh the we 'll liaise with councillors to find out if their schedules are suitable such that a special meeting can be called very quickly after the declaration of the poll thank you mr senior eddie for the general business uh just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast is renowned for being a breeding ground for champion rugby league players and a big shout

@ @ @ move that we reopen to live stream in the vote moved by councillor chewie second by councillor barnes uh all in favor carried unanimously thank you over to the ceo with your with your permission mr mayor i 'll just note that the reason that those three reports were dealt with during closed session in the case of the first report with regards to cordless under debtors and outstanding rights it was deemed confidential pursuant to the regulations because it involved discussions relating to legal proceedings in the case of the second one sole supplier and suppliers of services of a specialised or confidential nature likewise under the regulation uh the matter was held in uh discussed in closed session uh because it related to negotiations relating to a commercial matter involving the local government and in case of the third one it was closed in so far as it related to council 's budget mr me thank you mr ceo we move on to item 7.1 page 330 the quarterly sundry debtor and outstanding rates and mrs vick will present this report this report was presented for council information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges to the 30th of june and also included um legal action um the recommendation is

thank you thank you we move on to item 7.2 page 335 sole supplier and supplier of services of a specialized or confidential nature and mr parish will present this report welcome through the chair good morning everybody the presentation today is council soul specialized and or confidential nature supply list the local government stipulates that council may enter into an agreement without first seeking other quotes or tenders if council resolves that there is only one supply recently available or if because of the services of the nature the nature of the services it will be impractical to seek other quotes in this year 's review we 've removed 34 supplies from the list and included 21 new suppliers this was done by comparing other exceptions in the local government regulations such as government agency suppliers contracted suppliers and suppliers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer our council of arms yeah just briefly it says the council will decide otherwise by resolution do councillors get informed of how you 're going with the process at all or is going to do all that in-house and then report back currently what happens is procurement pick up the previously approved supply list from the last year we we review that and then we circulate it to the internal users across the organization and then that list is reviewed for a second time by procurement and then it circulated to the cfo for review and endorsement prior to coming to council yeah mr mayor that was my question a council is on that list that gets circulated not sure what you mean sorry not sure what you mean well you said that then get circulated internally a council is on that list no it 's true to employees is it operational it 's operational any further questions yeah cancer milward yes through the chair miss parrish so i just wanted to make clear that of the ones that have been removed those possibly can still be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accessed by other exceptions which are listed in the local government thank you any further questions somebody moved the recommendation moved by council chewie seconded by councillor baines all in favor carried unanimously thank you thank you mr bush thank you move on to item 7.3 page 344 in-kind support innisfail and district show society tully and district chain society and mr ceo will present this report thank you very much mr mayor with your approval council staff members are going through a process whereby we are improving our practices in respect of trapping data around in-kind support and excuse me calculating the value of that in-kind support and subsequently reporting it to council this will continue as with the reflection of time and there will be data ventilated as to the value of in-kind support for community organizations and community events on a much more regular basis so this report deals with the innisfail and districts show society the tullian district show society my recommendation is that table attached to the report which provides a breakdown of the costings on the in-kind support i apologize it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just my eyes the totals though uh in respect of the innisfail show society provide for a total in kind support value of some fifteen thousand three hundred fifty six dollars and thirty five cents and the tully show society twenty three thousand seven hundred and twenty four dollars so it 's my recommendation that uh council confirm and endorse the provision of that in-kind support to those bodies any questions counsellors cancer not a question just uh gratitude that council do in fact support these events they are very uh important for our community and i think it 's great that council i also think it 's great that we are now recording so that the community can see what efforts um our teams do put in towards supporting the show so i think this is a great a great piece by everybody so thank you for that yeah i endorse those comments council chewie um we pay higher rates in catering coast and we often get approached by residents saying where does the rate money go why are we paying we need to show them where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put it out there it used to be hidden under in-kind well now it 's going to be hidden under a dollar sign i think it 's great work by our staff you know we talk about a lot of good things that don 't get communicated and we 've been told by other levels of government bobcat you 've got to get your communications better this is the best way to do it a perfect vehicle get rid of income tell them what it is in dollar terms uh would somebody move their recommendation please move by councilman millwood second by councillor chewie all in favor carried in and said thank you and i declare the meeting

councillor mccloud all in favor carried unanimously thank you thank you miss safran i just want to make a comment about our asset rationalization process that 's been underway for about 18 months now and tidying up leases and management agreements um i think this is a good vehicle to help the good clubs that sign up on the leases and management plans to assist them going forward and i know it was capped at 30 000 for the current budget but it 's something we need to look at going forward so we can give those good clubs out there a hand up as they sign up to new leases and agreements we now move on to item four economic activation and tourism item 4.1 page 44 small business friendly charter and ms clark will present this report good morning good morning good morning councillors um through to the chair taking the report and attachments is read i 'll provide an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business friendly charter initiative recognises local councils that are actively supporting small business in their regions and are focused on helping small business recover and build resilience following disasters and economic challenges it is important to highlight that the charter has received support from the region 's local chambers of commerce and industry groups and in particular the innisfail district chamber of commerce industry and tourism who have provided a loud voice for its members in support of the charter and the commitments that it entails the queensland small business commissioner 's office focused on the creation of a charter that aims to reduce barriers between large organizations and small business to enhance the operating environments for small businesses by committing to the new program in charter council will see a dual benefit it will reinforce our commitment to small business and their development as is identified in our corporate plan and the initiative will allow us to better connect with the needs of small business in the region the charter commitments will provide support to over 97 per cent of registered businesses in the kasseri coast region consultation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are impacted by the charter commitments and emt and externally through local chambers and industry groups i 'd also like to note that the report states that the mission beach chamber of commerce is awaiting incorporation however they have now announced their incorporation so congratulations to them this report holds a low risk profile with implications to policy through our procurement policy regarding payment terms and conditions with council to review current terms that sit at 30 days and financial and resource implications noting that majority of commitments and reporting requirements attach the charter will be absorbed by the business and industry liaison coordinator role the report recommends that council sign the charter at the queen 's queensland small business friendly conference on the 29th of april thank you ms clark any questions for the officer council macleod it 's not a question sorry through the chair um i just want to reiterate this is a really great initiative for small boys businesses in our region and i encourage all businesses to join their local chamber whether that be in cardwell tully mission beach or innisfail um because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great thank you council macleod any further comments or questions uh yeah i just wanna yeah okay move by council mill with second boy councillor mclaren before i put it to the vote i just want to talk about um the role that ms clark has now undertaken on behalf of council the business and industry liaison coordinator this came out of the effects of covert uh all of our local chambers went into hibernation business people were coming to the council looking for help guidance about funding grants etc uh and we had nowhere to steer them so it was essential that we created a coordinator within our core business our staff and hence we 've got this great report today where they 're starting to reform across castry coast i also like to talk about how this report connects to our corporate plan what do we want to see a strong diverse economy which provides opportunities for business and investment with an integrated approach to a long-term planning where the region 's assets meet the community 's needs and this report certainly delivers for all those small businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you uh we have a move in a second all in favor carry unanimously yeah yep i also want to back up what council and macleod said about encouraging people within the community especially businesses to get on board and join their local chamber because that really is your voice to to all avenues really within council so i really encourage you to get on board yeah well said thank you councillor milward um thank you thank you scott uh we now move on to item five governance environment and finance item 5.1 page 49 the finance report and mr jennings will present this report morning good morning morning mr jenny good morning yes so um the report is um for the end of february and it 's based on variance analysis and year-to-date actuals against budget so as as you 're aware it 's a requirement to present a financial report on a monthly basis to the council so i 'll go through the key highlights as at the end of february so overall surplus was 23.4 million and that 's 2.6 million favorable to the year-to-date budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 20.8 million now the reason for the 2.6 million favorable variants is operational revenue is um more than anticipated at the end of february so it 's just under 800 000 additional um income at that stage of the year and also operational expenditure is favorable by 1.7 million at the end of feb um cash balances for council were 65.7 million with about 22 million of that in short-term investments the capital expenditure for the month of february was 1.9 million with the year-to-date capital expenditure just under 21 million which is um 42 of the capital works program of 49 million so i 'll um briefly touch on the um what 's making up for you today variances the major ones are fees and charges are favorable by over 400 000 and that is largely due to an increase in building and planning fees based on greater demand than anticipated interest earnings is under budget by 145 000 and that 's obviously because of the um low interest rates that we 've had throughout the financial year but um it 's been communicated um that interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully you know um hopefully reaching budget by the end of june operating grants are favorable by 649 000 and that 's due to emergent works funding which relates to the previous financial year and it wasn 't included in the um adopted budget i 'll move on to employee expenses and they 're favorable to budget and that 's um largely due to several vacant positions so it 's actually 850 favorable in salaries and the majority of the vacant positions in um service delivery will um i know they 've been through a recruitment process so the majority of those positions will be filled and that is offset by an increase in contract labour costs so obviously with the vacant positions to get the work done we need to employ contractors so yeah if you have put employee costs and contract labor together notes off to zero or close to the other major variance is materials and services which is under budget by 1.7 million and that is due to reduced fleet expenditure and which is related to the timing of the waste plant delivery we 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bonus and the the main um favorable variance in materials and services is um the curb waste collection contract payments and their 650 favorable to budget but um obviously the contract payments are they 're not set to a specific amount each month so they will go up and down and we 've had a reduction in um electricity expenditure from the implementation of solar initiatives so um wrapping up there they 're the main issues when next month 's march finance report is tabled to council we 'll have a far better idea of where we expect to end up 30th of june um currently we 're saying that we 'll have a surplus of just under 12 000 but that 's likely to change when we do um you know forecasting and looking at the current budget so and i didn 't speak much about the capital program because that will be discussed later this morning so thank you thank you mr jennings any questions for the officer council millwood yes um through the chair so the contract labor cost which is actually higher at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce once once the recruitment process is completed do you think definitely yes and the other question is the waste contract payment that 657 is that because invoices haven 't been paid or um the last invoice paid was the november invoice but the finance team have been accruing the monthly invoices but it 's been based the accrual amount 's been based on the november invoice so yeah because i haven 't submitted their invoices we don 't actually know whether it 's higher or lower but it 's something that probably needs to be tabled that we um you know put some pressure on them to get their invoices in yeah thank you any further questions are moved by councillor bones seconded by councillor barnes all in favor carried unanimously thank you mr jennings i also note on page 51 council had 65 million in the bank in cash at an interest rate of 0.59 so potentially as interest rates go up that 's going to be a positive for us yeah it will be okay so yeah cash balances are good at the moment thank you mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been deferred to the april meeting that 's the provision of legal assistance for employees and councillors policy we now move on to item six asset sustainability 6.1 page 72 lease disposal in its file and district men 's shed and mr mcbride will present this report good morning good morning um this is for a lease disposal between council and the innisfail district mentioned incorporated uh as a summary council officers have been working with the executive committee of the innisfail and district menshed to grant two leases over their existing premises as described in this report as background the mentioned in innisfair in in australia a self-funded community organized organization providing support and activities for men and aiding in men 's health and companionship activities include furniture repairs and restoration woodworking projects minor mechanical repairs on small equipment which are often charged out for a small fee or sold for a small fee to fund the club 's activities the menshed have 35 active members who regularly participate in these activities dementia was established in 2013 and have occupied the site on corinda street which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site they have done a fantastic job of cleaning up the space continue to make improvements and grow and deliver to the services that it delivers today the current management agreement expires on the or expired on the 31st of january 2022 um and subsequently the um the innisfail men 's shed have [Music] applied for council to uh for a long-term lease at that site uh the menshed application was assessed against council 's adoptive principles and proposed community use of assets policy the this assesses organizations across four key criteria which includes governance uh governance and compliance criteria uh community and economic benefit sustainability and utilization the information provided by the means by the mentions shed demonstrated high value in each of these criteria reflecting their eligibility to enter into a long-term lease with council elise was negotiated with the menshed in line with the following key terms uh premises at karina street innisfail the term of 20 years rent would be a peppercorn arrangement at one dollar per year outgoings would be all eligible rates charges utilities and insurance and in regards to financial the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was noted in the risk that the existing facility contains asbestos and a number of old tires from the bmx track neither of these were installed by the innisfail men 's shed and the men shed requested that it not be held responsible to dispose of these assets or all these materials if such removal is necessary by changes in legislation or storm damage and council would agree to absorb these costs and council has agreed to do that as part of the lease in addition council have agreed to supply the menshed with consumables to manage noxious weeds over the old bmx site therefore it is recommended that council grant two leases to the innisfail and district menshed um incorporated over the existing lots at corinda street in where minnesota for a fixed term of 20 years rent one dollar per annum outgoings all rates and charges as described in the lease and permitted use would be menshed club and associated activities thank you mr mcbride um i initially like to acknowledge two people i attended the meeting in 2013 which was chaired by miss saffron who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community support centre management committee and a big group of men come together it was all about mental health and social well-being they needed social interaction when they retire they drive their wives mad and they needed a shed all men need a shed so to jackie thank you for what you did back in 2013 they initially found a home at the old scout hut on the corso that didn 't work out too good because scouting australia hit him with a big charge of six thousand dollars a year rent so uh miss saffron found the bmx track which had been abandoned it was untidy unsightly on the edge of wright 's park and they 've made it their home they 're very good corporate citizens do a great service in the community they help out a lot of other groups that need a bit of handiwork with timber in particular and uh i fully support the recommendation but uh councillor baines wants to say a few words um thank you mr mayor yes i do appreciate the ability to say a few words apparently i 'm getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men 's shed i 've got a significant zero at the end of one of my birthdays this year so i have had that discussion with the boys about when i can join up but what i wanted to speak to this morning was about this is a great example of the asset rationalization process that council 's going through and for people to understand that asset rationalization isn 't about destroying things and tearing things down i was complimented by some of the men 's shed members at the feast of the census on sunday about the excellent work the team had done a lot of small groups see these sort of processes as quite onerous and and think it 's something insurmountable but um i 'd like to speak to mr mcbride and mr valenti directly and they 've asked me to pass their congratulations on to the team that have worked with them in this process and again look i 'm very supportive my wife needs me to go somewhere so and i 'm sick of going to the dog house so i think that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be other people speaking but i would move the motion move boyce councilman seconded by councillor chewie second and uh councillor barnes first ah good thank you mr may just a question for mr mcbride when you go to that financial and resource implications could you just elaborate on that a little bit and is there a clause in the leases if any of these clubs fold should that be put in the lease what happens then or is that up to council decision at the time yeah i think that 's definitely highlighted as a risk and it 's like with any lease that uh or any form of tenure that council enters into with a community organization is that there is a risk that during that term uh the community group could fold and we acknowledge that if that 's the case those assets will come back to council for them to manage and potentially dispose of or or go out to lease again so it 's certainly been considered in this process yeah now that question i asked that financial and resource implications could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't got that paper it says through the application of appropriate clauses within the lease elise retains ownership of all improvements and will be responsible for all asset insurance so we say what the insurance value has got to be is that the way it works uh council gets all of its building assets valued periodically so we set that initial value and pass it on but it 's up to the men 's shed to manage that process into the future as they 're the uh the asset owners so we are going to ask them to pay like the word depreciation that doesn 't really come into a lease does it no but it 's in there the words there 's no depreciation because the community group is the owner of the asset so correct they do their own accounting it sits on their balance sheets and they manage insurance and thank you yeah so it council doesn 't appreciate the asset yeah thank you thank you councilman 's council chewie thank you mr just very quickly yes i just would uh think this is a great project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for community the most questions and queries that were asked were about where is a men 's shed a lot of new people had come to the area and seemingly they needed to find a bit of spare time for them by themselves so that was uh one thing that i noted was the men 's shed was the biggest most popular um venue destination thank you councilman just wanted to say through the chair that marshall will be very happy that you 'll have somewhere to go to get out of here no doubt about it it 's written on the side of the fridge already said uh any further questions or comments uh would somebody move the recommendation please oh sorry it 's been moved by councillor bones council chewie seconded all in favor carriage inanimacy thank you thank you mr mcbride move on to item 6.2 page 75 trade waste and water restrictions policy review mr page will present this report morning mr mayor mr ceo councillors okay so just in summary uh council is committed to ensuring its policies are reviewed and updated on a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updates have been implemented those two policies are the trade waste policy is05 and our water restrictions policy is w08 just a brief background on both of those policies the objective of council 's trade-based policy is to ensure the provision of a liquid waste disposal service for domestic commercial and industrial waste in accordance with the principles of environmental sustainability and with council 's legal responsibilities and obligations the policy also assists council to meet all legislative environmental requirements relating to the disposal of and reuse of effluent and sludge from its wastewater system and assist in the control of pollution from stormwater outposts under its control the objective of council 's water restrictions policy is to establish an approval process for the implementation of water restrictions for casserole coast regional council regularly reviewing policies and procedures keeps counsellors council staff and other stakeholders up to date with regulations technology and industry best practices policy review ensures that policies remain consistent current relevant and effective while also providing clarity to the leader when dealing with accountability issues or activities that are of critical importance to councils such as health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious consequences so the recommendation today is that council adopt the trade waste is w05 and water restrictions is wcr8 policies which have been reviewed with minor administrative changes made to their existing policies thank you mr page any questions for the officer if not moved by council chewie seconded by council millwood all in favor carriage inanimacy thank you thank you mr page thank you we now move on to item 6.3 page 83 the tids program transport infrastructure development scheme and mr fisher will present good morning morning yeah council councillors the tids program is it effectively known uh is the transport infrastructure development scheme funding program which is administered by the department of transport and main roads the funding is intended to support the development of the transport network within a region and our region being fnq rock the focus of that funding is largely around improving what 's known as local roads of regional significance which are the higher order roads that are as the name implies significant to the operation of the transport network across the region as a funding source the way this funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technical committee making a recommendation to the fnq rock regional road road group of which the mayor is a member this funding uh has proved very beneficial to council over the years with some significant projects built and constructed on a 50 50 basis like any funding program however there is a requirement that the funding is uh spent within the financial year that it is uh approved in and what this means is that uh there 's a requirement for all councils who participate in the scheme to be be organized and and deliver and what we find is uh across the region um as is the case in in in every region across the state um fnq rock is probably one of the better performing ones uh is that from time to time there 's a need to reallocate funding within that program to ensure that the program allocation is is spent in recent times i guess being organised and and having a good asset management plans and good works programs has has helped uh cassery coast regional council uh and uh with with a recent adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional road group uh council um picked up an additional 443 000 worth of funding for culvert renewal projects on kennedy creek road tully gorge road and bingle bay road so that 's a really good outcome um i guess the uh the ongoing work uh for culvert renewals is is is going to be a challenge for for our community um into the in the future so i guess the recommendation is to note that funding but also allocate the uh the the saving that uh comes from that 50 subsidy back into that renewal program for other culvert renewal projects and the council will continue to seek ted 's funding uh to support the delivery of transport projects that sit within our transport asset management plan so happy to take any questions thank you mr fisher any questions councillors councilmember yes through the chair so mr fisher when the reallocation of funds needs to be done does that is that taken back to fnq rock for the decision to be made yeah through the chair so the technical committee uh review um the program and based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fnq rock board so yes it does it does go back to that that board to make that decision any further questions i just like to complement our asset management team our asset management plans when the government rattled the cage about five years ago where councils were lagging they weren 't acquitting these funds in the appropriate time and hence a redistribution cashbury coast regional council was not on that list get it and spend it we were doing the right thing and you get rewarded when you do that because you get you 're the recipient of the reallocation of other people 's slow work in terms of implementing their projects so i just want to put that on record thank you for the great work you do on behalf of our council mr fisher are there any questions or comments cats mainstream thank you mr chair i 'm just going to reiterate what you said it is it is due to the great works that the council offices and the department make that we we often find ourselves in this great position where we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been done with the team within our organisation over well i 've only been here for a term and a half but it 's greatly improved and it 's it 's fantastic to see that these projects are coming forward and that cash request coast is recognized as you know we can get the money and we can get it done yep so it 's great to see so yeah i would again move this motion moved by council bone second to buy councillor pervin all in favor carried unanimously thank you we now move on to item 6.4 page 87 south mission beach shared path project mr fisher will present thanks mr chair councillors south mission beach uh pathway project uh to connect the the missing link between kennedy esplanade and the the uh current path that runs alongside the transfer station um has came out of a the mission beach cycle route strategy uh which was prepared in 2018 in consultation with the department of transport and main roads one of the main features of i guess that study was to identify the missing links throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve the connectivity and provide you know a network of pathways that would allow people to ride and walk around the beautiful mission beach we picked up some funding in 2019 uh four hundred thousand dollars on a 50 50 uh based project to construct a path between between those two areas around 460 metres in total uh by net by virtue of the um i guess one part which we 'll refer to as stage two in the report uh had some uh some significant challenges in terms of the available space and and the services in that verge to construct stage two so on that basis the project was was split into two stages and stage one about 280 meters of path was completed in december 2021 the stage two of the project uh still needs to be completed with 180 meters of pathway remaining to complete the connection uh initially the uh the intent as shown in the transport uh plan was to follow south mission beach road but as i said there 's some challenges there and so an alternative alignment which uh tracked behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessments and consultation with the state government the requirements there in terms of vegetation clearing to construct that path are quite difficult to achieve it would come at a significant cost in terms of studies and then a significant amount of vegetation would have to be be cleared so on that basis the project team we consider that the best approach to complete this project is to proceed with the original alignment along south mission beach road this will facilit require some property acquisitions to provide us enough room to fit the pathway in if people are familiar with that site it is quite tight when you go down there however um you know we do know that in the past uh and there 's a bike bus that runs from south mission to the um mission beach school and you know there is you know it 's a pretty important missing link it 's one of the steepest narrower sections remaining on that connection so uh recommendation is that council can proceed with the detailed design of stage two with the alignment adjacent to south mission beach road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detailed design and continue to engage with dtmr regarding approvals and funding thank you mr fisher any questions for your council milward yes through the chair so mr fisher i 've got two questions first one was uh when was the community consultation done for this and the second question is was there any consideration for this path to go along the existing track down near the surf club yes through the chair um i understand that in 2018 there was some broad uh consultation undertaken uh regarding the cycle route strategy report uh that was obviously a very high level uh report which looked at pathways from bingle bay all the way through to south mission beach further to that in in recent times when we 've when this project has come out as a project in its own right there 's been engagement with adjoining property owners in in terms of consultation and then i guess general conversations with the coordinator of the mission beach bike bus who recognizes the importance of this this link in the network regards to the the alternative alignment through that existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report and the tmr funding we received is to deliver high class cycling infrastructure and there 's very specific standards from tmr around that the main one being two and a half metres is the minimum width uh and and the department are really looking for alignments that are i guess facilitate um uh you know high volume uh high speed type uh you know in terms of cyclists go uh access and on and also another key consideration of that program is to to think about i guess natural surveillance so you 'll see that a lot of the routes that uh that we 've been using for this funding seaview street marks park and the like while there are alternatives available um you know i guess the usage and the safety element there for particularly young young children is that it you know picking alignments that uh don 't take people off off the road where there 's high levels of natural surveillance from passing vehicles is another key consideration so uh that specific route was not considered largely on the bus of i guess the intent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that main roads provide to these types of projects thank you mr fisher any further questions if not but somebody moved the recommendation please moved by councillor mccloud seconded by councillor chewie all in favor carried unanimously thank you we now move on to item 6.5 page 93 ccr capital report mr fisher will present thank you mr chair councillors regular monthly update on the capital report um as at the 6th of march we were approximately 62 spent on our um capital program um thankfully the sun has shown its face and the the weather has improved that 's labeled our crews and our uh contractors to make some uh much needed progress given the wet weather earlier in the year i guess some recently completed projects um cardboard transit center asphalt overlay um smart meters in belvedere and wallet smith park toilet renewal as well as wells road re-sheeting uh i 'm just uh yeah happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability how that councils might have about specific projects in there any questions or comments counsellors i just like to comment on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note the caretaker for this period has moved in and i noted last week a lot of ground work being done by contractors in terms of a internal road system which is great because last year they were being pulled out of there because they got bogged it is the old town dump so i understand why you would get bogged there they 've now learned their lesson and uh they 're spending some money on that great asset so with the tourist season ready to start they 've moved in ready to go and i note their members were there doing the mowing as well so it 's a great outcome for council we no longer service that park it 's all done by cmca so it was a great result and in return cmca commented that that park was the most successful park they 've ever opened in australia in the first three months of operation uh they were overwhelmed by uh what they saw uh when they come to do the official opening so well done justin to you and your team uh any questions uh council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a comment about the implementation of the crew boy function so i 'm hoping that we should start to see some benefits reaping from the changes that we 've made in that space through the chair i think as in the work being done yeah absolutely i think um you know as all the counselors are well aware that one of the main thrusts of that was to really get some those teams set up by function so that those they could really prioritize their time and their effort into one you know or less core disciplines rather than being spread across a whole variety and yes it 's it 's um i guess even as a capital works team those i guess the conversations around programming and scheduling and the works that you know we might put out to tender are certainly becoming uh i guess far more effective that we know we 've got that dedicated resource to the capital program so yes to share your hope that we we start to see improvement there thank you for that comment council millwood council chewie sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's this far away or just the plantings were going in is that correct through the chair yes yeah yeah that far away uh yes the the planning 's uh one of the main outstanding things to be completed as well as the um the painting of the islands just to improve that look uh we 're also uh i guess one of the things which we intend to do uh probably on on the back of the um the larger cbd project is obviously install some solar lighting in that car park as well but effectively the the landscaping is the the main outstanding thing to open that park up i did and i have spoken to you but if you could just uh clarify for us all there is a a design of car parks we can 't just have like matchbox cars lined up in a row is that correct there has to be flow and safety factors have to be taken into consider when design is created yeah through the chair that 's that 's right um we um i guess yeah when when designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big open area and then we went and put a whole heap of islands and and what not in there which um i i guess could say we 're taking away from the space but um as we 'll all know from our own experience in you know understanding a variety of uh and driving through a number of car parks and particularly with the increasing amount of large 200 sized land cruiser 200 size vehicles around making sure that the car parks have enough space for people to drive drive through and circulate uh find parks not get into dead ends where they where they can 't then get out of uh that that means that you have to provide those islands and that line marking to provide that that flow um because yeah if you don 't you can end up with a whole heap more car parks but no one actually wants to go into the car park because um you know it might stress their marriage or something else like that so council bourbon good morning mr fisher just two questions the innersville aerodrome was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upcoming innocent auto fest yes through the chair yes there is and we have um just got quotes on that that um that work now so the there was originally some funding in the budget to do a what 's called a run-up area for the users there so effectively rather than having a bitumen sealed area where they can rev their engines prior to takeoff just to test that everything 's working as as normal obviously with a bitumen seal there can be loose stones and that can flick up and cause some unwanted damage to their propellers so the intent of that project was to install an asphalt pad with less chance of debris following on from that with the conversation around auto fest there was a requirement to increase the size of that area to accommodate what would be a burnout pad for that event that has increased obviously the the budget for that that project and uh it 'd be one of the while we 've got quotes on that now it 's one of the key things we 'll be talking with councillors about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive of of that increase based on the fact of you know that it won 't actually bring benefits to the users it 's more about facilitating the auto fest event so yeah david mr goodman i just want to say mr fisher slightly misspoke there and i 'm sure councillors be well aware that increase in scope doesn 't increase the budget it has increased the price of the work so the budget hasn 't changed thanks for the correction and we need to manage we need to manage that process thank you for that clarification mr goodman and one more mr fischer um can you give us an update on the transfer station at mission beach at all how 's it going and we still got issues down there with the overspend through the chair i 'll have to take that one or notice i haven 't heard anything that would that suggests to me that there 's anything to add in terms of additional escape from my last update but i 'll take that one on notice and get back to you thank you cancer norwood um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murray street upgrade um i see it 's in design phase 90 is there any line of sight as to when we might see this project on the table sure through the chair uh that project we 've given our final comments back to the designers so uh expected uh full um final design within the next week uh the um i guess one of the key considerations now is whether we look to deliver that work in-house or contract it out we will work through with our delivery services team and then in the next coming weeks to work out whether we once that design is complete whether we advertise a tender or whether we choose to deliver that in-house either way expect the work to start in june and commence then so whether it 's an in-house or external delivery we 're on track for that just a comment around um crew by function the feedback i 'm getting from the workforce is that our people are very happy with the process for council to get increased productivity we need flexibility and crew by function will deliver that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to port henry and look after normalization of those assets including the series treatment plan on the other end of the scale we 've got laborers who have been asking for opportunities to become multi-skilled in the water section and we 've got five labourers that are now doing restricted plumbing licenses so good outcomes right across the board and the feedback from the blue collar sector is one of uh of happiness that they 've been listening to getting their their opportunities uh in the crew by function area some of our key people have now been elevated as team leaders in those crews so um yeah everything i 'm hearing about those structural changes has been really positive uh are there any further comments or questions yes sorry councilman um this um duncan jetty is that the replenishment that 's in here in no so that 's not the sand replenishment that is i guess an allocation to repair corrosion on that structure no further questions or comments somebody moved the recommendation please move by councillor bones seconded by council pervin all in favor let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to item 7 planning services 7.1 page 107 activate cashery coast development incentive scheme and mr jones will present this report welcome again good morning everyone good morning uh council this policy has been affected various iterations since 2014 the purpose of this report is to adopt an amended policy until the 31st of march 2023 correct minor administrative errors remove ambiguity in regards to eligibility of land within the residential and rural residential zone where the land is when the land is not serviced by the trump sewerage supply infrastructure network and clearly state council 's intentions regarding the eligibility of land within the rural zone and township 's own kabul local plan cardboard port henshin brook precinct given the issues surrounding the ownership of the critical infrastructure the aim of this policy is an encouraged development that achieves certain strategic objectives for the castro coast by allowing a reduction in infrastructure charges payable of up to 100 in relation to certain eligible developments in eligible locations it is recommended that the amended policy be adopted and have effect until the 31st of march 2023 it is noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount on infrastructure charges is granted for a particular development and to what percentage and the chief executive officer undertake a review of the policy and investigate the workshop and provide a report to council prior to the 31st of march 2023 with consideration of current market trends the local government infrastructure plan and infrastructure charges haven 't answered any questions council thank you mr jones i just want make a comment about the policy initially the planning department brought a proposal to mayor shannon and we were finding at the time that a lot of da 's were being approved but they were lapsing there was a hell of a lot of land banking occurring and uh councillors of the day thought it was a good idea to give this a go uh when councillor cromastis was a elected mayor the plan has come to the mayor and said look the policy is working well we think it can be more effectively increasing to 100 for the small minority that don 't accept this policy they need to realize we had a bad record of land banking we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation uh you know and now this policy has made it happen so i 'm very supportive of it going forward but anyway look i 'd like to uh ask of any uh council of art sorry thank you mr mayor um i also am totally in favor of this as i think it will stimulate building in our area and just remember it is only for 12 months if anyone has any issues with it thank you thank you for that councilman our councillor perfect yes thank you mr chair yeah look it 's as you 've just said council of odds it 's only for an extra 12 months but i mean it 's been taken up relatively good in our last 18 months of council now um for me i think it 's a great move and we are only doing areas that are that have infrastructure in place it 's not like we 're going to go to a rural area and say go for your life bill 14 units here you 're not paying a cent it 's only within those areas that council dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred percent that we will give every developer it 's on it 's on a base it 's on a you know a basis where there could be some developments only 50 and the recommendation will come from officers to council to consider that as well so it 's not always going to be 100 thanks for that clarification council bourbon council bones thank you mr chair for your indulgence um i i think we 're also missing some of the external financial benefit that 's flowing out of this i had a conversation last week with a couple of our um local retailers that work with white goods and housing goods and and the the increase in the builds that this sort of incentive is encouraging is really benefiting their businesses quite significantly they 've seen a lot of work going on we 've got new people moving in they don 't want to drag everything up with them out of sydney or melbourne and they 're fitting out brand new houses locally in our local businesses so the extra benefit that flows out of the policy like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well so it 's great work and i fully support this policy thank you for those positive comments council mains uh council milward yes i 'd just like to reiterate one important thing within that policy and it 's eligible projects in eligible locations so yeah that 's really important yeah and and thank you for that point uh and that 's why the word uh uh the jurisdiction of the council to make a decision about that we 're not locked into a tight framework we have the flexibility to make that interpret interpretation i know this policy is working because people from other regions have contacted me personally and asked for a rundown of how it works and and i 'll put them in touch with our staff so i know there 's other regions watching this policy closely as well are there any further comments or questions somebody moved the recommendation moved by council seconded by council millwood all in favor carriage unanimously thank you item 7.2 page 116 application for reduction infrastructure charges uh mr

charges uh mr mayor i 'll be leaving the room as i said earlier this is the one okay thank you councillor barnes no b1 i should have said b1 thank you thank you mr mayor uh councillors and receipt of requests from mr murray quagliata care of planning plus for 100 reduction infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create two rural lots the antennas at the larger lot being proposed lot one will continue to be farmed for sugarcane and it 's a smaller lot being proposed lot too will allow for the construction of a new dwelling house and associated outbuildings there was sufficient justification for council to approve the reconfiguration given that the site was split by a defined watercourse and a good quality agricultural land assessment report for proposed lot 2 concluded that it was unsuitable for agricultural production with its own right proposed development does not comply with eligibility criteria number 3 of the reduction in structure charges policy given that the two rule lots be continued to be zoned rule under the planning scheme and given the rule zoning of the lot the development does not provide for capital investment in accordance with the planning scheme therefore is recommended the council refused a reduction in infrastructure charges requests given that the proposed development does not comply with the eligibility criteria or intent of the policy happen to answer any questions council thank you mr jones any questions moved by councillor mccloud second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody thanks dan can i just say in closing off that last matter a true measurement of how good this policy is uh those two added to the eight that we approved last meeting so in the last two two months ten one was it one today oh yeah we not going back sorry yep uh okay we move on to item 7.4 page 128 the mission beach tourism area monetary contributions in lieu of provision of car parking mr jones will present thank you mr mayor the purpose of this report is for council to consider implementing a new policy being the mission beach tourism area monetary contributions in lieu of the provision of car parking policy the mission beach master plan recognises the need for reconfigured car parking and separation between vehicles and pedestrians in the mission beach tourism area council council purchased land at the corner of endeavour avenue in campbell street and has constructed 56 car parks on the site whilst development in mission beach would ordinarily be required to provide a combination of on-site and on-street car parking the purpose of this policy may allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developer towards the cost of the provision of car parking in lieu of physical provision of car parks either on-site or on-street by the developer there 's noted that the payment of a monetary contribution under the infrastructure agreement in lieu of the provision of on-site car parking does not provide an applicant with ownership rise the car park shall remain under council control and must be available for use by the general public at all times if council decides to accept a monetary contribution in lieu of providing car parking spaces the applicant shall pay a monetary contribution in accordance with the following formula the shortfall in the number of car park spaces required under the planning scheme multiplied by twenty one thousand nine hundred and twenty seven dollars the calculation of this figure is explained in the body of the report but includes both the cost and the cost of the land and construction costs of the car park the policy would apply to land located within the township zone greater mission beach tourism precinct council has recommended that council adopted mission beach and dropped the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the 30th of june 2022 and in lieu of the provision of providing on-site car parking the applicant shall pay a monetary contribution of twenty one thousand nine hundred and twenty seven dollars per car park and request the chief executive officer investigate workshop and provide a report to council provided the june 2022 regarding the monetary contribution in lieu of the provision of car parking which incorporates all relevant townships within the region including the review of this policy happy to answer any questions council thank you mr jones uh councillor pervin you 've got the planning chair you might expect yeah mr mayor i 'd like to move a motion uh that council adopt the mission bench to number one adopt the mission beach tourism monetary contributions in lieu of the provision of a car parking policy subject to the monetary contribution in lieu of the provision of car parking reflect reflecting the construction costs only of a figure of twelve thousand four hundred and twenty nine dollars excluding gst per carpark and number two request the chief executive officer investigate workshop and provide a report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieu of the provision of car parking policy which considers mission beach cardinal innisfail and tully the reasons for not adopting the recommendation of officers set is that in most most capace cases council can provide additional car parks in existing road areas and reserves and in those circumstances it 's not reasonable to include the purchase price of land and the calculation of a monetary contribution i 'll put that forward to my fellow councillors do we have a second of that council of arms you second uh yes mr may i also would like to talk on it thanks for inviting me to do so i just don 't think like in the future we are as a council we 'll be building further car parks and we don 't know where orland 's going to come from we would probably we probably will be using council land and we don 't know that we are going to be buying land in the future so i think it 's just an absorbent cost and i 'd like to support the mover thank you councillor and council milward um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a car park on council land and we are required to buy the land to build the car park um is the monetary contribution in line with other areas mr jones would you yeah mr graf yeah yeah through the chair uh thanks to christian council millard um it really does come down to a case-by-case basis so uh obviously the price of land will be different between kabul mission beach tully and inside and therefore i 'm expecting that once we do do this review if it 's passed by council today that those figures will differ between them between the four happy with that response councilman yep okay we have a move in a second any further comments put it to the vote all in favor that 's uh councillor barnes chewie mccloud baines pervin and nolan and katz milward against okay that now becomes the substantive motion all in favor again councillor barnes dewey mcleod baines urban and nolan that 's carried thank you we move on to general business any general business counselors counselor chewie thank you mr mayor uh i just have some questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr goodman mr mr fisher mr mcbride mr slattery anybody well it 's all their sort of stuff mr goodman 's the head honcho so i figured he would know it all i 'm hoping so mr goodman no pressure i certainly don 't know everything i just have three uh questions um the nature play at wheatley park i know it 's uh on the no i missed it oh there you go wrong director i stand corrected apologies but don 't go away don 't apologize counselor we 've apologies mr um sadler for not calling you up yes so we could just have an update on where we are with the nature play i know community are very keen to see this move forward so if you could fill us in that would be great thank you yeah sure through the chair councillor um as you know uh wheatley 's park was um utilised for the irreverent uh film um which obviously gave a huge economic boost to our region during covert and the want from that is to obviously give wheelie park a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space improvement plan nature play has been identified as as where we would like to unlock there is some draft designs that have been uh done recently and the team has been talking with c4 and um peter rules and a few others down there we have looked at that project and we will do some broader consultation moving forward so that will be in the near future and i 've asked the asset maintenance team to work with the community relations and services team to do so thank you do we have a time frame at all in regarding to when we might actually see when i can go and play in the park i 'll have to take that on notice council i don 't have that timeline at this stage thank you sorry through the chair the comms will be out uh this week is the intent to actually go out and and seek some feedback from the community on the current design but the up the outcome i guess of that community consultation will drive delivery for the project we don 't want to put something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you i do have a couple more is this for you no use mr sadler not at all thank you mr saddle if you don 't mind um we 've spoken previously about the state of the kirima range and the future works would you have a report there in relation to kumar range through the chair deputy mayor i talked with the works planner earlier in the week in relation to one of the things you had queried previously was around vegetation and tree tree management on that on that road um they are they were programmed and with the rain that we did have um a few couple of weeks ago there 's been a whole lot of reactive works requests that have been done so they 're working on that they at this stage have planned for the next fortnight obviously whether dependent to go up there and do those works but we want to do that prep work in relation to we do have future work um roadworks coming up up there so i 'm going to do that before the machinery gets rolled out good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this may be a state matter may not be a council matter but i do have a caravan park owner had a hell of an issue last week now the week before last where he had a covered possible a positive person staying in his band park who would not isolate kept going to the toilets shop so he evicted this person and has been put through turmoil by this person not only one-on-one but also on social media um i 'm probably asking you too hard a question as a counselling officer but just your thoughts yeah through the chair um deputy mayor that 's it is a state ruling i suppose the chief health officer has directives in relation to that and when you do have a positive test there 's a process in relation to registering with queensland health those things they do have fact sheets and in relation to how you isolate and i suppose not knowing all the detail of this one particularly there 's a covert hotline that you can ring which is i 've just got the number here 13 4268 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operator might need but also the um the guest uh in in relation to and also highlighting the range of different alternatives that person or the guest could accommodate and that might not be at that location so without knowing all the bits and pieces that that 's where i would go and direct particularly the the operator and i suppose with shared facilities and things that you 've just highlighted that that is definitely a risk for transmission so um i think that was probably a good choice on that on that behalf thank you um i won 't use a name i will just throw it out there the update please on the bengal bay path i 've had community members talk to me about the design plan being on the website and for so people can look at it do you have any information on that mr goodman um i 'm fairly certain that it is not on the website but it is something that uh we just had some discussion about that this morning that something can be can be added yeah but my understanding was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walkthrough could look at it and make their uh the people that live in the community could have some input into the proposal so make sure that happens thank you um sorry and just uh the update on the missing toilets at ulysses park are we any closer for market stall holders to have a toilet facility at wheatley 's on market day thank you yes uh simple answer to that is through the chair is uh is yes uh so the uh one i have um uh we believe um largely uh completed installation of that toilet that would they will make available to um to stall holders at the markets and we 're expecting commissioning of that within a week so confirming it 's for the stall holders so who actually owns the toilet the the caravan park people management yes correct uh if there are issues i 'm not saying there will be but if there are issues do council have a right to to query uh any reluctance on the behalf of the park to to actually share the facility we have an agreement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holders so if that 's not the case then we were happy to to be part of those discussions to um ensure that agreement is is honored um further that there are i guess in terms of the general public we are advancing it 's sort of been an off again on again uh access to the um progress hall um and we are have an in-principle agreement with the mission beach and bengal bay progress association we have a draft of a user agreement that would that we could we would like to enter into with that entity and and that would allow public access on um on market days to those toilets that would be fantastic i know we 've had several hiccups along the way with that so i would love to see that happen so i thank you for the work that 's been done thank you thank you council chewie council mill would you had your hand up next yeah through the chair i 'd just yeah like to reiterate what trudy said that it was actually the toilet that will be supplied with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public toilet um and the other thing was um i just wanted to thank all the people who participated in the recent clean up australia day i know that down at caromine beach we collected 330 kilos of rubbish so well done to everyone that participated in any area thanks thank you councilman any further uh councillor pervin yeah mr mayor um i 'd just like to say a big congratulations to the organization of the feast of the

the support of the work camp guys which is huge and you know that council permanent because you 've done the hard stuff in terms of supplying your own vehicle collecting the marquis and returning them uh i want to acknowledge mr sadler uh who didn 't honour his commitment and gotta get up at four uh he he um he celebrated heavily about that trophy on saturday night and and councillor pervin had to ring him and kick him in the ribs about 4 30. but to his credit he did front up and he put in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh the crowd was brilliant at the gala dinner we had people from townsville in brisbane sitting beside us and they were the ones that made the complaint about we tried to book river cruises booked out tried to do the food trail booked out and they visited our region for the whole weekend and there was nothing on the saturday so clearly at the swat meeting uh the committee of seven have got to do a review and fill that gap on the sad day we 're gonna keep people here attract them and keep them for the whole weekend we 've got to give them something to do on the saturday but outstanding work by seven volunteers previously it 's been organized by a coordinator who got thirty thousand a year so nobody got paid and yet seven volunteers stepped up and delivered a great outcome like that um it was very well run and very well delivered on the day spoke to people who are still holders and they said couldn 't couldn 't fault the way it was managed and delivered uh there weren 't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they smashed records in terms of takings and in cane cutter court the kids arcade was open and i went past there a few times it was packed out so a couple of real big additions this year and that was the thrust of moving from the centre of town to the riverfront activities for our children and uh parents supported us in in spades uh because uh that the people that volunteered at kids corner could not believe the amount of money they take in there so uh councillor perman you were the leader from a council point of view thank you very much for what you did and how you delivered uh much appreciated council chewie yes i 'd just like to support our council pervert in your own words mr mayor i think it was a great event i 'd like to congratulate the students of good council college who also gave up their sunday to help it 's great to see the young people getting out and volunteering and being part of the community events uh councillor pervin do we need more members on that committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardened you know to come by so do we ask now if people love the event so much are they willing to actually be part of the organizing of it members roy members are always wanted for the committee for the yeah for the feast of the census group and i 'm sure when the meetings kick off not too far away to have a end of um event and then early next year though i 'm sorry it won 't be far away that would next year 's event so yeah members are more than welcome to join and just go to the feast of the census website for that information council um thank you mr mayor and far be it for me not to say something in general business on the feast of the senses i hear the cooking demonstrations were extraordinarily impressive especially the first one this year i heard it was really really quite good um now the the what i wanted to raise today mr mayor was to bring to everyone 's attention because we won 't have another meeting beforehand anzac day is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing some great work with all the rsls in the area and a lot of the pre-planning has already been done so i would just encourage everyone to please keep in their minds anzac day monday the 25th the dawn services kick off at 4 20 which was the exact time apparently the first boot hit the ground um so make sure you 're there well before then and uh i look our community is always very supportive of of anzac day ceremonies and i 'd just like to pass my congratulations on to our officers who have a self who have assisted uh the clubs in their work so anzac day don 't forget to see you there thanks council bynes any further general business council bonds oh good thank you mr mayweather we 've got mr goodman up there we don 't want to make his day too easy mr goodman um the teething problems at the tully grandstand there 's a few issues there it 's a beautiful structure but like any building there 's teething problems we do have something to report um through the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing there um some of those um are taking a little longer to deal with because some of those items are still in the warranty and so we 're making sure that those are repaired under warranty rather than just going replacing or fixing them ourselves so that can take a little longer to to make sure that that 's done and and not costing counsel in in managing those so there has been issues with the lift recent issues with the lift that 's been repaired and is fully operational um there were some issues with the security doors access to the kitchen those that is repaired and operational there 's opportunity for some future improvements in in those doors to make sure that that doesn 't uh that that failure in locking doesn 't happen again and we 're working through considering those there 's [Music] inspection by the warranty inspection on some of the fridges one of the fridges in the kitchen today dishwasher again is a warranty repair and we don 't have a date as yet from the warranty from the supplier in cans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh the we are waiting uh on a motor to be replaced there and uh i guess it 's no no surprise to anybody that supply of different parts and materials are a bit of a struggle these days right across the board so teams working to [Music] to get those issues repaired um uh also taking into account that we where they are a warranty items that we are getting those done um by the supplier or manufacturer rather than rate payers paying for that we have also now got weekly cleaning in in much of that facility on a weekly basis um that 's been done uh externally and not by the users um and so we 're building that into the management of that facility and as a meeting with the significant users of that facility organized in the first week of may as we look to progress a user agreement a formal user agreement that facility thank you very much for a very intense report i was waiting for mr fisher to give a report on the mountain bike meeting that he attended earlier on tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all our council staff that attended the 5 30 meeting at the cardwell country club last tuesday that was very well attended by the public and also we had three speakers from world trails and a very intense works program and design structure it was very well done on the building of the pump track which will be they had videos except so people who know knew nothing about it left very very well informed um have you got any more to add to that um through the chair i can add um mr fisher uh and our um uh project manager they were both giving me an update on that meeting and both were very uh positive about the large turnout and and um the positive reception from the community of cardwell it 's also pointed out that there was commitments for donations of helmets and a bike from western australia and uh our the the project manager that we have appointed for that project is going to take it upon herself to challenge some north queensland um bike shops to lift their game into uh providing um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books so i 've just taken it upon herself we 're not paying her as a project manager to do that but she 's gonna challenge some north queensland particularly some cairns bike shops to um to to get on board with that and uh and getting the community of cardwell um encouraging to use this new facility good thank you very much and probably a question to yourself or the ceo whoever chooses to answer it i see you 're both biting at the bit the sewage and dredging update uh look through the chair as you can understand uh the commonwealth they 're often um very interested in announcing uh funding agreements and um funding so we 're we 're sitting waiting for that process as far as the the commonwealth funding for the stp itself um so that funding has been committed and executed on our behalf we 're waiting for a formal announcement to be made in that space the state funding agreement is at the last phase of negotiations and uh council officers are considering uh that agreement currently that 's uh in its fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement so that um the commitment again has been received from the commonwealth i think a fourth iteration of that agreement has gone back to the federal government um yesterday i believe so everything is moving um concurrent to those processes council is uh out currently for tender for the detailed design of the stp uh council has been meeting with the liquidator around access to dredge spoiled ponds on on 170 and progressing those conversations uh and have a project manager on this project who is uh is driving some outcomes i think we 're also currently up the survey uh for the site so uh those process is working concurrently and everything is is moving at this stage in line with the the project 's uh plan thank you uh further to that the electorate of interbrook nick de meadow staff contacted andrew this week seeking a summary of what he just spoke to and it will appear in nick 's bulletin on the 4th of april so the wider community is going to be fully informed through the hintonbrook electorate office are there any further general business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tui initiative initially she asked councillors to wear blue and yellow in support of the people of ukraine who are being slaughtered currently and today pastor mark jewett delivered a very lovely opening prayer where he touched on the plight of the people in ukraine so to take it a little bit further i 've got a proposal for councillors consideration that we follow the lead great lead of southern councils where they 're flying the ukrainian flag at their council chamber i think it 'd be a good look those people have lost their freedom uh as i said many lives have been lost lost at the moment and it wouldn 't cost us a lot to show our support via flight flying the ukrainian flag at the tully and uniform chamber if there 's an appetite i won 't move a motion i 'll leave it simply with the ceo find some petty cash there 's got to be a hollow log there somewhere and see if we can do that for the people of ukraine can i leave that with you mr ceo i now want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been contested 21 times the leprechauns have now won 13 the roosters three are eight they 've won it the last three years uh when i sought permission to bring it down here today because i know there 's atherton councils watching there 's a double message here um when i got the leprechaun gesture to pick this up they actually just bought loctite from bunnings so that 's going to be staying in the category codes for a long time but they did lend it to us for today it was a great game uh they flogged us at under 18. uh terrific game in reserve grade a last minute try in the last minutes of the game and then a conversion from the sideline in the last seconds of the game and that game ended up 20 all but the a great game was really tight gritty 8-4 at half-time the laps got on top in the second half and rod marty uh very politely handed over the trophy and it now belongs in in our hands for another year uh the only year that it didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh they 've held it 2018 19 and 2021. 2020 the game didn 't go ahead because of covet so a bit of history had been recorded on that as well about the pandemic so i just wanted uh to acknowledge to fellow councillors uh the trophy has returned and uh leprechauns are getting locked tied to keep it here for a long time given there 's no further general business we 'll now close the meeting to the public and the reasons for closing the meeting to the public we

unanimously thank you thank you miss vic uh we move on to item 9.2 page 142 family day care scheme and miss saffron will present this report welcome thank you the recommendation is that council adopts a new fee structure to commence on the 4th of april 2022 the proposed fee structure will be educators working under under 30 hours per week be charged 1.95 administration educators working 30 to 50 hours per week will be charged 1.8 administration fee and educators working over 50 hours per week will be charged 1.65 the request that the ceo investigate federal government sustainability funding program eligibility thank you for suffering any questions for the officer counselor chewie thank you mr may um just uh just quickly in relation to daycare in general um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won 't be impacted by families in any way no the families it doesn 't affect the families at all okay excellent and just in day care in general um we 're still looking for carers throughout the entire castle yeah looking for carers at this time we 've got 10 carers and basically we 've had up to 32 carers um it doesn 't matter how many carers we 've got we don 't be able to manage the need for childcare excellent and what can can carers select the amount of hours is there a minimum amount that they can provide ideally ideally um no less than three days a week and that 's basically um based on the fact that there 's a lot of administration and work involved for the educator as well as for the service but um as far as the educator is concerned it 's probably not worth the effort if it 's less than that and what uh what criteria do you need they need to have a a certificate in childcare either have one or be working towards a blue card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's listening there 's work out there if you want it thank you thank you council cherry any further questions just one quick question mr may uh mr saffron has there ever been a private company approached you on purchasing a business as such this means no no um on because these are contracts so you 've got to be registered with the federal government you 've got to go through an accreditation process to undertake to be able to provide the service and the educators are contractors so i 'm not sure how that would work in the sense of purchasing the the business um but no no one 's ever approached us i just yeah sorry i think yes as mr mayor mentioned the family day care system is vital to our community my children loved it um when they were there and i know i 've been approached by people for after-school care school holiday care it 's a really really important part uh for working parents you know so i you know congratulate our team and do hope that we get more people are willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day carer thank you thank you councillor too you 're dead right in terms of our social fabric uh having a service like family day care is critical particularly at the moment if you look at the federal election they 're all talking about cost of living well if you 're going to address cost of living in your household budget mum 's got to be able to go to work one wage doesn 't cut it and if we don 't have family day care mom can 't go to work simple as that and we 've got a responsibility to play our part in that i believe uh would somebody move the recommendation please uh councillor baines seconded by councillor tui all in favor carried inanimously thank you uh we net thanks ms safran we now move on to 9.3 page 153 the hyatt street reservoir supply main stage one mr page will present okay the purpose of this report is for council to consider submitted attendance and award contract ccw 000176 for the hyatt street reservoir supply main stage 1. the works associated with this contract entail

and all matters associated with or in relation to the contract subject to council 's normal procurement policies and practices thank you mr page any questions or comments council millwood moved by council melbourne second by councillor permanent question uh before we put the vote i just want to say um water is critical in terms of our services to the community i shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and he was envious of the fact that we don 't have boiled water alerts anymore it 's because of the recommendations our staff have made cost billions of dollars and a lot of it 's been funded by state and federal we 've been fortunate but we also have a lot of breaks under the ground uh council perving belvedere council milward and tully i think that 's the highest rate is in tully so we 've got to support these recommendations because if we can 't deliver good drinkable water uh it 's third world stuff simple as that it 's it 's a good investment i would cancel our plans uh mr page well we 've got you i know you would have covered these bases but just to make sure we 're right with access roads we 're right with permits and the land it sits on yes uh we 've entered into we 've purchased all the land we 've gone through all those agreements and so forth previous to getting to this point in time so yes we 've covered all those bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a second all in favor carry

state government departments and mr nick demetto the member for hinchenbrook and through you mr chairman when you make your announcement i believe that anyone who has had a notion that council has not worked diligently robustly and energetically towards a solution for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port hinchenbrook i believe that anybody who has had that notion will be uh disabused of that thought um immediately upon hearing your words um and uh and i look forward equally to hearing your words it was quite a an extraordinary outcome from a very serious meeting it was a meeting which was conducted without prejudice and in principle and it 's important for me to mention that the meeting was predicated on information expressed through the state government from the federal government uh which has not yet been reduced to writing so the the the transparency in respect of this is is absolute we 're dealing with something um which has uh so much uh urgency attached to it that uh we 're not going through the usual procedures whereby we 'd be exchanging letters and uh having our uh legal representatives uh dealing with uh negotiations it 's been directly done as of yesterday and i look forward to hearing your words this afternoon mr mean uh yeah thanks mr ceo and i just want to um clarify that the statement that i 'll read out has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the room as well the outcome the bureaucrats were seeking was an in-principle agreement after we heard what they had to present we struck that agreement and there 's a an aggressive plan going forward from today to deliver an outcome within 30 days so it 's really exciting news we can 't talk about the detail and as i said again what i read out was not prepared by me or the ceo it was prepared by the two uh state department and queensland treasury who called the meeting in cairns yesterday okay we go back to the agenda and confirmation of the minutes uh 1.1 page two uh the minutes of the meeting on the 24th of june 2021 with somebody move that they are a true and accurate record moved by councillor bones seconded by councillor barnes all in favor it 's carried unanimously thank you 1.2 page 31 the special budget meeting 2021 2022 somebody moved out through an accurate record moved by council milwaukee second by councillor tui on favor carried unanimously uh 1.3 page 44 special local government meeting dated the 25th

three sets of minutes council chewie yeah thank you good good morning through the chair um i just in relation to um some of the conferences that we were given um leave for i believe some a couple of those have been uh postponed due to covert if anybody would like to comment on that i think councillor baines and councillor millwood were to be in attendance so i just thought i 'd ask thank you yeah so through the chair the um australian women in local government meeting that i had been okay to go to at early beach has now been postponed till sometime in 2022 due to covert thank you all right mr c councillor baines thank you for your indulgence mr chairman so further to that the council leaders conference that was ready to happen in august has also been postponed so it hasn 't been put off and as soon as the date is set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will there 'll be another date sent out and i would like to express my intention to still attend on your behalf mr may thank you council bones councillor barnes good thank you very much mr may um section in 2.1 the sale of blocks of land in tully i 'd just like to let everyone know that there 's been a frenzy in the purchase of those and it 's great to see people wishing to spend so much money in our region it 's a great look moving on then to 8.1 um no not 8.1 8.12 well it 's the crocodiles mr me i 'm just going to get back to there um we 've had a dog taken at the vipianus drive in tully heads this the crocodile issue which i 've been brought up on many occasions and i know that councillor baines has taken this on as a personal project and i 'll just ask him for a um update on where he is with that council mains thank you mr chairman and thank you councillor barnes for your question um we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of barnes and i do have the pleasure to announce that there is a clockwise round table being held in cairns on thursday the 22nd of july there will be representatives from queensland government from all the various departments who will help us deal in that space including des parks and wildlife service so there are key topics that are going to be discussed at this queensland wildlife app we also have a lot of the tourism operators attend um so the key discussion points around the table will be the newly launched uh queensland wildlife reported crocodile reporting act which has gone live and i 've i 've encouraged people before to please download the queensland wildlife app and that helps supply real-time information directly to the departments and residents can also have a look on the mapping and and see what 's been going on there is a review of the three-year crocodile met crocodile monitoring monitoring program that has been running for the last three years on numbers so we 'll be going through that data it was done in the same processes as were done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't think of the word for that one mr ceo they used the same method as previously to to keep that in place but there 's a lot of discussion around the new technology and new initiatives that may be used um there 'll be a lot of discussion around the new clockwise public safety initiatives there 's some new signage coming forward again a direct link to the wildlife the q wildlife app and there is a review going on at the moment as well of the crocodile management plan which was first put in place in 2017 i believe i i could be corrected on that 16 or 17. um so i would put a request out mr mayor to the community if they have some issues or some stories and they 'd like to um they 'd like me to bring them up at this clockwise round table it would be a great opportunity for the community to get in contact with me through council and it gives me issues to speak to we 'll have many ministers there and state representatives as well as the dgs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your question councillor barnes you 've done exceptionally well again mr mayor could i just speak also on a um point 8.1 asset rationalization and the ceo gets sick of me mentioning the name depreciation and he 's um he 's rattled me a few times but i think i 've got him this time mr man i 've done research from the um it 's a document from queensland treasury and i don 't think they tell stories it says here that why is depreciation really used depreciation expense is not a cash expense it isn 't is it is an accounting treatment to represent the value of an asset consumed during the period and it says here that um depreciation expense is an ex an essential component in outstanding the full cost of the services your council provides however it does not determine what you charge users for a particular service meaning as i 've been saying i 'll say it again you don 't charge depreciation on something that you 're not going to rebuild uh i 've got a few more articles here mr mayor i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retires he 'll leave a very smart man he will thank you through you mr chairman would you like the full response to that now i think the ceo has the right to reply um mr chairman the situation is this from 1936 until 91 or 92 the councils in queensland used what was referred to as a cash accounting system that is to say that depreciation was not dealt with the way that it is dealt with now in 1988 from memory it might have been 89 ed 42 exposure draft 42 was introduced which provided a framework which would later determine the way that local authorities deal with depreciation that was followed by australian accounting standard 27 at the time double is 27 which was entrapped in the new local government act as it was then in 92 there was a vigorous debate from 88 through to 92 many people within local government believed that depreciation should be dealt with by local governments the way that it is dealt with by everybody else that is not the case there are particular standards for application of depreciation in local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council can neither open nor close a road council does not own a road and council cannot derive an income from a road under normal circumstances it would therefore fall outside the scope of asset definition to continue depreciation is an expense which must be applied it 's true that a an individual club or a group does not have to have depreciation charge to it for the use of a facility but that would require that uh the rest of the rate payers would be paying for that depreciation in a nutshell um if depreciation is not funded um then it affects council 's equity it therefore goes on to affect councils sustainability registers and in a nutshell not the sustainability registers sustainability ratios and in a nutshell the way that this council has been dealing with depreciation has survived 13 audits now we 've had 13 unmodified audits in a row were we not to deal with depreciation in the manner we uh we use then i have absolutely no doubt that the auditor general would be alerted very quickly and alive to that issue and on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulting anybody i note that there is one qualified accountant in the room anybody else a qualified accountant have one qualified accountant in the room ms bradley who with your permission mr merrill invite to uh to make further comments now councillor barnes miss bradley 's going to step you through this plea please take note i think he 's getting a glass of water he 's getting some what he means well i think barry with your comments you 've made the understanding of the why for what depreciation is seems to be explained and commend you on your research and obtaining that qtc document which was going to be my recommendation to send to all councillors because it is quite valuable and informs um the the non-accountants of the world what depreciation is and why it 's used and applied according to accounting standards so i guess a couple of key things to understand with depreciation is we 've got legislative requirements as well as council policy which explains the why we we have depreciation why it exists we also have the what which is comes to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audit scrutiny which is our assurance around depreciation so from a legislative perspective we are regulated under local government act and the local government regulations to prepare general purpose financial statements so those general purpose financial statements must be in line with the australian accounting standards and it 's the australian australian accounting standards which dictates that depreciation must be recorded and assets must be depreciated so the objective of those general purpose financial statements is to provide information to primary users of those reports to support decision making so that 's the bare essentials of what our financial statements our purpose is so the role of the australian australian accounting standard board sets rules over the form and content of those statements including the account accounting treatment and the disclosure for particular types of transactions including depreciation which is in question currently so those requirements together with the opinion of our external auditor provide a mechanism to ensure compatibility and consistency across financial statements throughout australia and the world with the international financial reporting statements so the range of different accounting standards is issued by the australian accounting standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting standards and the international financial reporting standards so it 's consistent across the world so there 's a number of accounting standards which james referred to a number of those which i won 't bore you with a lot of them are not relevant to you so in addition to that council has adopted a asset accounting policy so this policy outlines the mandatory asset management accounting requirements um in accordance with the act and regulations that we just spoke about it also provides guidance clarity and consistency regarding the treatment of our capital expenditure depreciation revaluations impairment and disposals of our assets this policy was adopted by council on the 11th of march in 2021 prior to its first adoption in february 2020 it was also reviewed by council 's external auditors for reasonableness and was also reviewed by both asset management working group as well as the audit committee to ensure we have covered everything that we need to be covering in that so what is an asset so an asset is defined as a resource controlled by an entity as a result of past events and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entity so effectively the key requirements for an asset relates to control so the potential to receive a benefit or restrict a benefit or access to a benefit from the community a future economic benefit which is the probability that economic benefits or service potential will flow to council also whether it can be measured reliably also as a criteria of asset and physical substance if it 's part of an asset network etc so as you referred to the qtc document depreciation is the systematic allocation of a depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life which reflects the pattern in which the assets future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity so the depreciation was first introduced in 91 as mr got mentioned earlier depreciation expense provides an estimate of the amount of future economic benefit consumed during the year so the depreciation method used to determine the amount of depreciation also must match the expected patterns of consumption so in some assets where for example a piece of machinery that might be able to produce one million units of fluff say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the unit method so the volume of uh units being processed by the machine um however majority of councils will we use straight line depreciation across the useful life so the depreciation method must also be based on relevant factors with evidence of remaining service potential taking into account utilization wear and tear of the asset and obsolescence and council must appreciate only the depreciable amount which means that if an asset has any residual value so if we could sell it at the end of its life and retain you know for example a vehicle we could sell it and get say 10 grand back for that vehicle then we don 't depreciate that 10 000 that 's the residual value we also must appreciate the depreciable amount in a systematic way over the useful life and it must commence once that assets ready for use so once it can be utilized in whatever way that is depending on the asset type so the purpose of depreciation records the value or cost of the asset that has been consumed during the accounting period which is our financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discern information about council 's assets and our performance of our assets so the purpose is solely that of a key performance indicator in our financial statements and it 's not intended for any other purpose some entities have attempted to use depreciation for the purposes other than measuring the value of that asset consumed during the year for example as a measure of the amount of future funding required to replace an existing asset or as a mechanism for setting user charges or rates based on fully funded depreciation however there 's no direct link or relationship under the accounting standards between depreciation and either future funding needs or rate or as a rate setting mechanism any linkage is determined by council 's policies historical practices and the requirements to meet financial sustainability measures as council has a history and potential future of delivering balanced budgets um that is why we generally have a balanced budget and fund depreciation so council 's asset management plans are the tool that we have in place to determine our future funding requirements for our asset renewal program so that is our key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like local governments the fair value which is the sale price of land or some buildings and we also use current replacement costs how much it would cost to replace an asset of that non-current asset is typically around 95 percent of our balance sheet and depreciation expense is often reported in ranges between 15 to 40 percent of total expenses i think ours is sitting around 32 give or take so that 's across all local government entities so as council aims to produce a small operating profit profit the impact of misstatement of depreciation expense of the bottom line is highly material so that means if we didn 't apply it properly we could either have a significant surplus or a significant deficit and given the subjective nature of the calculations it poses an extreme audit risk as you can understand based on 95 of our balance sheet so in our local local local government regulations um it states that council 's financial statements must be audited annually and the auditor must obtain reasonable assurance as to whether our statements are free from material misstatement so the audit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comply with the accounting standards and present fairly the financial performance of council to do this the auditor conducts a number of tests and gathers sufficient evidence that fair value and depreciation expense and disclosures have been prepared in accordance with the accounting standards and supported by appropriate evidence and are materially correct inability to provide sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support that valuation would normally result in auditors issuing a modified audit opinion uh which effectively means that the application and processes and methodologies do not satisfy the requirements for accounting standards and there 's material material incorrect transactions in council 's financial statements so to date as james mentioned earlier council has had 13 consecutive unmodified audit opinions providing assurance to councillors and the community of council 's compliance with the australian accounting standards council 's policy and therefore applying the correct treatment of our depreciation we do have some opportunities in this space which council are obviously exploring at the moment which is reducing our asset base as part of our asset rationalization we 've got opportunities around reviewing maintenance programs to ensure maximum useful lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis on the maintenance programs versus extending the remaining useful life and updating that remaining useful life in our asset register we 've got opportunities around doing undertaking regular detailed reviews of our remaining useful life to ensure an accurate representation in the register assessment of economic or functional obsolescence on particular assets which we 've undertaken as you 're all aware of with our serious treatment plant with perry harvey jetty etc have been areas that council 's been exploring but however we could explore that further there may be a number of assets out there that could come under that same approach and also opportunities around increasing the volume of condition assessments or asset inspections to have a further refined approach to our maintenance programs this could identify further opportunity for changes in fair value or lower condition assets and remaining use for life extension so the key takeaways depreciation is an expense that must be recognized under australian accounting standards and legislation and is an estimate of the amount of future economic economic benefit consumed during the year depreciation is not a funding source for future asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether to renew an asset at the end of its life this is what our asset management plans and our long-term financial plans are full depreciation is used to calculate two of three of our legislated financial sustainability measures stated under local government regulations our financial statements provide information for decision making so around accurate depreciation reflects council sustainability it advises whether revenue is covering costs including using up council 's assets which is your depreciation provides evidence of council 's ability to sustain current levels of infrastructure and the impacts include the accurate depreciation affects our financial statements it affects council 's external audit opinion and also asset management plans are in place to determine future renewal funding requirements that 's all from my sophomore mr man you remind me never argue with her secondly um i just i appreciate your very educated response i just don 't as a counselor i 'd hate to see us get to the situation where our non-profit or sporting bodies can 't play a sport or have meetings because they can 't afford rent you know i know it 's all nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but uh i 've still got a little bit more to teach our ceo when i get later on but um yeah i 'd hate to get that situation where we 've got clubs folding because they can 't meet our requirements thank you all right yeah council millwood so through the chair so miss bradley i just um if we were incorrectly using the depreciation this would quickly be brought to our attention by the audit office i would think is that correct okay thank you any further questions for miss bradley i just want to summarize that council barnes that was a tko in the first round and your challenge to the ceo should be reconsidered i think she 's been waiting three months for me to ask that question thank you thank you mr bradley not a problem do you want a lot of reply no no no but but through you uh mr chairman i i thank the deputy mayor for his sagas and erudite comments and i do continue to learn from him not in respect of depreciation however through you mr chairman i i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responses to matters that were taken on notice uh at the last meeting so the first one is 8.1 the one that councillor barnes just addressed in respect to the tully caribbean park councillors will have seen i hope an email sent on the 24th of june um which addressed the comments made at the council meeting um the works in the uh tully caravan park um are in accordance with the master plan that was circulated in 2020 so that 's where it was ventilated to cancel uh originally um second one at 8.2 i think that had to do with the new new eating space the new eating spaces that was part of the open space renewal program not part of the asset rationalization program which is facilities based in respect of 8.5 kind support our colleague ms saffron um is we 'll schedule media release when the new guidelines are finalized the footpath that fits gerald esplanade there 's an expectation of completion at the end of this month weather permitting and in respect of 8.11 uh explaining or further ventilating how depreciation works that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put out for greater understanding of the uh the public to be achieved so that 's all of mine mr man thank you mr ceo any further business arising from those three sets of minutes okay we 've uh we 've had a move in a second for those so we now move on to item 3 community and culture 3.1 page 48 freedom of the town innisfail third combat service support battalion and the ceo will present this report thank you mr chairman thank you for the opportunity three mr chairman 2006 uh third combat service support battalion uh assisted innisfail in the cleanup after cyclone larry the battalion was under the command at that time of lieutenant colonel andrew bottrell as a result of that experience the men and women of the third bonded with families in the region a bond that was confirmed at the 2006 anzac day march and ceremony and uh was cemented when the mayor at that time uh councillor then councillor clark uh granted the battalion freedom of entry to the shire to the shower of johnson in september 2006 this freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march through the city led by lieutenant botrell three mr chairman lieutenant colonel steve young is now in command of the third and has asked cassary coast regional council as the successor of the shower of johnson and indeed uh cardwell shower if it would be willing to grant the third the honor of commemorating the original freedom of entry uh 5th of september 2021 this day is the battalion 's 30th birthday and it also marks 15 years in cyclone larry and the original parade in addition the third combat service support battalion has recently been granted theater on us for their efforts in east timor in iraq these need to be formally presented to the battalion and lieutenant colonel young can think of no better place to do this than the community so linked to their history it 's my recommendation therefore um through with your indulgence mr mayor the castro coast regional council extend uh freedom of the town of innisfail to the commanding officer officers and soldiers of the third combat support battalion uh thank you mr god any questions or comment from the ceo councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read 5th of december and i thought you said september i could be wrong if i said september i heard i apologize i meant to say december thank you i could be wrong i just that 's what i thought i heard make mistakes okay councillor thanks thank you mr chairman um i think the comment was the september when it was issued back in 2006 they 're coming back in december this year mr mayor i 've had a phone conversation with lieutenant colonel young the battalion is very proud of the works that they did in innisfail post cyclone larry i i don 't think defense can give them a battle honor for it but i think would be maybe it 's appropriate for us to do so i 'm not sure but i think it 's a great opportunity for us to once again recognize the significant efforts that all of our defence force personnel put towards our country it 's a great way for us to say i know they 're not happy in this country where we the americans thank them for their service australians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't find that very palatable a lot of the time but i think this is a great opportunity for us to bring the servicemen back now who weren 't probably with the battalion at the time and then they can keep this long running relationship with our area and they will continue to do it 's an excellent space for us to be in um i know there 's going to be a lot of to do and pomp and ceremony so i would encourage everybody when they 're when they turn up and they 're marching through the streets on the 5th of december come along and bring your flags mr mayor yesterday signified the last troops from afghanistan being removed from the last australian troops from afghanistan being removed from that theater after 20 years of operations so it 's a very poignant time and again i believe anyone who wears a defence force uniform in our nation or to receive our highest commendations and thanks thank you council bynes any further comments or questions for the ceo moved by councillor bain second by councillor bourbon all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to item four planning services 4.1 page 51 application for reduction infrastructure charges relating to an mcu and uh mr jones will present this report good morning everybody good morning mr jones through the chair council has received a request from mr paul zanter for a 100 reduction in the infrastructure charges relating to a material change of use for a medium-paid industry and warehouses being shared in offices situated at nine sheppard close mission beach the application was approved by councils subject to conditions on the 13th of may 2021 with infrastructure charges for the amount of five hundred and sixteen dollars and twenty five cents the proposed development is on land within the township zone greater mission beach industry precinct and meets the eligibility criteria outlined within the policy it is recommended the request for 100 reduction infrastructure charges be approved by council provided the development is completed prior to 18th of june 2024. happy to answer any questions council council chewie mr jones good morning this is an ongoing one for me i understand the um the charges issue i just still have issues with uh existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their landscaping and beautification of their premises can we give have an update on that and and i just feel that you know it there needs to be a further beyond just you know they need to follow all their recommendations through before they receive any reduction because the place that i 'm talking about is an entry to mission beach and it 's just not they have not lived up to what i believe they agreed to do and we i 'm getting commentary quite regularly about it so that 's my question comment thank you through the chair uh council chu we 'll continue to chase up that issue we know it 's a hot topic at mission beach and um we have commenced some enforcement action with the landholder in that case so we 'll continue to chase that up and hopefully i 'll be able to give you some better news at a further meeting thank you thank you any further questions from mr jones if not somebody moved the recommendation moved by councillor pervin seconded by councillor millwood all in favour it 's carried anonymously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to item five general business uh we 'll go through the normal general business and at the end uh the piece about yesterday 's meeting with the department of state development and queensland treasury the ceo desire is to go into a confidential session in general business so you get a full briefing on the details that we 're not allowed to make public we will then come out of the confidential and the prepared statement from the department of state development will be read out by myself so a little bit unusual i know and then we 've still got a confidential session later in the day but it is required because the details of yesterday 's meeting remain confidential to the general public and the ceo wants to share that with you in a private session so i 'll leave that to the very last item in general business any general business council chewie um just two things i 'd just like to take the opportunity to congratulate everybody who turned out in yesterday 's march on the naidoc um it wasn 't the weather conditions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd and uh congratulations to those that marched and and the people that made the effort in the park to to create activities and everything it was it was great to see and uh yeah it was great and once again mr ceo there are issues on facebook land that our meetings are not open to the public could you please again make it clear that we are accepting people to come and join our meetings and but there is a process and a protocol that they must go through if you could please explain again thank you thank you mr chairman thank you councillor chewie uh yes i give you my absolute assurance that the meetings are open to the public and have been for some time now which has been widely uh published through through our website we do have a restriction because of covid just as any other meeting wedding party funeral anything has restrictions as to numbers and we must abide with those restrictions as to numbers uh in this particular space we calculate that there 's room for about four attendees the process to pre-register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a few pre-registration pre-registrations however those people uh decided for whatever reason not to attend at the last moment so if someone pre-registered for the next meeting they 'll be installed into a seat at the back of the room appropriately physically distanced and can be in the meeting room i hasten to add counsellor terry that the attendants at uh council meetings typically is overwhelmed exponentially by the the viewing of our live streaming so i think it 's quite convenient for people to sit at home and live stream it at any time rather than needing to physically attend notwithstanding that they can thank you i just wanted clarification that they can whether they choose to or not is entirely up to the people but but they can thank you councillor tui i i appreciate you bringing the matter up because fake news on social media is saying that we 're the only council in queensland is shutting the public out no transparency corruption etc etc thank you for the question it 's made very clear by the ceo that our meetings are open we didn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everybody to follow and obey and we 're simply doing that this chamber had been measured by our staff and it was determined that a maximum of four could show up since we 've opened the meetings up we 've had one resident attend in person uh clearly most people are happy with the live streaming uh any other general business counsellor barnes just very quickly mr mayor just like that the public know that the contractor has started the owen street job for those who are unaware of owen street that 's the street in innisfail between coles and anzac park the councillors that 's earnest street mate is ernest street i 'm sorry yeah baines earner street is um between anzac park and kohl 's with councils very aware that it has to be done under as quick a time as possible and they started on monday and guess what happened monday at start of the rain so we 've got them on a time limit subject to rain thank you thank you council barnes council milwaukee yes through the chair i 've got a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets that have been built via grant funding and such all become assets of council as i 've had many questions in relation to buildings that have been built with prior grants and why are they now owned by council is my first question yeah three mr chairman it 's a condition of the grant funding the state and the federal government do not build facilities and and own and operate them they uh produce grants to councils and if councils take those grants um then a condition of uh accepting the grant is that the council accepts the the asset um it 's um inevitable and it 's always been that way mr good morning mr goodman uh through uh mr med the the only thing if i could add to that is if i if those structures or those uh that infrastructure that 's been built is built on council land that is the determining factor unless we have a formal lease which provides the ownership of those that infrastructure to that club so with if those things are not in place the standards require that that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the relevant accounting standards thank you and i 've got a few more you might want to stay mr goodman the other question is will we have plumbers etc on call for our show time in tully to assure that the grandstand runs up to its expectations and without disaster as a community is very concerned about the new facility toilets being able to cope uh the short answer is yes plumbers will be on call okay thank you and there 's one more that the communities also brought to my attention about the rationalization of the igloo and a vast um of the possibility of it to be put on a heritage list thank you uh i can through the chair i can just say that it is not heritage listed but if community it 's not a proposal of counsel um either of staff or as i 'm yet to hear from councillors of a strategy to have it heritage listed uh but i 've i 'm certainly not an expert on on the heritage process but i understand it does not require that uh council nominate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is anybody in the community that wants to go through that process that is open to them to go through that process thank you councillor thank you thanks uh mr mayor mr goodman following on from councillor milwards that would with your knowledge that you may or may not have would the igloo be likely to be a candidate for heritage listing do you know the criteria at all or mr gott uh yeah through you mr chairman it 's not not a local government process that 's determined by the the heritage council it 's a state function the heritage buildings legislation provides for a register of buildings which are heritage listed i don 't i 'm not in a position to give you the full criteria but i uh can comment that um generally speaking um buildings which have which are considered to have not considered by council but considered by um the determining body to have uh significant historical and they defined between historical and historic historical and or historic significance are potentially candidates whether that would be the case with this igloo or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't frankly i don 't know thank you and it was a good point council millwood so the community could in fact run with this if they if they felt passionate enough oh and three mr chairman an individual can make application thank you thank you uh just a comment on the heritage council they did visit our region about four or five years ago they met with community groups they met with councillors they met with our staff and they drew up a list of buildings that they deemed needed to be protected for example mia 's training and construction the old church of england church in south johnson that was branded with the heritage blessing ron and dan 's butcher shop in earnest street they pushed back hard against it and i don 't think it went ahead but certainly that was identified as a heritage-listed building but they were very active in our community and it 's interesting that they didn 't say the igloos should be on that list of theirs they didn 't put the igloo on their list but that doesn 't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try it so great great uh idea melbourne uh but let them do the legwork it 's not a council role uh any uh any further general councillor pervin yes thanks mr chair mr goodwin before you go anywhere um all right look i just want to ask mr goodman i 've noticed and i spoke at a council meeting some time ago about our way finding signs and mr goodman said that they had arrived when will they be constructed mr goodman i thought we had an answer on that last time we 're waiting for the contractors can you please give me an update otherwise can we get into doing myself sorry apologies for that um i 'll go through that again uh through the chair councillor pervin the last update we received uh from um sign was on the 25th of june um that [Music] they did provide at that time an updated timeline at lining the works provided and the timeline should have concrete footings for the new signs completed next week um obviously there has been some weather conditions that would be uh im impeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was provided on uh 25th of june had completion of the project uh in the week of ninth of august uh and within that program they had allowed two weeks of contingency for wet weather so we will continue to monitor the progress of the of arm sign and delivering the uh and delivering the project uh in accordance with their updated programmer works the week of 9th of august is is the current program for completion council chewie thank you for raising that council permit mr goodman um i attended a local meeting and members of the community were quite keen once the i have spoken to mr jones about this um just wanted to share it with everybody um members of the community were keen to add beautification like gardening and stuff once the signs were installed obviously in keeping with council plans and mr jones obviously it would be a tmr thing but is that is it possible for the community to to work with gardening to make the entryways to our towns better it is possible um counselor chewie one of the things to keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things we have seen at some stages in the past in some areas is a few groups get together with the best of intentions and create gardens or create something uh that is about promoting an attractive entrance uh to a township uh and and then um stop maintaining it uh and and it can become unsightly or reflect badly or reflect poorly on on the community uh if there are sorts of community initiatives that don 't have ongoing uh commitment to maintenance of them but yes the short answer is yes we can certainly consider a process if there was a well thought out proposal to do additional works something like a garden bed to add to the entrance way or entrance to our communities then yes we can support that thank you i 'll take it back to the to the group thank you thank you council jury uh council milwaukee through the chair yes i noticed that there is a matchbox film company hanging around town at the moment and i just like to say that i had involvement with um the past production of sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the set as a set nurse for quite a few seasons and i just like to say that this is a very positive thing in my eyes that the productions do bring a lot of economic benefit to our areas so i 'll be happy to see all this happening in the near future thank you council millwood any further general business council good news piece that was really well caught there thank you mr chair good news piece there has been a lot of angst around the boat ramp work at the coconuts that was performed with a contractor under a dtmr contract i am happy to say that the boat ramp is up and operational the works that have been done by the contractor under dtmr are just excellent so when the weather comes good and you want to get your boat out the coconut boat ramps is back operational and running again thanks mr mayor thank you council bones need further general business um a couple of things uh the fortnightly update of uh hadwell park that was tallied up yesterday by our staff seven thousand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand five hundred and ninety seven so to the people in the community who said that grey name as don 't spend in our economy uh there 's the evidence so that 's only cmca that 's not the river drive council park which is chock-a-block at the moment we 're not telling there but certainly uh the grey nomads are contributing to our community excuse me thank you for cancer chewie uh yeah and obviously thank you mister it 's great and i 'm assuming that would not be everybody not everybody 's putting receipts in so there 's even more to add to that tally so thank you good point council chewie if you go and they do they go to paranella park and mummy canopy walk you don 't get a paper receipt there so they don 't get popped in the box uh brothers are picking them up with a courtesy bus take them down for dinner lunch uh they don 't bring back the seats and follow them in the pizza man delivers to the cmca park uh those receipts don 't so there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly that 's just an example of the spend that is occurring which is great for our economy thank you for the introduction on matchbox i do have a breaking news item and here we go it 's long-winded so bear with me our council staff have been working behind the scenes with the proponents of a media project for some time now but have been bound by agreements to remain confidential i am very pleased to to publicly announce today that production of a 10 part tv series irreverent is about to commence in our region matchbox is a prolific film and television production company with offices in sydney adelaide melbourne australia it makes world-class content for global audience its credits include leading international adult dramas stateless the heights glitch safe harbour seven types of ambiguity secret city wanted the slap and children 's dramas nowhere boys and mustangs fc matchbox is also currently in production of a new eight-part drama clickbait for netflix the company is the one one of the most credentialed and awarded producers in australia it has won international emmys pre du jour a ba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the australian academy of cinema and television art awards and logies in nbcu universal international studios company matchbox has produced more than 50 titles working in every network in australia and various international buyers and commissioners universal studio group which comprises universal television universal content productions and nbc universal international studios will bring three productions to queensland young rock currently in production in southeast queensland joe exotic and a revlon leveraging its local expertise and infrastructure matchbox pitchers will lead and oversee these three projects on the ground a revlon is a 10-part tv series that centers around a chicago criminal who is forced to assume the identity of a church reverend in a tropical australian beach town in order to stay hidden and stay alive while it becomes clear to the town that he 's got some unusual ways the fake reverend manages to bumble through weddings funerals and everything else that 's thrown at him as he tries to maintain his cover in time he manages to capture the heart of the town just as the town captured his heart irrelevant is ultimately a show that about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to us all after many location surveys around far north queensland mission beach was chosen as the for a number of reasons the natural beauty of the place and is the obvious reason some of the crew have fond memories of how mission beach community welcome the production during hell and die mcelroy 's seat patrol other smaller productions have filmed in the region the past couple of years the production will provide invaluable opportunities for australian cast and crew in addition to opportunities in other industry sectors such as post-production digital and visual effects business engagement of workers in construction transport accommodation and hospitality and opportunity in training crews sourcing of cast and crew housing and accommodation has commenced and many properties already booked for the coming months working five day week crew will have some down time to take advantage of the fantastic tourism activities in our region as it is reasonably long shoot a lot of the crew have already made plans for their families to come with them local businesses in the region will benefit and the number of people in town accessing and patronising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the proposed areas of filming may limit access and amenity to the general public and locals alike however these measures are temporarily in nature and any areas assessed will be restored at completion of filming if the series is successful it is hoped the production will come back to the region annually to film additional series with the current covert restrictions this is a great opportunity to showcase category coast to national and international viewers and producers alike and as location offering fantastic locations to equal anywhere in the world but with the added benefit of a film film-friendly and proactive region when appropriate the production has committed to hosting small groups of school students studying media and arts to set to watch proceedings matchbox has committed to keeping the community informed at all times particularly when they are planned road closures night filming or special effect and minimising disruption to the community wherever possible preliminary crew will start arriving in mission beach mid-july with the main crew arriving last week of august and in town until mid-november it is anticipated that towards the middle end of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art department with construction arriving 19th of july and work will commence measuring up and construction of the set build location as early as the 26th july an art department construction space has been rented and a lot of initial prefab construction will start their first part of the production 's requirements involve filming on public land matchbox has proposed they undertake community notification in conjunction with advice from council via public notices and social media to officially inform them of the production activities i move therefore one that council welcomes the cast and crew of revlon to our community and we look forward to the many benefits that this project will deliver to our region in the short medium and long term two that council actively encourages residents of the kashmir coast to welcome the cast and crew of a riven to our community three that council facilitates the filming of this tv series as required on public land subject to appropriate community notification by matchbox and appropriate effort is applied in reducing the impact to the community so moved uh do we have a second second by councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the chair yeah again myself and jeff was uh councillor baines was also involved in um production of sea patrol when it was here and the economic benefits to the local businesses and stuff was really outstanding i can say yeah thank you thank you councilman councillor probably another great point to follow on through thank you mr chair the council of millwood mentioned is the producers and line producers are experienced in our area initially when sea patrol first kicked off they didn 't really have much of an idea of the capability of a lot of our businesses and engineering groups and suppliers within the region they are well aware of those connections now so i think any new businesses that have kicked up that may be able to assist in the production of equipment or any of the things that the the crews need maybe i don 't know if they get in contact with the production company directly and let them know what they do because again cassary coast the heart of the wet tropics the birthplace of the great barrier reef and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the film industry should be using the people that are here locally and they do appreciate that already mr miss so the economic benefit is is just can go beyond your imagination it 's huge thank you council bynes further to that we are covert free and clearly the film industry is looking at this area uh the recent purchaser of dunk island has made it very clear to the ceo and i in our conversations that his vision will be for dunk island will be measured by what the community wants and we made it clear we want local jobs for our kids so further than hospitality further than tourism mark spillane has a vision of a film hub on dunk island fits in hand in glove with what we just read out so it 's all happening in cashery coast one coast cashery coast any further comments on that wonderful news mr ceo through you mr chairman uh just to uh recognize the uh efforts of mr uh the the uh efforts and um contribution um of mr goodman uh behind the scenes if you 'll pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to this point thank you [Music] we got the good news from mr goodman while we 're having lunch at bang and grind yesterday and uh i just just put that out there that 's where we were uh okay uh any further general business oh we 've got a mover all in favor carried unanimously thank you and i concur with the ceo um thank you to the staff who 've done a great job behind the scenes uh pulling this off and uh it 's going to be wonderful for our economy and our and our young kids wanting jobs no doubt about it uh mr ceo yep um we now go into confidential and general business sorry i do believe you haven 't yet missed me we 're now going in general business so the ceo can give everybody a briefing on what happened with uh department of state development in queensland treasury yesterday and then we 'll come out of confidential and i 'll read the prepared statement that 's been forwarded to us by the government uh with somebody sorry so just before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated from the next conference yes it 's a general basis okay so the reason we 're going in what the reason we 're closing the meeting to the public is to discuss the confidential details of yesterday 's meeting with the state government and we 'll come out i 'll read the prepared statement and then we will go back into kim camera or close the meeting to the public to discuss two other confidential items and through somebody three mr chairman the reason um that council may um deal with this on a confidential basis is firstly because of the commercial in confidence nature of the negotiations and the pursuant legal instruments that will be negotiated so there 's provision under our legislation for council to make that decision like with somebody move that we close the meet in the public moved by council jewish second and by council millwood all in favor carried unanimously okay councillors would uh somebody move that we reopened the meeting to the public moved by councillor pervin seconded by councillor chewie all in favor carried unanimously thank you i 'll just hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out this prepared statement from the state government thank you mr chairman with your permission uh councillors uh the mayor and uh i met with uh senior staff very senior staff from a number of state government departments yesterday together with the member for hinchinbrook mr nick de meadow our discussions were based on a uh without prejudice um based on a without uh prejudice agreement which was uh honored and in the closed section i believe that between the mayor and myself the councillors have sufficient information so that they can reasonably assess the message that the mayor is about to deliver in a moment and through you mr chairman i would ask the councillors if they don 't believe they 've been sufficiently apprised of information then please say so now and we can remedy that i 'm taking that as a no through you mr chairman uh it was also impressed upon the councillors and the staff that the details of the discussion and the negotiations that were held yesterday uh highly confidential and will not go beyond the bounds of the discussion which council had um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i invite you to uh to proceed uh thank you mr ceo for that introduction uh this week representatives of the castro coast regional council met with the state local member nick dimetto and representatives of the queensland government to discuss the way forward in resolving the port hintonbrook matters the meeting was very productive with all parties coming to an in-principle agreement to immediately start working together to resolve these matters which will lead to the normalization of the poor attention rook development as part of the meeting there was a focus on the principles of simplicity timeliness risk management and for the work and for the work the council and state would do over the coming weeks it was acknowledged that given the longevity and complexity of this matter that a staged but timely approach to issue resolution was important the most pressing issue requiring resolution to get to the normalization of land assets in particular the sewage treatment plant the importance of normalizing the port engine book development is that in doing so it unlocks a new opportunity for the kashari coast this is a positive step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prepared by the state government as agreed in our meeting yesterday one source of truth and that 's how we 'll proceed going forward given that councillors i move that council is formally endorsed sorry sorry mr chairman i 'm terribly sorry please forgive me for interrupting but i i wanted to emphasize that what you just said referred to the land the normalization of land assets so this in principle agreement is absent of any reference to one mile creek or the uh or the potential dredging of same what we 're talking about here is the land asset so it 's a key word in what you just said if you don 't thank you for the clarification on that mr ceo uh councillors i move formally i move councillors formally endorse the without prejudice support for the in principle agreement on port hendren book development second second by councillor barnes any questions or comments

program five tenders were received and the recommendation um through the evaluation uh was to engage rp spray rpq spray seal who undertook last year 's reseal program with four council so

morning mr smart morning councillors uh councillors this uh item uh relates to a water concession for a property at pigeon hill this particular property has previously had a concession awarded to it on the basis that there appears to have been some evidence that a failing pressure reducing valve that council operates may not have been functioning correctly and the property may have been seeing higher than desirable pressure at the water meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that there had been a failure in the following uh rating period and after the the owner received that bill they made application for a further concession it 's acknowledged that the repair work was ta undertaken to our prv after the leak so there are grounds i believe for this concession and i 'd be recommending that we uh replace the uh the charge for the period uh the second of the six 2020 to first to 12 2020 with uh a charge of 205.75 uh in lieu of what was uh initially rated thank you mr smart any

activity report and mr blanchett will present this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callery report as read i 'll just skim through some of the highlights uh which are in the executive summary some of our interactions with local tourism organisation and regional tourism organisation and we 've started early with a bit of work on some of the the larger destination events so just coming through the ports it touches on some of our activation with the family things to do for the school holidays just a bit of a hit list of things to do for families brought out in advance the summer holidays we have a events calendar designed for visitors to highlight events to do around the region uh the the key thing on that is a pdf that hyperlinks directly to the local event so and markets are on there as well on the bottom of that uh bit of digital a quick mention of the cable manabyte project is from left field flow magazine showed interest in the project so there 's quite a lot of exposure for kabul and the region as a sort of side benefit of that project mentioning events it 's very early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event we had uh interest from the innisfail chamber of commerce commerce in december so just an early meeting on that we 've had our first project meeting but the rubber won 't really hit the road on that for a little while until we get closer to the event rear bull defiance also uh they 've opened entries on that and their team this reports october to december but just to add their team are on the ground this week so again detail will start to come through in the following months on the red bull defiance some important [Music] meetings with the ceo of td and q so this is a regular contact in collaboration with our local industry through the lto with tt and q to leverage opportunities for the region and keep on track with our strategic direction included in the report is a note on tct 's agm and their renewed board noting council mcleod is also on that board representing the council tct also seen as a quality report so included in this is an overview of the season as presented by tct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detail the the overview taken it has red skims through some of the highs and lows of the seasons and challenges when we 're busy such as [Music] limited services and experiences available when we have a lot of people in our in our towns uh something to work on with destination development they also note some of the media coverage which we 've touched on the coolest place to be the summer before you 'll note there was some print advertising with that so quite heavy um profile and cairns and townsville in the post and the bulletin there 's also some tv commercials that have been playing over the season that we 'll get the metrics on those for the next quarterly report very important to mention we did our annual thank you to the special people from our community that volunteer in the visitor centers which is much appreciated by them as much as we appreciate their service to their local communities finally just the statistics have gone to a graph version so it 's a bit more visual so just quickly the three graphs there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a side note it represents between five to six percent of our total visitors but on that graph month by month you can see the visitation into each of our centers which are colour coded the line graphs above actually are the total for that month this year compared to last year for the same period there 's also a breakdown of where our tourists have been coming from over the last two financial financial years in the first six months of this year so you can see a breakdown by queensland by total domestic total australia and international and um two highlights out of that are the growth in the queensland visitation and the loss of the international market which we feel over this summer season finally we count the conversations and the visitor centers we don 't count the people that walk in and out the door we we count that when we have a conversation so the final graph is a highlight of what those conversations are about the key number there is the 36 that are asking us about things to do because that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay longer and connect with our experiences uh without let 's sort of summarise the report and present council to note uh thank you mr blanchett any questions for the officer councilmember through the chair uh hang on councilman with council macleod first cab off the rank sorry thank you through the chair i just want to mention um the great work tct are doing they are the voice of tourism for our region so i am encouraging businesses of every aspect um to join and reap the best of that membership um like mr blanchard had mentioned the coolest place to be this summer magazine was distributed there was over 35 000 copies sent out and we have now welcomed international travellers back to australia i do want to thank our visitor information center volunteers they do a great job promoting our area and um targa town has now been registered to the castle coast region which is a a huge win for us which is really really great and um on a good night we have met with red bull defiance uh this week and um they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is definitely going to be the adventure of a lifetime hearing what they do um and there will be more information to come soon in the next few months thank you council macleod council milward yeah through the chair um because this report has matters that may need further formal consideration for resolution i 've just got a few questions in in relation to the cardboard pump track um richard are you a mountain bike enthusiast yourself mr blanchett yep through the chair councillor millwood um just knowing the report 's not referring to the pump track but um in my personal life i have ridden a mountain bike can do on occasion yes okay no worries um i just want to refer to the grant monies um are we sure they will comfortably cover all the costs required and can we be assured that there 'll be no overspend wrong uh council mclaren we 're going to be voting on the pump track later probably the most appropriate because that is a confidential item could you hold your questions for the officer during that item please yeah sure thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair um i know it is in the current uh month of january but mission beach were proudly took a title of uh the most one of the top 10 in the most livable villages um would you like to comment on that i know i did speak on the radio about it i know mr bluett patrick spoke on it as well and um it 's it 's a great outcome helps to put mission beach further on the map and obviously the cassava coast too so if you 'd like to add anything about that yes through the chair thank you councillor um yeah this is a great tag for the whole region i guess our leading tourism name is mission beach and that number five villages around the world is pretty impressive to give you an idea number six was queenstown in new zealand which is arguably one of the adventure capitals of the world so as a nature adventure destination it is a really good tag but i think the key hollow for us as a destination is its measured of the customer so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching or asking about in the digital world so it can 't be led by the destination so somehow our awareness is reaching good places thank you yes i did have after i spoke on the radio i had actually a couple people text me that lived interstate uh commenting on the uh on the on the you know the story which i think was great because that will obviously help spread our our brand further further afield thank you thank you council chewie any further questions for the officer uh councillor pervin yeah mr chair just a quick one um it 's on the tourism side has nothing to do with this report but just recently i was out at the driver reviver in innisfail and we have two big sign boards up there i noticed one is by the inner style chamber of commerce and one was by the table anne 's regional council the taylor lands regional council signed to my understanding they 've just let it go into surrey it 's just it 's pretty poor condition but um i 'd like to see us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation what it would cost us to fix the structure of the sign and possibly get a skin put over it for 102 things to do in the cassowary coast it 's a very big signboard i know the frame does need a bit of work but i think up in the situation there where it is a lot of people pull over there it is a rest stop the rest stop won 't be going anywhere i think it 's a good opportunity for us to take advantage of this sign and at least get some costings back to the council and see if we 're prepared to go ahead with it uh council bourbon can we take that on notice and uh obviously it 'll be a budget consideration you 're happy with that for our officers to take that action very hard okay thank you any further questions yes councilman through the chair i notice in the report the um visitor information centres i would also like to sincerely express my appreciation for those volunteers who go and work in those visitor information centers because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you council millwood uh any further questions for the officer if not would somebody move the recommendation that the report be received and noted moved by councillor barnes seconded by councilman cloud all in favour it 's carried uh council millwood you 're voting in favor yeah in favour yeah carry unanimously thank you uh thank you mr blanchett we move on to item four governance environment and finance item 4.1 page 50 council policies and miss kerr will present this report good morning everybody good morning good morning today um we have two new uh one new policy one new guideline and two revised policies so council is introducing a new policy titled park and street furniture donation and memorial park policy which enables the community to apply to council for the donation locality installation and maintenance of donated park and street furniture or memorial plaques we also have an amended council meeting standing orders and procedures policy which has a new item in that for public question time public question time will commence from the 1st of april 2022 and the guideline is attached which provides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government meetings for public question time i 'll just quickly run through some of the changes to the policies the order of business in the council meetings policy has been amended to include public question time and merit minutes quickly turn over the mayoral minutes um the mayor may by assigned a minute introduce a matter within the jurisdiction or official cognicans of the council which is not on the agenda so that 's an inclusion in the policy i 've updated the amendment to motion section of the policy and also you 'll see at the end of the document the public question time inclusion of that so the guideline is included in the agenda for people that are interested and there 'll be an application form online sometime in march as well as hard copies at our customer service centers for people to apply for public question time the expenses reimbursement for councillors policy is an annual review and has no changes today and lastly as i mentioned earlier the public uh sorry the park and street furniture donation and memorial park policy and that application form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early next week are there any questions thank you miss kerr any questions for the officer councillor baines no if i can turn this on mr chair not a question just just some comments i mean i just want to commend the governor 's team of course government rocks and commend vanessa on the great amount of work she 's done in this space with without officers of the caliber and scope of miss kerr and and miss slattery these sort of works wouldn 't be coming forward a lot of this stuff is just amending things as we go that sometimes they get picked up in lead legislation or regulation changes that the final item is a great piece because it was it 's something we didn 't really address as a policy piece so i 'd just again like to commend the staff great work and further to that i would move the motion moved by council of and second divided councillor chewie thank you miss kurt just a question through the chair with the um park and street furniture donation i know uh it can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody who 's passed who have a popular favorite seat on a riverbank or for sure so council will work with people or groups or organizations to find the best place are we looking to replace existing furniture if that came along if it was a bench or a seat or something like that i 'm sure it 's in the guidelines but if we just have some clarification i 'd be grateful thank you through the chair look the uh thanks counselor the purpose of the policy is really you know to put some standards and conditions um in place and put a formal structure around that so previously we haven 't had a formal structure so there is an application form um but it is also to make sure that those donations or all those plaques keep with the area 's aesthetic and they also align with our corporate plan our asset management plans and and other strategic documents so it certainly is a process where officers would work with those individuals and we would ensure that there 's a balance there that we are meeting the needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate documents any further questions i just want to make a comment about the um public question time guideline the change to our standing orders uh this this time nicely with the relaxation of covert mandates there is some criticism in the community that our meetings are closed they 're not they 're restricted down to four because of the covered restrictions uh the premier 's indicated mass off in a week 's time and when we come to the march meeting i believe we 'll have further social distancing as well that means we can fit more people into this room so public question time is going to make uh ourselves and now officers open to our rate payers in terms of uh face-to-face uh opportunities and and as long as they submit their questions uh in a timely order so the staff can prepare an answer on the day uh i think this will be a great introduction to our new procedures going forward and i commend the staff for bringing the recommendation to us for consideration are there any further comments or questions for miss kerr we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council chewie all in favor council millwood yes okay that 's in favor that 's unanimous thank you uh we move on to item 4.2 page 94 the finance report and mr jennings is going to present this report uh mr jennings this is your first uh report to council uh welcome you on board uh i hope you enjoy the journey and we look forward to your expertise and helped prepare the upcoming budget over to you thanks for that i appreciate that so um i 'm presenting the january finance report i 'm presenting the january finance report and it 's so that it reports on council 's financial position at the 31st of january and as you 're aware um council is required to have financial reports tabled to them on a monthly basis so at 31st of january the operating statement shows that council is currently 1.9 million under budget and this is due to operating revenue being slightly down by 130 000 whilst operating expenditure is favorable by over 2 million and the reason for these variances can be seen on the in the um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downs especially in revenue with um the main ones being fees and charges which is we 've actually got more income in at this at the end of january operating grants of um we 're over half a mill favorable but we don 't expect to get any more budget so that 's just because we 've received funding earlier than what we expected also sales and recoverables are down at the moment but we 're still projecting to reach budget and the main variation that 's affecting the operating revenue at the 31st of january is what 's called internal revenue and that 's down by close to a million dollars but if you offset that in expenditure by internal expenses it brings it down to about 750 so at the moment it 's not an issue and because it 's internal it 's not too much to worry about so with um operating expenditure you 'll see that employee expenses are well under budget and this is due to the timing of the first pay run in february so that the days at the end of january @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in this report so that nine seven one thousand is actually overstated so the variance isn 't actually that large in employee costs and the employee costs because there 's a number of vacancies it 's offset by over expendituring contract labor as um mainly operation in the operational departments where where they need to replace vacancies with contract labor materials and services are well under budget but that 's basically timing issues and in the last five months we 'd expect that to that variance to actually reduce so that is the operating statement and we are say we are still projecting to end with a slight surplus of about 12 000 so if i move on to capital so firstly with capital grants we are actually 1.8 million under budget but once again this is a timing issue as we expect by the end of the year to receive the 8 million in funding so the capex report the budget 49.7 mill with um expenditure today at 18.9 million and this um represents approximately 39 of the capital works project i mean capital works program so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 million carry forward projects from last financial year but um in saying that we are still projecting to reach 49.6 million by the year end the other the other important part of the report is um the cash balance and it 's something we should focus on as well as our operating performance so at 31st of jan our bank balance is quite healthy with just under 40 million so that 's good um so that wraps up the january finance report if you have any questions please fire away yes i have a question ah yeah okay council millwood through the chair um i noted that the increased cost of contract labor there does council see the need to reduce the cost in contract labor and divert this back to normal practices uh the ceo who thinks that he answered that question uh through the chair counsellor there is a uh there is an underspend at the moment in our um our salaries and wages and uh those uh reduction in staff there through some vacancies are being offset through an increase in contractors so the net outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our salaries and wages um council officers are acknowledging that um there is we are in a busy period of the year and we do have a large capital project uh capital program to deliver uh along with our normal operational activities so uh those those offsets and they will be uh probably further recognized in our rb2 report that mid-year review are currently just offsetting yeah reductions in our staffing numbers so we have got a number of roles that are currently advertised and some of those vacancies have been through the the crew by function change that uh that 's being implemented at the moment so i 'm pleased to say that uh that a number of those roles uh have now been internally filled through crew by function and uh we have got a number of labour and operator roles out to market at the moment so we should anticipate to see that contra expense reduce over the second half of the year but we should also see some adjustment there in our salary and wages as that shift occurs thank you so yeah so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the need for contract the uh through the chair that yeah the workload stays steady uh we are seeing that that shift at the moment and and we are um yeah there is like i said there 's a number of positions that are currently advertised there 's a number of that have been uh recently offered and filled so you will certainly see that that start to adjust moving into or through q3 and into q4 yep thank you thank you council millwood any further questions for mr jennings if not would somebody move that the report be received and noted moved by councillor bain seconded by councillor barnes all in favour yeah councilmember that 's unanimous thank you we move on to item 4.3 page 108 the rb2 budget review and mr jennings will present thank you so um part of the council 's financial management um we conduct budget reviews quarterly so the second budget review was based on 31st of january figures so the the way it was conducted was that the finance um team went out to managers and directors to get their input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget so from that process there were some minor adjustments between account groups and so there was actually um a projected increase in revenue but this was offset by an increase in expenditure so the overall effect of the budget review is that council is still budgeting to um have a result of just under 12 000 at this stage now at the end of march there 'll be another budget review done and that figure should change and it will give us um a more accurate figure of where we 're projecting to to be by 30th of june so the um the budget review also incorporated a review of the current capital works program and that also resulted in the recognition of additional revenue but obviously that is offset by um extra expenditure so the funding would be for the additional expenditure so once again um we 're still forecasting to reach um just under 50 mil in the capital works program and included in the report is the long-term financial plan based on um 31st of jan figures and [Music] if you haven 't already had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indication of where council is projecting to be in the upcoming years based on our operating budget and our capital works budget and um i 'd strongly focus looking at the cash flow statement as well so you can understand what our cash balances will be in um future years based on our current um operating projections and capital works so in the um capital works budget um there was an increase in um ted 's funding for culverts of 330 000 and there was a deferral of mission beach drainage of 1.3 mills so that 1.3 mil has been transferred to reserves um there was part of the additional funding was for cctv cameras it was small funding amount 19k but it 's better than nothing as and the aerodrome fencing um additional 77k and um our i.t capital um works we have relocated 50 k to the intranet renewal project bought a serene waste no change at all um the operating statements so the main changes here as i said at the start it 's just more so a reallocation of funds between account groups so fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 're projecting about an extra five thousand um the big one is um in other revenue sources where we 're expecting to get an additional million compared to um budget review number one and sales and recoverable works we 're also expecting to get additional income but in saying that we have um projections for additional expenditure so as was mentioned in the previous report employee expenses apparently well below budget so that 's been recognized in the budget review and it 's been reduced accordingly and to offset that the contract labor projections have increased [Music] to um account for the over spend and the fact that we will still recruit require contract labor for the vacancies that we have and obviously if we fill vacancies there 's still a time gap between when they actually start on the ground materials and services there 's an extra 100k there which um we 're projecting to spend as well so yeah as i said the budget review no change to the bottom lines but um and i strongly suggest that you do have a look at the long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh councillor chewie thank you through the chair i 'm not sure this is for mr jennings or one of the directors just regarding the cctv cameras i 'm just wondering where they might be placed if they 're cbd or if they 're part of the illegal dumping campaign thank you um through the chair councillor tui the cctv is an installation at the at club point uh we 'll assist officers in in management of that facility and was agreed to be paid for by dtmr as the asset owners down there thank you mr goodman uh any further questions for the officer councillor barnes ah yes mr mayor after doing a deep dive into this report i think um now with a slight increase which is projected in interest which will be a positive for this council and also the lifting of covert will also be a positive as um if anyone looks into what covert over the last two years has cost this council it 's it 's just you know too much so i think with the lifting of the covert and if we don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very positive platform thank you councilman any further questions for the officer councillor baines um not a question mr mayor again i 'd like to congratulate mr jennings on his first presentation to the council today um thank you not all people see finance as the really sexy stuff um it can be a bit dry but i think you handled it well and i i see that um the bottom line is not changing on this stuff there 's variations on the way through and any sort of organisation of course has to be agile on its feet as we 're moving through so uh further to that mr mayor i would move the recommendation seconded by council barnes all in favor council millwood yes in favor that 's unanimous thank you very much thank you mr jennings we move on to item 4.4 page 126 related party disclosure and ms slattery will present this report good morning mr marin councillors okay today i have the pleasure of presenting the related parties disclosure uh policy which we have reviewed so the purpose of the policy is just to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related party disclosures the policy is developed to provide council with some guidance around ensuring that we have appropriate systems in place to capture the related party disclosure information and transactions and to ensure that we do this in a timely efficient and reliable manner we use this information to disclose these transactions as part of our annual report process just to note that related party transactions are considered to be a normal feature of commercial and business activities i don 't propose to go through the policy you guys should be well aware of its content but i do want to just bring your attention to the proposed changes that are outlined in the report so on page 132 of your pack highlights what the changes are and it 's around when key management personnel are required to fill out a declaration for council so currently the trigger points for for kmps to to fill out this form is uh january each year and then also at the end of financial year so that 's currently what is in place what the uh we are proposing to change that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to to fill out these declarations at the commencement of employment and also at the commencement of higher duties so if we have individuals that are moving up into a k p position that they are also required to fill out this declaration at that point in time so that is on top of the january and the end of financial year requirements and it just tightens up that process so that we are aware of those transactions and we 'll actually are we are aware of the relationship so the other item i want to point uh councillors to uh that is not obvious in the report but it 's on page 129 and it talks about defines who key management personnel are so for this council in the current policy it talks about that the kmps are identified as elected members so councillors yourselves the ceo the directors the cfo it is also mentioned the executive manager in the current definition but as we know the executive manager role currently doesn 't exist in the organization structure so we just need to take that out as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual form that is required to be completed so that is your declaration form for related parties it 's there just to really you know who who are your related parties that um there 's a definition and there is guidance in terms of fact sheet um around that definition so who are your close family members what who are they um and also who are your related parties from a an entity point of view through trusts companies etc so the recommendation that we put to you today is that council adopt the following documents for a period of two years or as determined from time to time by council or the chief executive officer those documents are policy fin0222 related party disclosure the related party declaration by key management personnel and the cassery coast regional council fact sheet related party disclosure for keep management personnel happy to take questions thank you miss lottery any questions for the officer councillor bones thank you mr chair probably one question ms slattery i mean and we speak about so we 've included that when people start employment we can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two natural six month periods uh where we get a reminder and you know make sure that we 're up to date there 's nothing to stop people in between those periods and they ought if there 's any change they all put that forward in another application or another form in the meantime is that right that 's correct if if any kmps are aware of their change in circumstances of who their related parties are then they should automatically um you know approach finance and update their declaration so um but yeah there 's i guess it 's just a reminder with the six months intervals but also at those other two trigger points but yes if there 's a change um do that as soon as soon as you know about it thank you thank you mr larry any further questions if not have a mover please councillor baines seconded by councillor pervin all in favor council milwaukee yep let 's carry unanimously thank you we move on to item 4.5 page 143 supporting agribusiness feral animal aerial shooting mr saddler will present thank you mr chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the um at the start of this meeting so uh on the third of february the federal pig executive oversight group um met in relation to the funded program under the panama tr4 in relation to eradication of feral pigs to support the banana industry uh at that time uh there was a closeout of that project and got to the end in a reallocation of any additional funding to back to industry successes from that was eradication of over 10 000 feral pigs from the region and obviously which contributes to a reduction in the spread of the panama tr4 disease for the banana industry there was an increased relationship between the peak industry bodies and government agencies and working together on a catchment-based approach and then in addition to that some advocacy for coordinator approach for biosecurity for the region since then and obviously with some media in recent times and discussion with uh peak industry bodies uh the feral pig issue continues to be an issue for our region and uh at a from a recent discussion with cane growers there has been an impact and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times from pig on the cane industry most recently the australian banana growers council has um eradicated about 75 pigs from an aerial shoot as well as in the north the individual cane growers have done a shoot and got about 38 pigs as detailed in the report with the i suppose the state and commonwealth funding drying up industry bodies have been asking for some additional support from council in relation to the feral pigs so what you have in front of you today is a proposal um to reallocate some funding under the natural environment operation budget of ten thousand dollars to support uh peak industry bodies of uh innisfail cane growers tully cane growers abgc and the cassery coast banana growers association in relation to a quick knockdown aerial shoot with that also is a reformation of an executive oversight group for the region and looking at some future allocation in relation to supporting those peak industry bodies the details in the report and the recommendations are just to one reaffirm the support for agribusiness peak industry bodies in the region reallocate ten thousand dollars from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerial shooting with peak industry bodies uh reform the executive oversight committee and request the ceo for preparation of the future coming budget for funding allocation to support the federal oversight group thank you mr satellite any questions councillor baines um thank you mr mayor and probably just a couple of points to make um mr sadler mentioned the half a million dollars of cane damage and that 's that 's data that 's only come out of innisfail cane growers so i believe if we got some data out of the south and you extrapolate it out you know the the amount of damage that happens in the sugar industry um would is quite a much larger figure of course there 's issues within the banana industry as well and especially around panama tr4 that 's something that still hasn 't gone away um through you mr chair if i may just on uh dot point one in the recommendation we speak about agribusiness and peak bodies uh cane growers tonight cane grows innisfail cane growers tully abgc cassery coast banana growers in uh association i have been approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acfa and they have asked for consideration that they be included in these conversations or have the ability to look at a co-funded application and probably the sec dot point four um i know we 're just asking the chief executive officer to consider uh the 2022-23 financial year allocation uh to combat feral animals i 'm paraphrasing here we take it back to through the feral pig executive oversight committee i think the future organization that will be formed will be the feral animal executive oversight committee and then that 'll generate more interest from the farm from the grazias and from ag force which again are another essential agribusiness within our region um so mr mayor i don 't know if we can um amend can we amend the resolution mr ceo to include the acfa and maybe change the wording of dot point four to feral animals instead of feral pigs through the through the chair yeah certainly okay so you 're moving that amendment so i 'll move that amendment please that the australian cane farm association be included in dot point one one that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bottom one okay and i mean i 'm sorry thank you council barnes for your indulgence um that committee hasn 't met yet to be formed but that was the intent and the conversation at the last at the last committee meeting of the federal pig executive oversight committee that all federal vertebrates within our region be included which will allow us to do treatment of wild dogs as well and further too [Music] sorry councillor barnes mr sadler already thanked the state government and their investment in this region earlier i would like to personally extend my thanks i was involved in that program for the whole three years it was running three in a bit it was great to have the support that was given to us by the agricultural minister at the time and the department uh people who worked with us right through the entire process were very helpful and i believe they are also going to show interest in being sitting in on this new executive oversight committee as we go forward to provide advice and so thank you mr mayor council millwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconded by councillor barnes uh dot point one have included the australian cane farmers association and dot point four has changed feral peak to feral animal are you comfortable with that amendment i am and i 'd like my questions asked from earlier on too please in regards to the feral pig program do you want to ask that question now before we vote on the amendment yes sorry there was um the mention of the one-off aerial shooting and my question was how is the distribution going to be set out and decided upon and how are farmers eligible mr sadler so through the chair um it 'd be through those key peak bodies for a start so those farmers to liaise with their peak industry body and we 'll work with those peak bodies in relation to what projects uh and how they will do that so again it will be a co-contribution um not just a uh us to the um to the project are you happy with it can i just say that that microphone they 're using is terrible sorry charlie i can 't only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy with that and i just want to reaffirm that we are reallocating ten thousand and there 's also co contributions from the um other peak industry bodies as well is that correct that 's correct council millwood okay thank you well and sorry probably just to just to reiterate that uh councillor millwood that the funds the co-contribution may not necessarily come out of the peak body itself i think the peak body would be the organization who helps put together a proposal for a program um that the most successful efforts in this space are doing clusters and getting farmer getting agribusiness to work together so the individual farmers i 'm suggesting would be the contributors but the the project that will come to council or sorry that 'll come to the executive oversight group will be put together by the peak body group so all the farm all the all the all the agri business people need to speak to their um peak body rep and then those applications will be built so we can do this in a planned and um inclusive manner to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cancelled good thanks mr mayor i 'd like to support this having been landholder years ago and i know the damage of what pigs can do and the biggest pig farmer in our in our area is the national parks and the wet tropics so what we do need we need more government dollars spent and i think this would be money well spent thank you council bones uh any further comments uh we 'll put the amendment to the vote uh council millwood are you voting for the amendment yes i 'm voting in five with the amendment that 's carried unanimously uh that now becomes the substantive motion uh moved by councillor bones seconded by council barnes all in favor council milward yes yes that 's unanimously thank you thank you mr sadler we move on to item 4.6 page 153 operational plan and mr graffon will present this report thank you through the chair the operational plan outlines the activities proposed to be undertaken by council in the 21 22 financial year and these activities contribute to the achievement of the strategies outlined in the corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter review of the 2122 operational plan we have updated the report from previous years and the the status initiatives have been updated to not yet commenced at risk on target not proceeding and complete i will just probably highlight the at-risk items which are highlighted through this report so item number one at risk is undertake the one coast cassery coast survey that that project was earmarked in the operational plan to be undertaken and delivered in quarter two obviously now in quarter three so that is at risk but i 'm pleased to uh to comment that um a consultant has been engaged and we will be working with council and officers next week to finalize questions in relation to that survey number three continue to improve customer satisfaction with all council services there is a target that was put on there for 80 percent satisfaction that 's currently tracking at 77 percent but i do note that uh council have recently adopted a change in structure to our customer experience space we are currently out in the market looking to recruit customer experience manager to to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to see uh some improvement through q3 and q4 with those those changes in place um item number 14 delivery of capital works program uh our capital works program is is always potentially at risk particularly with 14 million dollars worth of carryover projects in there and and our our wet season uh currently upon us so it 's just highlighting that we are dependent on whether to deliver a number of those projects and the last one is number 21 so reduce the amount of waste going into into landfill so council had a target here to reduce waste disposed to in landfill by 200 tonne per quarter with a total of 14 320 tons or less for the financial year so year to date we 're currently 25.73 tons increase compared to the same period last year so council officers will continue the the education that has been ongoing in that space and uh really reiterate to the community that that waste is a really important issue for this community diversion of waste from landfill not only saves costs but is is also best practice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment council do have some challenges in the future in this space with approximately three years of life remaining in our tally landfill so this will continue to be a focus through q2 and srq3 and q4 and we are also working with fnq rock to develop a regional waste strategy that regional waste strategy will hopefully also aid in this space but it is an at-risk item and it is one that will continue to have a heavy focus moving forward thank you mr graf and any questions for the ceo yes through the champ okay council millwood uh it 's it 's just sort of more a comment really on number item 21 in that report from the report our waste to landfill has increased and i urge my fellow councillors to seriously consider the need to invest in a recycling plant such as a mirf which is a material recycling facility in order to reduce waste from going to landfill or support such things like the prospect of um sending our waste via rail to marieba rather than the current use of road transport so i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around you know how we can stop this happening but yeah anyway thank you thank you councillor millwood the ceo of noted your comments about going forward with that policy uh council chewing oh just quickly um yeah it 's just it 's not disappointing i mean it 's it 's part of life i suppose but landfill is obviously a big issue i 've noticed i 've got building work in my street and there 's a lot of waste from that so with the increased building and of our area i 'm wondering i 'm guessing that that would be adding considerably to our increase in the landfill yeah and through through the chair i guess uh the the easiest mechanism to uh try and change behavior is is through pocket and i guess there 's an opportunity for council in the upcoming budget to uh to review those fees and charges and try and incentivize um construction industry and even residents within the region to to focus more on on recycling and diverting that waste from landfill thank you council chewy any further questions comments somebody move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by councillor dewey all in favour it 's carried unanimously thank you uh we move on to item 4.7 page 169 council of remuneration 2022 2023 and mr graffon will present this report thank you mayor through the chair the local government remuneration commission is an independent entity that 's established under the local government act uh the commission has uh decided to increase the maximum remuneration levels for mayors deputy mayors and councillors by two percent from one july 2022 in making that determination the they have listed a number of things that they have reviewed to to inform that including increases in consumer price index increases to the wage price index average weekly earnings for the periods queensland weekly payroll jobs and wages along with another a number of other items the under the act the commission establishes also establishes the categories of local governments and decides the category to which each local government belongs so the commission has considered the kasseri coast regional council as a category three local government so other category three local governments include gimpy isaac lockheed valley noosa south burnett the tablelands regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three local governments including cassery coast regional council are detailed in the report and have the effect of that two percent increase the report has a recommendation there and officers are recommending that council resolves to adopt the remuneration schedule as determined by the local government remuneration and discipline tribunal in accordance with section 244 of the local government regulation 2012 from 1 july 2022 thank you mr graffen any questions for the officer if not do we have a mover please move by councillor pervin seconded by councillor barnes fall in favor councillor milward yes yes in favour that 's carried unanimously thank you thank you mr graffen uh we now move on to item five asset sustainability 5.1 page 194 the capital report and mr fisher will present thank you mr chair welcome good morning councillors morning mr fisher council this is our monthly update uh for the capital works program uh we 've got 262 projects uh this financial year totaling a value of 49.7 million dollars as at the 4th of february we 'd expended 28.1 million which equates to approximately 50 57 of the deliverable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with uh the red lights against them just to to flag them the town centres uh that 's related to the mission beach uh car park uh and that 's i guess the result of that initial uh budget estimate uh being undertaken before we had that final design uh the project 's tracked well we 've made some decisions in the way we delivered that work and in the payment design which will help reduce the cost of that project but comes back to that initial budget as as you know there 's the the bigger cbd master plan project uh and the intention is to seek support from council to uh to reallocate some funding towards the initial stage being the car park uh obviously the the wayfinding signage um i guess that that project uh the nature of that work led to some uh changes in scope which which saw that one um also go slightly over budget so uh in in general council uh last month was very wet as you 'd all appreciate uh there was still some works which were finished um a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the plan for some time following the sea wall works uh and the mission beach um stinging that drainage again a long-standing issue around that that toilet block near castaways and the teams there have delivered a cost-effective solution for that that work uh just to note in the final table uh on page 197 through the regional road group uh we 've picked up some additional tids funding there for a number of culvert renewal projects that we have access to some of that funding this financial year and some next financial year so effectively a good outcome towards the tail end of the year in terms of picking up some additional funding and i guess because of uh some forward planning and design work that had been done uh we 've been able to um i guess capture that funding and and deliver it which uh you know saves our rate pays 50 of those project costs are a good outcome uh happy to take any questions uh relating to this through the chair thank you mr fisher councillor pervert yeah thank you mr fischer a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being over budget um what area where we have a budget there they 're still not even operational properly yet uh sorry uh yeah i guess the original budget for that that project was uh put together before the the tenders went out uh councillor pervin and um obviously with the i guess around the time that that went out uh we were on the onset of covered so there 's some material costs and also just the nature of that work being on the state controlled road corridor the complexities of delivering it with covid um led to some changes um and happy to you know take that one on notice and bring back some more information to council if you 're yeah if you could please i 'd just like to know when they will be completed because the signage still isn 't working the lights aren 't working on so many of them um be good to have that information because the general public 's still asking when will they be completed but i 'll leave that one go if you could get back to us but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sorry through the tear just an update on that so that the signs are installed um there have been some defects in that process we did get an update on uh tuesday that uh the contractor arm signs indicated they 'd be attending to the defects to the science this week he indicated he was waiting for the manufacturing of a new component for the south innisfail sign so that 's the one where there is a more major defect with the lighting which is attending to as well but some of the other issues are to do with vegetation so we have shared some photos with councillors this week of vegetation management that 's currently being undertaken um noting that uh solar panels don 't uh don 't work that effectively if they 're um not um subjected to solar thanks mr cea um yes mr fisher miguel in the capital project there we talked about mcgowan drivers being deferred could you give us a reasoning why the deferral on that one yeah through the chair um councillor pervin when we uh attended that work uh it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our our budget and we didn 't uh i guess that also meant we didn 't have any contingency or any other type of provision going into to manage and deliver that project uh what the team have have done is uh we 're looking at the pavement design on that project to look for opportunities to reduce that scope of works in terms of of the pavement renewal we 're also looking at opportunities one of the long council 's pathway implementation plan uh has a path on the on the riverside of mcgowan drive so we 're just looking i guess at the you know taking this as an opportunity to re-look at that design work out how we can potentially reduce the cost of that work also to be able to provide council with an estimate on the on that pathway works should it choose to consider that in its upcoming budget or a future budget so the intention is to revise that scope of works and then talk with council in the upcoming budget about where we think the latest estimate for that scope of works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into next year we 've got adequate budget and an appropriate scope there 's also consideration being given again nothing nothing formalised yet but as other projects in the in the works are owen street and potentially bulking those you know combining those projects together to create a relatively large um you know num piece of work within the innisfail cbd so that that can be coordinated and potentially managed as one one contract thanks mr fischer just got one more the in the report there it talks about the mission beach waste transfer facility um how are we going there is it on track and on budget yeah through the chair uh council bourbon that that project we 've found uh that many many years ago people illegally uh placed some waste under that site without permit and um and that 's been discovered now that we 're there working uh what when we undertook that investigation for that project uh council didn 't have knowledge of it being used previously as a landfill as it as it doesn 't have approval for uh landfill only a transfer station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there 's a large quantity of uh waste that 's been dumped there um likely probably back uh many cyclones ago um and and so are now in the process of removing that waste and disposing of it in a legal way through our uh our landfills uh so that 's that 's led to a i guess a significant uh increase in cost than expected i would like to point out though that you know that waste has to be removed irrespective of of whether we knew about it or not um team us expecting that there 's probably an order of around two hundred thousand dollars worth of additional work there uh largely a lot of that is in the tip fees to dispose of it so that 's um obviously coming coming back in in some form but yes a significant increase in cost and obviously wet weather uh and the types of works that are being undertaken in terms of earthworks there is delaying the project but the the the team are back working on site and um you know expect that to be you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of delay thank you council bergen any questions councillor chewie thank you mr mr fisher through the chair just regarding an update please on the south mission beach path i know its first part i believe is is complete and the playground is back and the community are very very happy about that but i 'm just wondering about an update on stage two and how that 's progressing thank you yeah thank you councillor chewie through the chair uh stage two we 're currently working with with tmr about our options to deliver that work obviously uh that that project has 50 funding from the state um and i guess we when we 're looking at that stage too there are a number of options being considered in terms of whether we uh follow the road and and keep it next to the road or potentially divert back around some houses between the caravan park and and rejoin the path um up more towards the the transfer station uh the intention uh is to bring a council uh report to the march meeting uh just to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be considered uh and uh i i guess we are just working through with tmr the i guess the options around where we locate that in terms of the road as it 's a state controlled road corridor tmr need to approve that design they 've given us in principle approval for that for that root along the front but obviously once we get into detail we 're looking at language and drainage and a few things that we need to seek clarification on what they would allow we 're expecting that we 've got some of that advice expecting more from them in the coming weeks and then also the the funding side of things which is managed through a different department within tmr getting some advice to them around time frames and and cost and scope so um yeah bringing a report to the march meeting to seek some direction there from council thank you thank you council council mclaren thank you through the chair i was just wondering if we could possibly put um something through our comms team regarding the wayfinding signs just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone calls regarding that if we could just put something out to the public at where we 're at with that would be greatly appreciated please through the chair yeah certainly that 's been noted by the ceo any further questions for mr fisher yes through the chair okay council millwood yeah um through the chair mr fisher i just um wanted to touch base on the talia the parking reseal has the line marking or the signage gotten any closer uh through the chair councillor millwood uh at our uh recent coordination meeting on wednesday um the the team looking after that project and and there 's a number of other projects in cardwell and mission beach car park um informed me that the line marking crew is booked in for the next within the next fortnight so that that that work will be done uh i did we didn 't discuss the issue of the signage so i 'll take that one on notice and provide you with an update thank you councilman any further questions for mr fisher somebody move the recommendation please move by councillor chewie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor okay that 's unanimous thank you uh we move on to item 5.2 page 207 renaming of a gazetted road and mr acatino will present morning good good morning all morning um so the report in front of you we um we have received a um request from uh mr arthur rogers who resides on rogers road in east palmerston to correct the spelling of a road from rogers road spot with the g uh d d g to without it without the d so um the history here is that rogers road was one of three roads in the east palmerston area that were named in honor of world war ii servicemen the other two roads being pullham road and dunn road we have a in the attachment on the report there is a map of east palmerston highlighting these ownerships from 1942 so what 's happened is that there are inconsistencies with respect to the spelling of rogers road which can be found between title registry records council records and road signage so a correction of this name of the road by council resolution will facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title records this will prevent further confusion with respect to the correct naming and spelling of the road so the recommendation is that council officially renames rogers road to rogers road without this without the dna thank you mr catino any questions or comments counsellors counselor bones just as a comment and probably with my rsl hat on a lot of the times in these sort of works sometimes there 's slight misspellings i know that there is a cenotaph um up at the east palmerston hall that the rsl funded some work and it was a simple mistake around um the misspelling of a rank but i mean those sort of things are very important and i 'd uh commend the staff on um getting having this request come in and taking it seriously um it 's very important you know we 've got we 've got people who 've served in our defence forces in this country and um they all be recognized appropriately so i would move the recommendation mr mayor i moved by councilman seconded by councillor mccloud uh the changing of the street signage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of line with the center which was very disrespectful uh cancer chewie thank you like i support everything i just wanted to add too that a lot of people do family ancestry so when they 're looking up names and things to go back it 's really important that the correct spelling is there so i think this is great that it 's been recognised thank you uh councilor pervin yeah i 'd just like to acknowledge and thank the staff for this because i know the residents of east palmerston have been wanting this to hap wanting this to happen for some time and i think it 's going to be very very good for me to get to these palmerston hall tomorrow night for my monthly dinner and be able to say this has finally happened from yeah well said any further questions or comments if not somebody it 's been moved by council bone second by council macleod all in favor councillor millwood yes in favour that 's carried unanimously thank you we move on to item 5.3 page 210 asset rationalization process mr acatino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report on the asset rationalization process so this is um as a date as of the end of quarter two um so as a the end of quarter two we have achieved a saving of 165 000 in annual depreciation and operation expenses so as you can see in the report there is still a lot to go but we are working hard to recognize all these estimated savings i just wanted to highlight that um like through this through this process it isn 't all just about um you know removing assets it 's about rationalizing them so it could be about setting up leases and and changing financial recognition of our assets and stuff so it 's not just about removing assets it 's about better utilizing the assets that we 've got um and this is sort of reflected in that um the estimated savings the break up there where you can see our approach is almost 50 percent is about leasing and setting up leases and user agreements um that 's uh the graph there on page 212 of the report um and um yeah so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's about better utilizing the ones we 've got and and making sure that the end users are paying for what what what is out there just some highlights um so we have sold a couple of um three houses so there 's a former caretaker houses that piece at pease park and the tully show grounds and the council employee housing at stoddas hill have all been sold at auction we have got some auctions um that will be coming up soon to re-auction some of the ones that didn 't go in the last round and we have got a number of user agreements that um are with the clubs to um progress so there is still a lot in the works and we are progressing them as they 're coming along um yeah through the chair if there 's any questions thank you mr catino any questions for the officer okay somebody move the recommendation please moved by councillor barnes seconded by councillor baines all in favor council milwaukee yes yes and unanimously thank you thank you mr acatino we move on to item 5.4 page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will present this report morning welcome good morning uh this report considers a request to renew the lease at 2 4 lilly street innisfail with consideration of section 236b2 of the local government regulation uh the innersvales senior citizens center was established in 1988 and have occupied the site since 1990. they built the current hall and facilities which are in a very good state of repair and uh they 've been looking that uh after that ever since um just as uh further background i guess some of the key um activities that uh that the club uh are involved in include cards bocce bowls craft pilates dancing and yoga they perform a valuable community service to elderly residents of the region by helping them remain active and socially connected at present they have a strong membership of some 144 members who regularly participate in these activities and also hire out the hall to other organizations um the lease expired on the 3rd of march 2020 and they have subsequently requested a new 30-year lease the central terms of the proposed new lease include uh the premises which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 years from the first of the first 2022 to 31st of the 12th 2051 it would be a peppercorn lease arrangement and the lease is responsible for all rates charges and outgoings with the permitted use of senior citizens center as part of the um as part of the consideration officers have done a review with um uh the board of the senior citizens club and looked at the governance insurance and assess the uh the application in line with council 's adopted principles and are pleased to [Music] please to note that uh uh the club is a really good sustainable organization with a demonstrated track record and uh and we 're happy to recommend the uh the extension of their lease on site there thank you mr mcbride any questions for the officer no i 'll move that move by council millwood seconded by councillor pervin all in favor carried unanimously thank you we move on to item 5.5 page 225 asset rationalization the igloo mr mcbride thank you man this report considers a proposal from the tully igloo preservation group tipg to enter into a user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with council 's adopted principles to make an unbiased recommendation on the future of the tully egyu tully igloo and amenities block just by way of background it 's probably worth noting some of the consider council resolutions that have led to this paper today and i 'll just touch on those very quickly on the 10th of december 2020 uh cc ccrc adopted the principles for use of council facilities uh 22nd of july 2021 there was a resolution to dispose of the tully igloo subject to tully mission beach pickleball being able to demonstrate the ongoing sustainable use of the facility on the 28th of october 2021 council noted a submission was received from the community for ongoing use of the tully igloo the submission was to be reviewed by council officers with a recommendation to be deferred back to council on the 29th and 1st of november officers met with tully igloo preservation group to discuss the proposal that had been submitted and provide feedback with consideration to council 's adoptive principles on the 15th of november a final proposal was received from the taliban preservation group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission that was presented by tully preservation group was presented to the councils via a community sorry a council information session in december so the report considers a number of things in relation to the submission from the tully igloo preservation group and i 'll just run through these dot by dot first of all we just wanted to note the annual holding cost of the tully igloo it 's estimated at around seventy thousand four hundred and forty five dollars and these uh these costs include insurance operation and maintenance annual depreciation and management the condition of the building a building inspection was carried out on the 4th of october and noted the following key points no structural issues were ident identified on the day however it was recommended a structural engineer inspect prior to entering into any long-term uh tenure arrangement uh to provide further comment on roofing and other key components external painting uh the igloo and associated amenities block the painting is probably presenting i would say quite tired and is dated and would be at a time if it was to be retained that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stadium lights that are out inside the stadium and a review of the major electrical components uh the submission from the tully preservation group provided council with its progress made since the initial submission on 18th of october 2021 it reflected the engagement within the community to propose the following sliding scale of fees for councils consideration these fees started at 8 300 in year one and uh increased incrementally until year five which would reflect a fee of fourteen thousand three hundred ninety five dollars uh and also just worth noting that the proposal requested council continue to manage the facility and bookings uh this reflects a net a net short for to council of fifty five thousand dollars to sixty two thousand dollars per annum uh a total subsidy from rate payers over a five year period would be in the vicinity of two hundred ninety three thousand dollars in uh sorry two hundred and ninety three thousand dollars uh excluding capital and renewal costs the assessment based on ccrc 's adoptive principles broke down the principles into four categories which was governance sustainability community and economic benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh council would not typically enter into any formal arrangement with a group that is not incorporated community groups are generally required to demonstrate that they have a strong track record of governance and compliance this includes um provision of or review of trading records financial statements agm minutes and organizational rules and constitution uh however officers did note that the talib preservation group have outlined a plan to deliver this but were unable to deliver it at this point in time sustainability the proposal from telugu preservation group operates at a significant uh would operate at a significant deficit to continue to deliver these services at the facility in line with the proposal would require an operational subsidy of 293 000 over five years plus any capital renewal costs uh the report also noted that uh the igloo was not deemed critical for the delivery of these activities as there are a number of alternate venues available around the community and region in relation to community and economic benefit ccrc acknowledged that the tully igloo preservation group has done a great job engaging with the community to establish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was again noted that these activities are not activities are able to be delivered to the community in surrounding venues and spaces some of these include but are not limited to the mpc the pavilions at the showgrounds the tully grandstand community halls and cyclone shelter and in terms of utilization prior to prior to the current use by pickleball the igloo was mainly used by the tully nipple with limited use by other groups and whilst the tully igloo preservation group have identified a number of users for the facility it should be noted that construction of new facilities can deliver these services as identified above based on the above assessment there were two options uh i guess to be considered by council and number one is the recommendation that 's been presented today and this includes that council note the significant work done by the tully igloo preservation group to engage with the community to deliver services at the igloo two request offices work with affected community groups as highlighted in this report to recommend alternate facilities by 30th june 2022 three proceed with the asset rationalization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amenities block as resolved at council meeting lg 1058 for request a ceo provide budget consideration in the 2022-2023 budget for the disposal of the igloo and the attached amenities block and five allocate a budget in the financial year 2022 2023 to engage with relevant community groups to develop a new master plan for the tully show grounds to be adopted by council the second option in line with the submission from taliga preservation group [Music] refer to the following and one council note the holding cost of the facility an ongoing subsidy by rate payers of an asset that has been identified as surplus to the community needs two acknowledge this approach is inconsistent with council 's adopted principles expectations and responsibilities three authorise the ceo to negotiate the final terms and conditions of a user agreement with the tully igloo preservation group for a term up to five years as identified in their submission four authorise the ceo to give budget consideration for the initial capital renewal works including painting lighting carry out electoral electrical and structural uh compliance checks in the next financial year budget and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the fixed term of the agreement in line with ccrc 's adopted asset disposal policy council officers have recommended that option one is adopted by council [Music] based on an assessment in line with council 's adopted principles and i guess um noting that uh in addition to council 's adoptive principles noting that uh the report from the asset engineer that 's previously presented to council that the uh the main drivers behind this uh the cassowary coast regional council 's asset to population ratio is high and contributes to higher rates for the community and uh it 's also worth noting that holding cost of our asset base is likely to become more challenging with high inflation forecasts thank you mr mcbride through the chair yeah councilwood through the chair um i 'd like to present the following amendment for consideration um number one note the submissions from the interested community groups and tully igloo preservation group number two acknowledge that the current use of the tully igloo does not meet council 's adopted community use of asset principles expectations and responsibilities and three resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed for the tully show grounds in consultation with the community and users number four request the chief chief executive officer provide a budget consideration for the master plan in the 2223 financial year and number five authorize the ceo to negotiate the terms of the user agreement for the facility thank you council millwood do you have a secondary but there 's a few words i 'd just like to place in that recommendation just hang on um i know we 've got an amendment there uh councillor miller do you want to speak to your amendment now we 've got a seconder yes i would like to speak to it so in line of sight i 'm a born and bred local with and would like to share some of the history of this iconic community asset the igloo once stood on the car park directly across from the tully council chambers it was then relocated some years later to the tully show grounds where it sits today this building has been utilized over the years by many groups and for many different purposes and some of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weddings and the likes of many more community functions with the right management in place and the agreement from users to adopt the principles of council in my opinion there is no reason this very important community asset couldn 't reach its full potential and serve as an active community hub we have seen over the past days the ongoing support to keep this iconic building from the tully community and ask for your consideration i ask you to consider my amendment and ask you to listen to our community when making this very important decision the community believes the usage has grown and that they have indication from many other groups who wish to use this facility i have challenged the recommendations and i look for your support in retaining this very important community asset thank you council milward now over to the second day to speak oh good thank you very much um just to elaborate more on the previous speaker a little bit of history and i hope i 'm not repeating that building was firstly purchased by cardwell shy council in 1940 and was placed across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the council workshop uh in 1968 we as a council purchased the anderson street depot where a major depot is today and igloo came vacant and something that tully does so well the locals rally so it was local churches service clubs and sporting clubs put effort into the then building and turned it in to a sports stadium with the help of lions rotary apex and various many sporting groups in 1980 it outgrew the town and the then cardwell shy council shifted it to the showgrounds they then lifted the roof to make it an all all indoor sports stadium and it was named the jp burn sports stadium after tip burns who was a local councillor for over 30 years and as i said earlier it served many balls etc etc so further on from that firstly where we 're sitting today this rationalization process we 're currently in it 's it 's not all bad many clubs have benefited by it by lengthy leases and they know that their future is secured for many years to come in 2020 tully support center wanted to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hiring to users but never received a response the igloo was given a clean bill of health by an engineer only recently and the local council electrician gary leong said except for a few lights the electrics are perfect in my view removing the largest indoor sports centre in the wettest town in australia is utterly ridiculous council is a community service supplier sporting events libraries and swimming pools these are all community assets it will cost more to demolish the igloo than to maintain it for the next 10 years insurance should be on the current value not the replacement value as far as depreciation goes which i 'm always harping on about we need to submit a case to the queensland government as the igloo fits the bill as was done with the perry harvey jetty at mission beach and it was successful and is enjoyed by many people every day i just hope that common sense prevails thank you council barnes uh speakers for and against uh councillor baines oh you 're doing four no no whatever your first council bones all right thank you mister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all this work and i 'd also like to commend all the community organisations that have gone into the process over our entire region and have worked with the officers as well i i understand the history and and you know it 's a beautiful building uh i know there 's a military a link to it which is is one of the things that uh quite attracts me uh to the building um councilor millwood you mentioned a great piece in there about the community members getting involved and working in the future towards uh the same resolutions as other clubs and and service associations uh within our region have gone to and and i think that 's that 's the greatest part of this piece um councillor barnes i 'm sorry but insurance and replacement value i don 't think that 's anything we can step away from and i 'm sorry accrual accounting and the way the state government make us deal with that is another thing regardless of peter and paul 's opinion that that we can 't step away from um back to councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this but but the people who want to get involved and get encouraged to use it um you know everyone 's got to fuss in and do a bit of work towards it i go to a local service club we all put in five dollars at the start and that helps run the service club and keep keep it going probably an unfortunate analogy but you know i paid 8.50 for a beer at a pub the other day you know so a small contribution by many members ends up becoming over the 12-month period can be a significant amount of money to help lessen the burden on the other ratepayers so i 'm support i am thank you councillor i 'm supportive of the amendments i would like to see some master planning done but i would i would also and i 'm going to support you e councillor millwood in encouraging the community members and the users to come forward negotiate with our council officers and let 's get a resolution that doesn 't burden the other ratepayers of the region as all the other groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair yes i too would like to support the amendment i just have a couple of comments like councillor millwood i have very very many fond memories of the talley igloo in both locations uh just a couple of points i would like to raise um and i admire i just like to take my hat off to the group that have stood up and worked hard to raise this awareness of the the situation within the community but my question is about the broader community um have the group and have we as a council engaged with the youth because if we agree to save this building do the rate payers in 25 years time still want to have ownership of it so they possibly they do i don 't know i can 't answer that but i just think it 's something that we need to consider we have personal attachment to it but my question would be do the next generation have the same passion secondly i would just wondering as this is such a historical uh piece as both councillor barnes and millwood have raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of historical society in tully i know that our local library in tully does a fantastic job of recording history but we have a very strong uh passion for history mission beach alaris cardwell and innisfail all have groups that record their history they meet monthly um and and then they meet as a collective group uh i think every three months to share stories so there might be another opportunity for groups uh another group to come on board to to work towards saving uh and and uh preserving the history of that that building and any other buildings that are of historical significance in our area thank you i just have a question for mr mcbride if i may um mr mcbride i have been phoned a couple of times uh with this uh situation and the the common thread of conversation was that they 've they felt that there was lack of consultation with from council and yourself in following up um different procedures and uh and questions that this these groups might have had i just want to if you could like to comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this uh process with the igloo has been going on for some time and uh it goes back to uh to sort of april june last year but uh even back in 30th june 2021 council hosted a public consultation session at the tully grandstand where we had up to 50 attendees attend that meeting and certainly the sentiment of the community has not been lost uh i guess when we 're making our assessments we look at the portfolio at a higher level and look at the challenges through that but with the submission that came back after that meeting at the grandstand we received that submission on the 18th of october and noted that it needed some additional work in terms of being assessed against council uh council 's adopted principles um and subsequently we met with the taligay preservation group on the 25th of october and 21st of october sorry on the 25th of october 28th of october a big apartment sorry i 'm just reading my notes here yeah so sorry on the 29th of october we met with the telugu preservation group and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final proposal to council which was then received on the 5th of november so throughout the process from june to july when we got that final version of the submission from tully that was a really honest assessment and um was something that we could present to councillors for consideration um so we certainly helped them get to that final version which has then been workshop with council since but that was the um i guess the final product which uh which was there for consideration and uh and that 's what was discussed today thank you mr mcbride any further speakers for against yeah thanks through the chair um yes councillor millard i 'd like to support you in your uh mended recommendation for this and i think the glue shall remain in my opinion i think there 's a lot of user groups there you know the emails coming through the phone calls just having a look at the building a few months ago and again today just it 's a magnificent build it looks beautiful i don 't want to see it go thank you council bourbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that amended motion but i don 't think i 'll go ahead with it and get rather messy but if this does get through the officers may take a few little words on notice that the word it says like in dot three tally igloo i 'd like to see like a period of years put after that put a time factor in there because it may be sped up with not enough consultation and right at the end it says a user agreement what i 'd like to see the word affordable user agreement but mr mayor i 'm not going to push that through it 'll get too messy uh if this gets through today i 'm sure that our staff are great enough to take that on board thank you it 's very well said thank you through the chair we will certainly take that on on notice in any negotiations and um to council chewie 's point um if we do progress with a master plan we 're happy to bring back a community engagement plan to council uh to ensure that we have captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving forward does uh effectively consult with the community and and ensure that those user groups are heard um in defense of the the deputy mayor i did want to um just highlight that the total depreciation over the life of the igloo is is 1.18 million dollars so uh the current uh depreciation currently totals 1.032 million dollars with an annual figure of 33 000 so it will be fully depreciated by 2026 and when the igloo is fully depreciated the asset will continue to be recognized on the balance sheet as a fixed asset at cost but will be fully offset by the accumulated depreciation so once fully depreciated no further depreciation will be recognized against the asset thank you screwed the chair through the chair i just wanted to also um say that with the consideration of the master plan that the master plan actually does involve the wider community consultation so like people will have a chance to come forward and express their views through the chair yet certainly will um will bring the community engagement plan back to council to ensure that council is satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community council mclaren sorry thank you through the chair yeah i just wanted to support councillor millwood in that um amendment thank you okay councilman we haven 't got a copy of your amendment can you repeat your amendment please yes i can i would like to put the present present the following amendment for consideration number one note the submissions from the interested community groups and the tally igloo preservation group number two acknowledge that the current use of the tully igloo does not meet cancel adopted community use of asset principles expectations and responsibilities number three resolve to retain the tally igloo whilst a master plan is developed for the tully show grounds in consultation with the community and users number four request the chief executive officer provide a budget consideration for the master plan in the 2022-2023 financial year and five authorized the chief executive officer to negotiate the terms of a user agreement for the facility thank you council millwood i 'll put the amendment to the vote all in favor you 're obviously voting in favour council milward i am voting in five yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion and i 'll put the substantive motion to the vote all in favor that 's carried unanimously thank you we move on thank you mr mcbride we now move on to item six planning services uh and before we do asked mr jones to speak on the first item um you 'll note in this agenda there 's a record number of applications for uh infrastructure charges reduction and i just want to give a bit of background to why the policy was introduced by mayor shannon at a 50 percent reduction and updated by mayor cromastis to 100 which it is currently today and fully supported by this council regional development has outcomes which are felt across the entire community investments in our towns will strengthen our local economy and ensure future growth opportunities while ensuring castro coast residents can stay in their home towns and have employment opportunities increased development drives economic growth brings more tourists improves the connection between people employment services and goods money is not changing hands here council is foregoing income for infrastructure that is already in the ground for the long term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself since 2014 the projects which have been completed underway or waiting construction start have contributed over 43 million in direct construction costs to the local economy with only a reduction in about 2.65 million dollars in infrastructure charges these figures do not include the ongoing economic benefits and social benefits through new residents moving to the area expenditure in the local economy and new services and businesses opening up given these potential benefits and the economic gains possible we no longer need to be asking is it worth it instead we should be asking if we are prepared to miss such an opportunity to grow and future proof our towns and support our local construction industry with those few words and a bit of background i 'll hand over to mr jones item 6.1 page 231 good morning everybody good morning through the chair councillors and received a request from mewing planning consultants on behalf of mr raymond francis graffiti for 100 reduction of infrastructure charges the application was approved by council by delegated authority subject to conditions on the 27th of january 2022 100 reduction in the infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 discount with the revised infrastructure charge amount being zero dollars proposed development complies the eligibility criteria and therefore is recommended that a request for 100 reduction in infrastructure charges be approved by council provided that all works associated with the development as contained within the reconfiguration of a lot of approval and any other statutory requirements are completed prior to

um look i see we 've got a fair few of these on our agenda um i won 't comment on every single one of them but they 're all relatively much the same like i said they 're all within our prioritized infrastructure areas but having a look outside that you 've got a shortage of housing in all regions on the cast very coast so not just uh one allotment of land you 're building two properties on the one council will gain double the rates we have the services are there anyway you 'd have a whether you have a two-bedroom uh four-bedroom home with two bathrooms you can have two-bedroom duplex with two bathrooms anyway so it 's all there but the biggest thing is you 're gonna open up a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in homes so i dare say they 'll be moving into a newer home and the previous existing home will be available for tenants that are desperately crying out in our region um and like i said once before it 's just the the generation of extra revenue for our rates from these properties is you know i applaud the previous council and the council before that for in introducing these waves not waivers but the infrastructure charges i think it 's a great idea and we 've got developers coming to our town who wish to develop in this region because of what we have in place mr mayor i know you quoted the other day about down south said they wish they could do it but they don 't no that 's right but yeah i 'm happy to move this one as well by council permanent secondary boy council mclaren are there any further speakers yeah i 'd just like to also um make a comment on that like this will really help with the lack of housing in the area and also the economic activation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its weight and gold than the money that we have let go in charges so i i really welcome this to the community thank you council milward uh with those few comments all in favor council milwaukee yeah yep carrick unanimously thank you item 6.4 page 258 application reduction infrastructure charges mr jones thank you mr mayor uh council the next three reports are very similar so i 'll try and summarise them as best i can so um basically it 's the same consultant so it 's the same planning consultant and the same uh applicant and the charges are exactly the same so the waiver would be twenty nine thousand three hundred and thirty nine dollars and fifty five cent discount um prior to completion in jan and the 27th of january um council say uh obviously they 're for a duplex and yeah a lot to back up what uh councillor perman said before it 's good to see this this type of development happening in the region and opening up those houses and we know we 're in a bit of a rental crisis at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help so uh council i 'm happy to answer the any questions on these three okay any questions for our counselor mains no no no any questions counselor milward no okay uh somebody move item 6.5 we 'll do them one at a time moved by councilman seconded by council

of use of multiple dwellings being three units the application was approved by council on the 9th of december 2021. 100 reduction in infrastructure charges would for the development would result in a twelve thousand dollar five twelve thousand five hundred and seventy four dollar and five cent discount proposed development complies the eligibility criteria and therefore is recommended that a

councillor barnes all in favor council millwood yeah it 's gary unanimously thank you okay we move on to item 6.8 application production infrastructure charges mr jones thank you mr mayor and this will be my last one council so you don 't have to listen to me anymore today so council has received a request from mr christopher colair for 100 reduction of the infrastructure charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two lots the application was approved by council by delegated authority on the 7th 7th of february 2022. dallin has demonstrated that it generally complies with the eligibility criteria of the policy due to the site not being serviced by chancellor 's trunk infrastruct infrastructure serious network however with the proposed development is for the creation of an additional residential allotment where a future dwelling house will be required to construct an on-site septic system therefore the connection to council 's trump sewerage infrastructure network is not required to facilitate the development 100 reduction in the infrastructure charges for the development would result in a 17 603.73 discount the price development generally complies the eligibility and assessment criteria and therefore is recommended that a request for 100 reduction in infrastructure charges be approved by council try that all works associated with the development as contained within the reconfiguration of lot approval and any other statutory requirements are completed prior to the 7th of february 2025. happy to answer any questions counseling thank you accounts uh mr jones councillor months ah good thank you mr may this is residential and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um barnes it is rural residential land so rural residential are we making the blocks too small for that category uh through the chair this this particular subdivision will result in a block which is 5 000 square meters which has an existing house and the block next door will be three and a half thousand square meters thank you okay any questions for mr jones on that one do we have a mover a counsellor barnes and councillor mccloud all in favor let 's carry unanimously thank you uh can i also say that i 'll cancel perven hi cancer bones mr mayor and that 's probably not a point of order but i just wanted to make sure that we captured 6.4 and we did a vote on it so i 'm not sure if it was moved and seconded i 'm just just a reiteration point for myself if we skip over it we 've got to capture that 6.4 yeah we 've got to move in a second yeah we 've got all that that 's all right just making sure thanks for that um can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that the original decision was made was this council had a major problem with land banking we had a lot of approvals that were lapsing and bill shannon in his wisdom felt that the incentive scheme might get projects across the line uh and i think the proof 's in the pudding today that the policy is definitely working so the basis of why it was brought in was to address land banking which uh mr horton presented to us back in the day it was a major problem uh we were seen as an anti-development council because we wouldn 't get things up we were approving them commercial reality kicked in and people weren 't doing them so this policy is helping we now move on to item 6.9 page 303 uh the crown hotel request for extended trading hours mr horton will present thanks mr mayor sorry i don 't have as many as boron had so thank god but um good morning to all and i hope he 's all well um i look forward this is a request to extending trading hours i hope council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've received correspondence after a meeting with the owner of the crown hotel discuss and reconsider a past response provided to the office of liquor and gaming the owner had requested a review of the trading hours of liquor and establishment from the current 10 a.m to 2 a.m wednesday to saturday and 10 a.m to 12 a.m sunday to tuesday two or seven day trade at the same hours of set 10 a.m to 2 a.m monday to sunday the recommendation is there council the council offer no objection to the granting and additional hours from that 12 a.m to 2 a.m sunday to tuesday six additional hours it is council to allow the trade of liquor from the crown hotel in us file from 10 a.m to 2 a.m monday to sunday based on the additional information that was provided enlisted to council about the multi-million dollar repurchase in the entire premises which has changed the amenity quite in good order of that locality um so council i 'm happy to answer any questions on this or um follow through on any other stuff but as we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tab and liquor barnet the the rear of that property has been carried out more on-site parking has been provided entrances to the building be redone and the whole building 's been refurnished so i 'll hand over to the mayor and council thank you mr horton i 'll actually move the recommendation do we have a seconder councillor pervin uh are there any speakers any questions from mr horton i think i 'll just cancel just briefly um from thanks mr horton for your report just on briefly on that the liquor licensing everybody else is on board with us so as a council i can 't see why we can 't get behind and support them like mr horton said they 've invested a lot of money the place is very appealing very tidy now um in reality they 're asking for six additional hours early in the weekend on the sunday evening there 's not a lot of difference in their trading operation areas really but to have the other departments happy with this i think we should be on board as a council supporting them thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to move in a second all in favor councillor milward yes that 's yours thank you very much thank you mr horton uh that brings us to item seven general business any general business items counsellors yes i 've got a few bits here all right you can go first councilman thank you um first of all i 'd just like to reiterate that we have our community survey which we will be available very shortly and i 'd my advice is for you to all take the time to fill it out because this is the chance for you to have your say and the feedback will be extremely important for future decision making we also have on the first sunday in march which is the 6th of march is the official cleanup australia day you can register online at www.cleanup.org.au if you 're interested um and i also have a brief update on the bells creek transfer station for those that have been quite interested in this um the medal including push bites etc has been is being moved tomorrow if it hasn 't already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we speak the mulches should be there now drum master will be cleared this week fires have been taken to tully for collection mems have been notified of the fertilizer bags and the degasser will be there to decast the fridges and freeze freezers and then they will also be removed so yeah that 's me thanks thank you councillor milward councillor chewie thank you through the through the chair um just for mr jones or mr horton um if i may uh with the master plan we um assume we 'll be going ahead i 've just had various uh residents concerned uh call me with concerns about all abilities access to different places i 'm just wondering if we have i 'm assuming we have but if you could give some explanation on disability access all ability access that might be moving forward with the master plan thank you yeah council um thanks councillor for that question look i 'm moving forward with that project we will head into detailed design as we go through that we 'll look at all those accesses and entrance and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right through to the front um into those existing streets we 've got david street you know the main village green area so under under the relevant acts that we need to deal with we need to make sure that we 're doing that when we comply with those components um it will be incorporated in and we 'll definitely make sure that we consult through our consultation period with those groups we 're currently finalizing those aspects and when we do we 'll go to those stakeholders and make sure that everyone 's considered and you know agreeable to what we do council veins thank you sorry if i may head further to that mr horton um uh the council offices i think it was well it was nikita purini at the time i think is it we spent a whole day down there with the disability advisory group and did a full tour and so there was quite a document put together at the time and i 'm sure the planners will be able to have a look at that and if there 's been any other ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers take that sort of uh differently abled access very seriously in all their planning so thank you councillor um just for mr sadler please thank you mr sadler um i 've just had people contact me regarding the service levels in the different areas of the kasuri coast regarding lawn mowing and things like that there has been a conversation about different numbers in different areas and perhaps the work not being done to some you know as as required obviously we 've been affected by covert and the intermittent rain has made the grasses grow like crazy but if you could just see some clarification on numbers of who is where and what they actually set out to do and can those groups then be moved should they be required to go to different areas thank you drew the chair thanks councillor chewie for your question and first of all as we highlighted with council last month that we have some impacts from covert in relation to staff and we had about a reduction of about 25 and we are we do have a backlog in our open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distribution of mowers and ospo 's areas we have over 325 hectares of open space that we do manage and uh with that i suppose the breakup for that is in innersville about 52 percent of that is covered um in mission beach and alaris is only 14 uh tully is about 24 and cardwell 's 9 so we have supplied council with uh distribution of our resources in relation to that and i suppose with um two things that we currently are working on which is our open space improvement plan looking how we uh the levels of service and also the distribution of those staff across the region so to be a regional price based on levels of service not just townships and also how we go about doing our crew by function pieces so but um i was sent some information where the area goes so in the innisfail area is such a huge area compared to other areas and same with card well it travels a long way south so that we have to be responsible for would i be correct in saying that yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do mobilize our staff across the region where the needs are and that 's based on the levels of service and obviously higher order parks get a higher level of service and a lower order gets a lower level of service as as highlighted at the beginning we do have some pressures and some backlog that has been occurred due to staff impacts from covered that 's all cancer chewy counselor can i just follow on that one as well um just with that mr sadler we 're also still doing the work the prison work camp crews as well aren 't we so yes so through the chair count as informed earlier this week with um the work camp resources are definitely in lockdown still we will continue to work with corrections on that and obviously as covert changes throughout the region and through their procedures hopefully we 'll get them back soon so it 's through the chair yeah council millwood oh yeah so crew boy function was brought to us saying that we are going to see more efficiency so hopefully in the near future these types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little less noticeable is that right through the chair that is one factor of this and as i highlighted earlier that we have had reduction in staff due to covert but yes it will help us deploy our resources across the region better in relation to our levels of service thank you council millwood council chewie thank you mr sadler um yeah just i 'd just now like to just mention that the community grants have been are made available to different sporting cultural groups they can apply environmental groups ms hanson has sat in in the libraries in both in all areas innosphere mission beach tully and cardwell for people to come in and consult with her so rather than just go haphazardly through an application she 's been able to provide some guidance on the best best process in applying 5 p.m tomorrow is the last date time and date that the applications can come in and i believe we have quite a lot and i 'm looking forward to uh to hearing about them so i just invite community if you haven 't done so already um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your application in because it 's a great opportunity to to grow your your group and put a positive impact on the community thank you thank you council chewie any further general business councilor barnes thank you mr may um we spoke earlier about the lifting of covert it 's just around the corner i have had a lot of uh concerns about the cam the kirima range because i know with the lifting of covered uh there is going to be a major increase in traffic so after a personal inspection the other day and dealing with the officers i do know that it 's on our upcoming works list also in previous meetings you may have heard myself and other counsellors um hammering home about the cleaning of signs by tmr well our local rotary club here who are real doers as we know uh have put their hand up and will be very shortly dealing with tmr and wish to take the cleaning of those signs on themselves if it 's okayed by tmr yes well done to the local rotary club um also time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hull heads tully heads for uh which we heard about an open space policy by mr sadler that survey is taking on what we should be doing in that area for safety and for better public usage so that closes shortly and that 's it for me mr mayor thank you councillor barnes any uh cancer yeah mr chair just uh two quick questions uh mr sadler at a meeting not too long ago i asked about the operational hours for the stoddas hills the transfer station do you have any information on that at this present time through the chair councillor pervin yes i sent an update to council earlier this week in relation to we 're looking at how our shifts and hours are distributed across the team to look at how we can minimize any uh increase in operational expenditure with with your request there is some consultations that is occurring with the staff and uh we 'll have an update the next week or so back to council on uh options in relation to how to how to deliver or give that service that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um one more while you 're there we 're coming up to our tourist season very soon and another thing that 's very close to my heart is the information center at the innisfail conservatorium do we have any advancements there on costings and things like that so through the chair council pervin as discussed with a number of councillors earlier in the week the visitor information services strategy is almost complete um the there is some review being undertaken in relation to that action plan as previously highlighted with council we will bring that for a counsellor workshop is programmed for march and uh based on that workshop we 'll then finalize that report thank you council urban any further general business i just want to finish with a statement about the queen 's platinum jubilee february 2022 marks 70 years since the queen 's session understandably for the

conduct message please address council officers by their surname not their christian name we have had a contact who 've been watching our meetings live stream and uh protocol is that when a officer is uh presenting their report uh it 's mr singh or mrs bradley not their first name if you don 't mind uh with those few words of introduction i 'll now hand over to uh ceo james to present the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgence uh the development of this budget has been extremely taxing as i 'm sure all the councillors are aware given the workshops that we 've put together leading through to to this particular point in time the challenge has been exacerbated because of financial difficulties faced by local governments generally throughout queensland if not australia and in particular the impact that covert had last year with our operational expenditure being escalated and their capex conversely being decreased the budget seeks to strike an appropriate balance between maintaining council 's sound financial position whilst not placing too heavy a burden on the rate payers by way of substantial rate increases the impact on the projected long-term financial position is also an important consideration and council has endeavoured to strike a suitable balance between the current financial challenges and its long-term financial sustainability my expectation is that this budget and the next will both be quite challenging uh in our movement towards recovery uh from the uh the covert situation um as a result of uh extent financial pressure council has reviewed its service levels and model of service delivery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved to reduce operational expenditure council for the first time engaged with the community consultative group to seek feedback on council 's draft services catalog which was a successful project and considered options available in achieving a balance between the rating strategy and the service delivery approaches by way of background mr chairman the development of the budget has excuse me has been quite difficult the budget provides for a total operating expenditure of 83.42 million 83.42 million and operating expenses of 83.408 million giving us a very modest surplus of twelve thousand dollars in terms of revenue the challenging economic climate over the past years resulted in no real growth in council 's revenue base the subdued epic economic conditions continuing recovery from covert 19 and interest rates being extraordinarily low and historically low have all impacted upon council 's projected earnings as a result council 's general rates and utility charges are proposed to increase by 1.98 and 2.3 percent respectively in order to cover for increases in operational expenditure the cost of operational has increased because wage and salary costs for the employment of council staff now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro rated factored in december 2021 and a vacancy savings of around three hundred thousand in operating expenditure uh council will commence the management of its all its waste transfer stations new positions have been factored into the budget however this has been offset by a reduction in materials and services significant costs for the renewal of insurance cover to adequately to adequately insure council 's assets it 's anticipated that insurance costs will increase by at least 10 at least 10 percent uh having said that 250 000 savings has been factored into the budget uh as council has reviewed its deductible amount and updated the list of assets insured the depreciation express for council 's assets was projected to increase by about 1.87 million taking it to 28.3 million total depreciation which is a very heavy figure for a council of this size and it 's atypical when compared with other councils throughout queensland the increase relates to valuation movements changes and accounting standards associated with the right of use of assets leases completion of new capital works and the restoration of assets damaged due to weather events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saving of about four hundred thousand dollars has been factored into this budget as a result of the ongoing financial pressures that council suffers it 's been necessary to further review the services it provides across the range of areas in order to reduce operating expenses excuse me council in preparing this budget has considered a number of new operational initiatives and some of the key funded initiatives uh highlighted as the planning scheme uh amendment new planning scheme local champions program events placement program dogs off leash zone feasibility study reconciliation action plan the appointment of business and industry liaison coordinator capex includes the capital budget includes a works program of 35.4 million the program allows for the completion of outstanding capital works from 2021 anticipated at 10.4 million summary of the new capital works program excluding carryovers includes infrastructure and delivery services 21.31 million uh office of the ceo 1.03 million water 5.97 million sewage 3.9 million waste management 3.21 million all of the details of the projects are included in appendices g and h of the budget papers before you and with your permission mr chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council determines that however it 's important that i acknowledge the the work done by mr singh who in my view is an outstanding cfo um and council i believe is very very fortunate to have his dedicated service and in mentioning mr singh uh i also mentioned the rest of his team ms bradley who 's at the table mr smith is at the back of the room and all of the team i won 't go through every single one of them who loyally and faithfully do very difficult work for this council and i might add to it cheerfully and well on that note mr gemini i invite you to take a resolution uh thank you mr ceo so the first resolution uh in the budget is the chief executive 's office of budget report would somebody move the recommendation please move by councillor chewie second to boy councillor barnes all in favor it 's carried unanimously thank you i 'll now deliver the mayor 's speech in terms of the 2021-2022 budget councillors right now we are in unprecedented times and this is a budget designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to minimise this year 's rate increase whilst presenting a realistic budget that ensured that council could sustainably fund services existing infrastructure and new facilities that have been identified as important to our community in 2021 we see the continued impact and recovery efforts of the covert 19 pandemic and council has worked hard to retain a low rate increase that abuts the expected cpi increase to reflect the pressure on individuals and families at this time understandably in this current economic climate a priority for this council is to be careful with our spending while still delivering a budget that is achievable and fair to the community this budget reflects our commitment to achieving our corporate planned vision which seeks to strike a balance which is central to our community 's desire to see the whole of the cashery coach region as a place placed with increasing opportunities for residents to live and work where the region 's assets meets the council other communities needs a place with healthier and more sustainable lifestyles and a place that has a healthy natural environment councillors the budget i present today a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a budget that invests in our region our community and our future councillors i am proud to say that today i present to you a budget that supports the community 's long-term and immediate priorities i submit the budget for your consideration uh we now move on to uh budget resolution two significant differences report and uh will you speak to the uh miss bradley will speak to this of significant the current financial year apologies my michaelson the report i 've got in front of you today is report on the explanation of significant differences so this provides a forecast of our estimated sorry of our operating and capital revenue expenditure for the current financial year 2021 compared with our adopted budget so the estimated actuals are mostly a reflection of our 11th month budget review which has been adopted by council at the end of may so overall council 's estimated financial operating position for the 2021 financial year it 's anticipated to be a deficit against a small surplus that was budgeted for the current financial year the table a details where those movements are which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so firstly our fees and charges our estimated results are expecting to be over budget by 12 relating to our increased fees and charges around building applications and inspections trade waste and camping fees offset by some reduced landing fees in our aerodromes as well as development applications so interest we are still experiencing low interest rates as the mayor said earlier interest on investments are expected to be 317 000 or 24 under budget due to those reduced interest rates uh keeping in mind we have reduced that budget risk throughout the year as well and we brought our budget in line uh where possible the third item to note is our sales and recoverable works expected to be under budget by 12 due to externally contracted jobs overestimated in the original budget offset by reduction in those goods and services associated with delivering that those works the next item to note is our other income with estimated results being over budget by 34 due to increased job keeper subsidy that we 've received for our trainees and apprentices grants and subsidies is estimated to be under budget as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance charges are expected to be over budget by 231 000 due to an increase in the winding back of discount rates on council 's refuse restoration provision depreciation is also expected to be over budget which is a budget risk we have been speaking about throughout the year uh by 995 000 which is four percent approximately 278 000 relating to water 185 with intangible assets 200 000 with surge 35 000 with marine and plant and equipment 243 000. in addition to that item 8 relates to our gain on asset disposal which is our process from sale of fleet items offset by loss on disposal due to the timing of our capital projects as well as the capitalization process predominantly with roads bridges and footpaths so council 's estimated position at 30 june 21 is reflective of our economic conditions that we have faced during this financial year there are still end of financial year adjustments to be undertaken and june results to be reflected in these forecast figures some of the key challenges that has affected this result include the completion of our capital projects our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates for our refuse restoration provision these challenges will continue as interest rates are expected to remain low during the next financial year increasing operational costs and environmental factors becoming increasingly challenging so to summarise the report forecasts a deficit operational financial result which highlights council 's inability to meet one of the three financial sustainability measures and council will need to ensure that measures are in place to achieve an operating surplus for the future year which the new budget is expected to deliver so through the chair i just wanted to add on uh counselors just be mindful this is a estimate that we have done at a point in time which is probably a month ago uh so in between then to now figures may have changed and then also we still have to go through the audit process between now and september so i think going back to this report so this is more a summary of this year and where we see us finishing this year versus what our budget was to then going through the process and trying to finalize those numbers so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estimates from that report to build our budget is something that that 's how we try and connect the figures so just be mindful of that thank you mr singh uh thank you mr bradley any questions for the officer if not would somebody move uh the budget recommend a resolution number two significant differences report moved by councillor bain second boy council millwood all in favor carried unanimously thank you uh we now move on to budget resolution three the revenue policy and uh mrs bradley will speak to this report thank you mr good morning councillors good morning right so in terms of the process of the budget so the next couple of recommendations actually would be our policies our plans and our guidelines so we 'll go through those and then following followed by that we 'll also look at our significant business activities and then going into financials and then also the community report so that 's the next couple of reports that we 'll go through to start the process off firstly i 'd like to thank the staff directors managers and the finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process so there 's a lot of work that happens between end of feb to june and um it 's a challenge trying to bring it all together so i think it 's i 'm glad to have the team that we have and also i would like to also thank you for your contribution during the process uh in in addition to that i also wanted to acknowledge the work that 's being done by the community consultation group members uh particularly the feedback they gave us through the budget process and then also acknowledge the work of michelle freeman who has been kindly helping us with the process so they are the some of the individuals that i wanted to mention this morning the actual budget process again we started off in february we went through a number of cis sessions and for this year we actually embraced a new concept and the new concept was doing budget buy services so that 's something that council has started this year and i think that 's something we 'll try and continue to build on uh just going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy that we will go through this morning is actually our revenue policy so the revenue policy itself it sets out the principles that council uses uh in terms of levying of rights and charges and how we exercise our powers to grant rebates and concessions uh it also allows us to recover unpaid amounts of rates and charges and also come up with the methodology for cost recovery um so without going into too much detail counselors the the policy itself is on page 15 of the budget papers uh it also sets out how we make in levy and also governs through a number of regulatory requirements so without going into too much detail and it 's a it 's a simple policy uh mr mayor the recommendation this morning is that councillors adopt the revenue policy uh thank you mr singh any question for the officer if not would somebody move budget resolution three the revenue policy moved by councillor pervin seconded by councillor chewie all in favor carry unanimously thank you move on to budget resolution for the revenue statement and mr singh we 'll speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process we we need to adopt our revenue statement in our revenue statement actually outlines and explains the revenue raising measures adopted by council in preparation of the budget i will take us through the revenue statement in a bit more detail so that starts on page 18 of the budget papers councillors so in terms of the legislative requirements so we have section 172 of the local government regulation that provides guidance on that particular revenue statement and it also under section 94 is what allows us to make and levy rates and charges um so council has historically used the different differential general rates um as approach to levy and at the moment council has 22 rating categories and those rating categories are identified on page 3 and page 4 of the report and also page 5 council so in on page 6 for this year under table b we have the 22 rating categories and the rate in the dollar and also the minimum figures so in terms of changes to the rating category council so in line with the recommendation from the rating reference group and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly the short for around revenue and also increased in increases in expenditure council has increased its rate in the dollar by 1.98 for 21 categories apart from the um the industrial category we where we have increased our rates a little bit more in line with the recommendations whereby the recommendation is to at some stage bring uh commercial and industrial rate in the dollar and make it align so for this year council has only uh increased uh the industrial category a little bit more which is around 2.5 percent which is reflected in the in the minimum rates and also the the rate in the minimum dollars um so in terms of the the couple of next items on the policy itself on page seven councillors so we also levy uh the transport levy and the environmental level so for this financially a council has increased our transport levy from 138 dollars to 145 dollars the environmental levy has been increased from 210 dollars to 214 dollars which is an increase of four dollars in terms of uh levy of special charges uh we have um the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire brigade special charges so they are still part of the budget process so they are five and the special charge is twenty dollars and twenty five dollars um council in terms of the water um water charges um so the first one is our water excess charge and for this financial year council has increased our charges by three percent so the three percent generally is associated with our infrastructure uh and we have invested a significant amount of money over the last couple of years uh throughout the region trying to ensure we have we eliminate boil water outlets and then also ensuring that we we have water security going forward so uh in in tatsu we have been lucky enough to not have any boil water leads in the tully in mission beach region so so this allows us to recoup some money forward and continue our investment in our infrastructure so that 's why we 've sort of gone a little bit higher and that 's gone up by three percent so in terms of the water consumption charge council so just to ensure that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the water prices being the same for the region uh in acknowledging our our strategies going forward where we are trying to encourage people to um use water and and use it in a you know efficient manner so council has reduced our tf4 water from 450 kilo liters down to 425 and the increase in the charges for water consumption has for the first year has seen an increase of four cents and for the second year it 's seen an increase of five cents so that takes the first t up to 99 cents from 95 last year in dollar 90 to from dollar 85 from last year we have seen a slight reduction in our marginal water unit rate which is used to calculate concession water concessions particularly for leaks that has seen a slight reduction from 30 cents down to 27 cents in terms of serious charges councillors so we have seen a slight increase in sewage so it has gone up by 1.7 we had worked hard previously to bring the sewage figures down from 1040 to 999 for the for the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit more so we 've actually gone above a thousand dollars now um and we we acknowledge there 's more work to be done so the council will continue doing uh more work in in either finding efficiencies or looking at alternative ways of improving um how we do things going on from there counselors just on page 11 we have our trade waste charges uh then on page 12 the utility charge for uh trade waste has seen an increase of around two percent uh onto our waste charges on page thirteen uh councillors so why is charges again um as the ceo mentioned before so we are uh in the process of uh running the business ourselves uh but what we 're facing with this year is uh in the month of july uh sorry going forward in the month of july uh we 'd be duplicating services where we 'll see a overlap of a month where the contractor would be continuing to provide services but we have been put on where the additional burden of uh finding staff and recruiting staff and trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget so that 's why there has been a slight increase in cost but we are also going forward investing in infrastructure so mainly we are looking at upgrading our mission beach transfer station in the next 12 months and then also the storage hill where we will increase our our facilities or more like we will be looking at in in terms of the infrastructure we 'd be looking at investing more in the storage storage hill um transfer station uh particularly to do with landfills um so in in factoring all those though so council was still able to minimize the increase in waste charges so we have only gone up by one point four percent as an increase in waste charges um so council is just on page 15 um one of the things that i wanted to highlight this year um we have last year affected in um the implications of uh covered and we had given our ratepayers more time to pay their rates uh in in that case we had given them 60 days for the first rate cycle but we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covert here as a region and also in terms of this year we are revealing back to our 30 days rates notice periods so that 's under 9.2 um at the top of the page 15 uh in terms of discounts counselors so last year we made a decision to reduce our discounts to 15 to 10 percent so this year council will continue with the 10 discount rate and that 's something that 's highlighted on page 15. um interest on overdue rates and charges counselors so [Music] we do charge interest on overdue rights historically the rates uh the interest on rate figures have been high but in the last couple of years we 've seen a change in methodology so the new methodology that has been used for the from last year and in this year uh we use the benkeil figures that are provided by the reserve bank and on top of that there is a fixed figure of eight percent so the bank yield figures have reduced to 0.03 so the outstanding rates for next year in terms of interest on overdue rates and charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our concession policies council so we have factored in concessions for pensioners not-for-profit consumers who use home dialysis machines and then also there is a concession that 's available for undetected concealed water leaks and we are continuing to provide those and also uh in terms of uh 9.6 which is on page 16 uh there 's a section which covers off on our refund of rates and charges uh again they 're sort of covered on a case by case basis uh councils on page 17 uh are our land use codes and the legislation also requires us to ensure that we have the map for the areas for the fire levels so appendix ae has those maps in the areas that are covered by the fire levy and with those um i 'm happy to take any questions um and then we can move the recommendations thank you mr singh so you 've uh just delivered the report on uh resolution four five and six correct yep uh just uh four and yes we can cover five forty five okay uh any questions for mr singh uh if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved by councillor barnes seconded by councillor permanent all in favor carried unanimously budget resolution five interest on overdue rates and charges any questions for the officers if not but somebody moved the recommendation please councillor millwood moved councillor perv and second all in favor carried unanimously thank you so we now move on to budget resolution six the rating concessions policy councillors uh so the rate inconsistent policy is on page 40 of the report the policy itself as i mentioned before um covers the four different areas in the four different areas mainly being the pensioner concessions uh councillors we are retaining the same figure for pensioners for this year which is a maximum of three hundred dollars and up to fifty percent remissions uh is what we are factoring in the budget which is same we haven 't changed it uh we have seen um a change in the profiles obviously our aging demographics um where we have seen an increase in in the figure we reinvest but council is happy to maintain that figure for now uh we also have brought in concession for uh water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in technology and us using smart meters the policy has been updated to reflect both uh situations one is the smart meter and the other is the the normal meters that we have in the policy uh we have now brought in a section which is on page 43 which covers off um in terms of uh exceptional circumstances associated with water the relevant director or the ceo can grant uh consensus up to five thousand dollars without coming to council i think that 's something that that saves time uh and it improves customer experience because in the past we 've had where we 've had to bring reports to council and sometimes it does take a bit of time so we 're hoping that we can help and improve our customer experience in its space by delegating that to the ceo and also the directors we have also affected in in the policy [Music] something that 's new and what we have identified is we we do send out water leak not notices so one of them is our high consumption water uh notice and the other one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we email out or we normally post out so this is more informing our customers that they have a leak uh and then they need to identify where the leak is and get a plumber in to fix it so what we have done with the policy is we are giving them 60 days to to make sure that they are there looking at that and then getting plumbers in to fix it uh but in the policy itself what we we what we are acknowledging though is uh there can be situations where it 's hard for us to get plumbers in in within that period so the period before was 30 days so we have increased it to 60 but we 're also acknowledging that in some situations they might not be able to do that within 60 days so we 'll be still giving them the flexibility to still uh apply for concessions and then we can walk with the customer to to make sure that they are eligible for that council is the next part on that uh policy itself on page 44 he talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed any of that so what council has done last year we are going to continue doing the same and then to finish off with the last section on the policy uh it covers off the concession for the home water dialysis so uh which is a good initiative to to have uh and we have removed from the policy um any of the combat 19 initiatives that we had initially so with that uh mr mayor i 'm happy to take questions or we can go to the resolution thank you mr singh any questions for the officer councillor chewie not a question thank you mr singh just uh thank you for acknowledging the shortage of plumbers because that i know in community that has been an issue that people are dreading getting that letter and then struggling to find a plumber so i 'm glad that we have acknowledged that because it is a problem thank you any further questions for the officer if not would somebody move budget resolution six the rating concession policy moved by council permanent second by council chewie all in favor carried unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investment policy and mr singh will speak to this one council is um our investment policy sets the guidelines and the boundaries for investment um of council surplus cash balances so again acknowledging the low interest rates that we 've seen in the market and we 're probably the point where we 're seeing the lowest interest rates so generally council 's um interest rates range now from around point six percent to point eight percent uh the goats that we 're getting from the market are way below so historically what we used to do was uh invest a lot of money with queensland treasury corporation but but what we have seen is the rates are quite low even offered by the qedc so what we have done with the policy and this is something we updated last year where we are giving ourselves a bit more flexibility so counselors i draw your attention to page 50. so on page 50 we have our credit risk guidelines so what you can see now in the policy is that we have said qdc capital guaranteed cash funds the minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now been is is now zero uh whereas in the past we used we used to have a capping of 10 million so we 've moved away from it and then we 've also got flexibility now to invest a bit more with the aaa rated uh banks or financial institutions again similar double a uh and then we 've also now brought in other tiers which is uh triple b negative uh where we can invest around 25 percent of our investment with them so this is all about giving us a bit more flexibility where we can if we can source better rates we 'll use um other institutions but in a sort of in a manner where we 're still trying to manage our risk and not expose council to any challenges in the future so that 's that 's the table that 's the main table in terms of i guess all the other processes and the other items on the policy there has been no change to those in the manager finance continues to have visibility over the cash fund and she uh gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximize our investment uh where wherever possible so so with that uh councils i would recommend that we adopt the investment policy thank you mr singh any questions for mr singh if not with somebody moved budget resolution seven the investment policy moved by council millwood seconded by council obama 's all in favour let 's carry unanimously thank you we now move on to budget resolution eight the debt policy and mr singh will present this one so counselors the the debt policy itself is a policy framework for council in terms of how we borrow money to fund our capital budget so we don 't borrow to fund our operational budget we borrow to fund our capital budget so the policy is a guideline so uh so one of the things that we have identified with with debt so similarly uh the flow on effect from low interest rate is you can also borrow money cheap so that is something that 's quite uh prevalent in the market but we have been very cautious about borrowing money uh and we have borrowed um in the last 12 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around one percent for seven years uh the intent behind that is to lock the money in for seven years and hopefully we can um maximize on investment going forward once the investment rates start standing uh the policy policy itself uh councils there has been a minor change so in the external loans section of the policy uh under item d on page 53 counselors um previously what we used to have is we used to have a loan theme used to be between 10 and 20 years uh what we have done is change the loan time to be 7 to 20 years [Music] and that 's mainly to give us a bit more flexibility particularly with qdc whereby we 've seen the way they structure the rights sometimes what we find is the seven year rate is probably a better rate to go within the 10-year rate so that 's more giving us a bit more flexibility so but particularly when you look at the difference between seven and ten um sometimes we when we analyze our numbers we think there 's a there 's a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven then ten but that 's something we do in line with our long term financial plan so it 's not a decision we just make by looking at this year we look at how it impacts us in the longer term so that 's one change so as i mentioned before councillors we have a debt of three million um in the intent behind it was to maximize on on the cheap rates that we have and then um have a bit of a cash surplus to then be in a position where going forward if the rates stand we start making money out of that money uh and then also in terms of the policy itself we do have a section which talks about internal loans um and we will utilize internal loans where we can using our own cash reserves but at the moment i think the expectation is more we we maximize external borrowings where we can in bulk up on our reserves uh going forward in terms of proposed borrowing council so we are uh as part of the budget process looking at borrowing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassess it if our cash position changes or the rate position changes but in the meantime in our long term financial plan that 's the only borrowings we have we have affected in uh but we are going to go through a process of looking at our asset management plans which may influence what we borrow in the longer term so with that um i 'm happy to take any questions counselors any questions for mr singh if not would somebody move budget resolution eight the debt policy moved by council chewie seconded by councillor barnes all in favor carried unanimously thank you and move on to budget resolution nine the rights recovery policy and mr singh will present this one so councillors the rights recovery policy um it allows us to ensure effective and timely recovery of outstanding debts and within our policy we have a number of payment arrangements so there 's a couple of key ones that we have is the formal arrangements the general arrangements and then we have the informal arrangements plus the short term arrangement so and as part of the covet process we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um for for us in terms of helping us with in the customers but there is something that we have taken out but the policy itself that we have at the moment gives us enough flexibility um and also the ratepayers to come in and make arrangements so i think for now this is sufficient for what we need and it 's actually uh it gives us more flexibility when we compare our policy with other councils i think we 're actually doing more than what some of the others are doing uh in terms of the recovery actions uh council is none of that has sort of changed uh there has been a change uh with the land of the sale of land for overdue rates uh obviously in the past the process allowed us to negotiate with the highest bidder as part of the auction process but the legislation has changed whereby going into the sale of land for outstanding rates uh council sets the reserve uh but unfortunately we are not in a position where uh we can sell below the reserve price so whatever the reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously used it for our last auction and it 's part of the process i guess one of the challenges that the council will have going forward is we may not be in a position to sell land that has outstanding rates particularly because of the i guess the economic conditions but also um where we are as a region so i think that 's something that we might have to at some stage going forward provide a bit of feedback to the state um particularly when we draft legislation so it 's it 's probably easier when you are in an area which is growing and um there 's a lot of development that 's happening in land is scarce uh and the market is quite aggressive um whereas we are not sort of in that region so i think what we 'll do is we 'll assess how we go in the next 12 months and then if there 's any feedback we 'll obviously provide it to the department through the ceo council bond council bonds oh yeah through the chair uh yeah mr singh why why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a outstanding rate and not have any ability to get the money at all now we 've got councillors going to an lgaq conference etc maybe that 's a something that we should be putting on their agenda agree um i guess there 's two parts to this yes technology or comment around we need to probably raise this going forward so i think we 're happy to do that but i think on the other hand what we probably would recommend is we we wait and see if we have another auction and see how that goes so there 's enough data to validate this as well so probably in the next 12 months but we should provide that feedback on the other hand the reason why i can take some i can make some guesses of why probably one of the reasons is that they would have probably identified that some councils may not have been following the process when going into negotiations uh because it wasn 't the negotiation process can be not sometimes may not be documented so normally it 's two people negotiating uh that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be ratepayers or customers who in their mind feel that the value of their land is is high and council has gone in and sold it for less through the negotiation process so what this does is actually saves guards the the property owner whereby there is a fixed amount which is purely based on the market value assessment that has been undertaken and if that means that then they get their money back if it doesn 't then it doesn 't whereas in the past um through the process you could end up selling a property slightly below than what the market value could have been so that 's probably more to save got the the lender the land holders and maximize their return on investment is probably where they 're coming from through you mr chairman but what if the land owner doesn 't wish to pay eight point three percent for another year until it 's sold what if the land owner just wants to sell the land it 's through the chair the land holder can 't do that so through the legislation they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that is in the legislation so they 're still in care that cost uh this doesn 't diminish or change any of the existing processes so what it does is that if you can 't sell it then the land stays there for another 12 months when we go to the next auction process or six months depending on when we decide to go out for auction again uh but that 's one of the one of the challenges through that but again on the other hand it 's it 's good for the for the land holders but i just wanted to flag it that 's there that 's the change in the policy and that 's something we 'll continue to reassess and see how it impacts us and apart from that councillors most of the other items on the policies are pretty much similar to what we have done in the past thank you mr singh any questions for the officer if not would somebody move budget resolution 9 the rates recovery policy moved by council permanent seconded by councillor baines all in favor carried unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kessler coast development incentive which is on page 61 of the budget papers the the policy itself uh it encourages development and it is designed to achieve certain strategic objectives for council whereby we allow a reduction in additional pedestrial charges for series over a period of 24 months so this is for uh for investors who come in the region and one of the things that has been flagged with us is our sewage charges are fairly high when we benchmark us against other councils in other areas so the intent behind this policy is that there 's a bit of flexibility whereby um if we look at page 62 uh on page 62 the table uh sort of gives us a good summary where if it 's a new if it 's a property that has 10 or if it 's a property which has greater than 10 or equal to or less than 25 new pedestals then council will provide 50 reduction on the additional pedestal charge and then if it 's a property or a development which is greater than 25 then we are looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulate and help with the with attracting new um investors in the region and i think 3.3 does highlight those eligible criteria which sits underneath so it 's it 's an existing policy so what we are recommending it council continue with this policy uh and this is a policy which is in addition to a number of other policies that are run through the planning section of council so happy to take commencement thank you mr singh any questions for mr singh uh first council of bones then council norwood thank you mr chairman i think an important piece to highlight in this as well is that that reduction is only for the first 24 months and then once that 's once that period is complete that the developer goes sorry i got him before your truth the developer goes into paying oh sorry the development itself goes into paying full charges whoever 's paying the charges at the time which would probably be to the radical properties of whomever else but thanks for the clarification it 's getting the people in getting the money started giving them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're back paying what everyone else will pay in the future same thing all right all good questions mr singh if not would somebody move budget resolution 10 activate cashew case development incentive public policy moved by councillor millwood second by councillor permanent all in favor carried unanimously thank you we move on to budget resolution 11 trade waste environmental management plan and mr singh will present so councillors uh the next item uh is our trade ways environmental management plan so the purpose of this plan is to set up our set up a consistent framework on how council manages trade ways discharges and then also how we meet our obligations under our legislation in in various other legislations in license um councils without going through uh this trade waste environmental management plan it 's a fairly complex document and it has got a number of different components which actually allows our sewage in the water team to to walk out what needs to be done it has an approval process and there 's a number of conditions that sit within the plan we haven 't made any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexities of the plan i 'm happy to take any questions and recommend that we adopt the plan thank you mr singh any questions for mr singh if not would somebody move budget resolution levied the trade waste environmental management plan moved by councillor chewie seconded by councillor barnes all in favor carried unanimously thank you we move on to budget resolution 12 services services management guideline mr singh uh councillors um last year we started the process of developing our services catalog the service management line guideline provides us a way of determining and recording what services are provided by council and what is the standard and level of those services that are delivered so it 's part of our ongoing process where one of the things we 're trying to link back to is a link back our budget to our services so not only staff and council but also the community starts understanding the different services that council provides and the and the level of service that council provides and what is it it costs to provide those services so the guideline itself is something that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then within the guideline a number of principles that us that set out how we conduct our business so and we 're trying to change the way we do um business so in terms of the policy itself i guess the crucial part of the policy uh and something that we have walk with the community consultative committee with is we we started the process of um starting to identify identify what council in the community thinks of some of these services so for example what services are important and what are not um so we have on page 127 the table and the table sort of helps us to determine what is the important scale and also what is the satisfaction scale and we start benchmarking and start measuring our services there are other aspects of this uh guideline that is something that council will pursue in the next 12 months so one of them is also looking at looking at our community plans uh we 're also going to look at our customer experience strategy and then also part of that is making sure we are updating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those awards um and with the view that we 'll continue to walk on this guideline and build from here onwards i would recommend that council out of this guideline thank you mr singh any questions for mr singlets councillor bones less a question mr chairman and more a comment councillor pervin and i attended as observers on the day when the services catalog catalog guidelines went to the community consultative committee um great process and the the piece that really interested me was it was eyes from outside the organization looking over this and seeing the differences a huge amount of similarities but there were some differences as well within the satisfactory ratings and the importance rating so great process and i look forward to going it going forward in the future so i would move the recommendation thank you councillor bones and seconded by councillor pervin all in favor it 's carried unanimously thank you we now move on to budget resolution 13 code of competitive conduct mr singh is it mr singh yes yes ms bradley okay thank you uh so the report we have in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive conduct so council is required to decide each year if it will apply the code of competitive conduct to our business activities for the following financial year as under the local government regulations a change was made last last financial year that requires council to apply the apply the code to its water and sewage business units as they are above the significant business activity threshold so council may voluntarily elect to apply the code of competitive conduct to business activities that are not prescribed business unit activities part of the reform process includes applying full cost pricing to those business activities and the removal of any competitive advantage or disadvantage where possible which is the application of the competitive neutrality principle so the thresholds for the 21 22 financial year for water and sewage is based on the number of number of premises premises are connected to a water service at 30th of june for each financial year which is set at 10 000 or more and any other business activity the threshold is set at 9.7 million so applying the code requires application of full cost pricing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll take you through a bit further and the elimination of advantages and disadvantages of public ownership within the activity so commercially competitive prices for goods and services by ensuring our projected revenue from those activities is enough to cover those projected costs of conducting the activity and the removal of any competitive advantage or disadvantage so if council business activities do not reach that prescribed threshold council is able to choose to apply that code of competitive conduct to those activities with the exceptions being road business activities relating to the department of maine roads and the building certification services for which it 's mandatory to apply that code to so councils reviewed our current significant business activities against those thresholds and it 's been tabled in this report where water and sewage council currently has a bit over 13 000 connections which is above the threshold therefore council is required to apply the code to that business activity and waste management services uh currently sitting at 8.7 million which is under the threshold of 9.7 million therefore it is an in excess of that threshold so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply the code to water and sewage business activities as it exceeds the number of water connections and council is not required to apply the code of competitive conduct to its waste management business activities as it 's currently under that threshold so in addition to this council needs to put forward a our code of competitive conduct statement which is on page 135 uh to which the code of competitive conduct applies so if council uh forms the resolution to apply the code of competitive conduct to water and sewage activities uh the estimated activity statement um is tabled on page 135 with estimated surplus of 2.4 million for those two activities and an estimate of the cost of carrying out community service obligations for those services so that includes where council provides initial call out and inspections for water leaks which isn 't charged on to the consumer which a commercialized organization could charge that so we 're removing that that particular item and the concession for water consumption which would also be uh the commercial organizations at their discretion whether or not they charge that in sewage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of charge and the sewage concession for not-for-profit organizations so the community service obligation totals 300 an estimated 376 000. um so it is recommended that council applies the code of competitive conduct to water and sewage business activities and determines not to apply the code to waste and any other business activity during the 21 22 financial year thanks ms bradley just clarification councillors there 's two dot points the recommendation one that code of conduct competitive conduct does apply to water and sewage but it does not apply to waste or any other business uh any questions for ms bradley if not would somebody move the recommendation please moved by councillor millwood second boy councillor barnes all in favor carried unanimously thank you we move on to budget resolution 14 the 2021 2022 financial statements and mr singh will present counsellors um budget resolutions 14 uh 15 and 16 go hand in hand so what i will start off with is i will take us to page 151 so take us away page 151 and on page 151 we 'll start off with our comprehensive income statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of idea and this is our our 10 year forecast going going forward um so just feeding off what james sort of covered off earlier in terms of our starting year uh our net rates and levies and charges so council so you can see like our estimated figure for this year is around 67 million uh what we are forecasting for next year is around 68.6 million so that in so that in itself includes a average general rate increase of 1.98 uh it also includes uh increases to water uh excess charge of three percent uh and then mine increases to consumption in the reduction in our water tears from 450 to 425 it includes increases in our waste charges by 1.4 percent uh it also includes charges uh increases in our serious charges so that 's what that number is 68.6 million and then going forward over the next 10 years uh we are sort of forecasting a increase of around two and a half percent going forward so that 's something we have model in to the budget over the next 10 years um we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges over the last couple of years uh so coming into this particular budget we have been lucky to turn it around so we are now forecasting an increase in our fees and charges going forward part of this is a reflection of council doing some hard work in our caravan parks whereby with the river drive and hopefully the caravan park in tully and others coming on board we 'll see more revenue going forward which should be good we are also looking at our rental income uh associated with our leases and other properties so that 's something that 's consistent going forward increasing uh we have seen a major change in our interest figures uh so gradually in the past council used to raise around 1.8 million dollars in interest in some cases it had gone up to around 2 million in the past going back a couple of years what where we are now is interest revenue has obviously dropped to around below a million dollars so that 's where we 've lost a lot of revenue and part of the challenge is this is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere and that 's why our ability to influence rate and utility charges has sort of reduced a little bit so with that in mind we are sort of forecasting increases going forward um in acknowledging that the interest rates are probably at their bottom point now so hopefully it is the other way going up not going into a negative uh that should so in terms of sales and other income so again we 're sort of forecasting consistent revenue increases going forward uh our capital revenue council as you can see uh we had estimated around 22 million is what we 're getting for this year as part of our capital budget process we are forecasting to pick up around 3.9 million next year for capital revenue and going forward we are sort of being very conservative and keeping a figure of around a million in some cases around 2 million so that 's being us being conservative but when we look at our historical trend uh we have the ability to attract between five to fifteen million dollars depending on where we are and what the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit but that figure doesn 't impact our operational result so when we say net result uh normally we don 't get bent smart or net so that 's something that just sits there but it 's good to be in a positive thought so the more money we pick up the less we use of our own money so which is good in terms of employee expenses so we are forecasting an increase so there is a jump from 26 million to 27.9 million which is close to 28. in that increase uh what we have seen is us transitioning and taking over the waste business so what has happened is we 'll be putting stuff on our books but where the reduction will come from is the reduction in the payments that we used to make to the contractor so overall uh we used to pay that to the contractor but what we 're doing now is paying it through us through the staff and still managing the contract in-house so that 's where the changes and then also in the budget we are sort of forecasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the later years to probably around 2.75 so that 's between 2.5 to 2.75 um cpi drives a lot of our assumptions so generally the reserve bank 's assumptions with cpi is that cpi will be between two to three percent so for the budget process we have used a similar sort of number going full card forward so that 's something we use we also keep an eye on our council cost index so generally the council cost index is close to cpi um so we also keep an eye on it but generally we use we use cpi for most of our calculations so materials and services councils you can see materials and services has dropped from 31 million to 26.9 million and this is where the reduction in the contract cost has come in whereby the reduction in the contract cost has been absorbed through the increases in the employee expenses in saying that though we 've also seen a change in some of our grant funding so in the past we had some money for w4q funding which was operational dollars that has now come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits coming through with the implementation of solar which has allowed us to reduce our electricity expenses uh we have looked at some other ways of doing business we 're looking at the service delivery models for some of the services which is allowing us to at least identify some savings within the budget we have seen increases associated with insurance so if we have inflated our insurance expenditure by 10 percent uh but then we have also pulled it back by 250 000 as a savings measure whereby we look at how we insure our own motor vehicles particularly looking at self-insuring and then we also have changed the deductibles figures and also we have reviewed what assets are being insured so that 's something that we are hoping that will give us a bit of savings but in addition to those we also seen increases in our normal contracts which are between cpi so between two to three percent is what we 've seen is contractors increasing their their cost and passing it on to us so that 's materials and services uh council is a depreciation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in increase of around a million to our forecasted figures but if we look at last year 's numbers it 's more than a million so probably around 1.3 million is what we are sort of forecasting in terms of depreciation increase there 's a couple of reasons for those so one obviously is we are now seeing our capital projects being capitalized and we 're seeing some of the major infrastructure projects being pushed through particularly new projects we have seen some valuation movements whereby we have seen a revolution of our water syrup assets and then also the buildings we have seen some changes in a lot of the time the cost the replacement cost of billing changes and we are in a region where the cost of replacement for buildings are pretty high even though the market value might not be that so so that 's the that has seen some changes and then we 've also seen the change in the accounting standards whereby because of the changes in the leasing standards uh with the leases that we 've had for some of the vehicles has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on that so there 's a number of different reasons but in addition to that uh what we 're also acknowledging is that there 's been work being done whereby staff are looking at assets and how we can factor in other obsolescence or we can come up with a different methodology of of doing depreciation going forward so there has been a savings of 400 000 affected into the budget plus with the work that council has done through the asset rationalization process uh that is where we affected in some savings so again it 's a council which has we we are a council that has 1.8 billion dollars worth of assets and the importance of having good asset management plans and also processes and systems in place that allows us to manage our asset base and i think in the past we have said it is costing the value of asset is around seventy five thousand dollars per rate pair so it 's a significant sum when we compare us with other councils uh and then in terms of capital expenditure council so you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but again going forward we are forecasting a lower figure um but that 's us sorry the capital expenses are forecasted at 510 but going forward we 're not forecasting a lot of numbers there that 's mainly us trying to offset not factoring in the capital revenue and by not factoring in the capital expenditure because it 's hard to forecast what 's what assets will be disposed and written off so that 's why we probably have to do a bit of work but then we also have some challenges with the model where we 're not able to factor in some of those numbers so that 's why we try and moderate both so overall council so you can see uh yes we are forecasting a deficit at a point in time which is around 7 17 but we 're going going forward we 're forecasting a small surplus for this year and then similarly we are forecasting small surpluses going out until we get to say june 31 where we are forecasting a surplus of 1.2 million but that 's mainly a reflection of us um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans because we we will see we see a reduction in our capital investment going forward so that 's where uh it 's important that we revisit our imps at some stage uh in terms of the the balance sheet which is uh on the next page uh council so again similarly in a similar fashion uh we are sort of forecasting similar numbers um i will touch on the cache figure in the next page but in terms of our borrowings and in terms of our liabilities again we 're fairly healthy we 're forecasting minimal change in our liabilities from 12.7 million to around 30 million in the 10 years very limited borrowings we are affecting in to our long-term financial plans and uh we do have a provision a bulk of our provision land relates to our landfill uh so going forward when we need to kept our landfills we have allocated and there 's money sitting for that so we are trying to make sure there 's sufficient funds going forward so that sort of sums up the balance sheet councils over the next 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the next page on 152 we have our cash flow so the forecast for the end of this year is around 45.7 million uh going into next year 's budget we 're forecasting a cash flow of 40.8 uh and then going forward gradually sort of dropping to 32 and then later on sort of picking up to around 48 million so from a cash flow point of view so again council is forecasted to be in a healthy position going forward and this is where we we do have the ability to fund our capital projects ourselves but again we 're looking at various options uh any if we have to borrow we borrow but that 's more around rated what we borrow and what we 're borrowing for uh and then on the next base counselors uh is our statement of changes in equity uh which just demonstrates to us the movement between our our financial or the comprehensive income and the balance sheet is what we pick up through the revenuation process so i would take us back to now at the beginning of appendix a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appendix c and d are actually coming from the 10-year forecast so the 10-year forecast actually has already identified those figures so so without repeating the whole conversation so that that 's just the three-year summary that sits in in the beginning and the 10-year summary is what we went through so literally what we 've done is picked up the three years and we have it there and that 's part of the i guess the legislative requirement allow it requires us to adopt two different measures so that 's the appendix a b and c and d uh council is appendix e which is on page 142. is a breakdown of the department figures at a very high level um just be mindful it also includes internal charges so that 's why that figure is 96 million and not 83 million but that just sort of gives us idea in terms of uh where the departmental expenditure is one of the things i can highlight from here though is uh council does rely on the water waste and sewage business to fund some of the general arm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses so that 's where you can see between water series and waste uh we 're picking up around 3.5 million dollars as a net figure or a surplus figure which is then offsetting our general business by a similar sort of number so that 's how we we 're balancing the budget at the moment so um on the next page uh by appendix f uh it goes in a bit more deeper so we are then dissecting the different departments by the programs or more like the sub programs and um that sort of tells us how and what proportion of the budget is allocated to the different departments and then councillors similarly next page appendix f sort of continues so so that 's the breakdown of the budget by departments and in sub programs uh going forward i think uh in the community uh report there 's an aspect of the services and that 's something that clear will touch on later on so from there on council is the next part of the report which is on page 145. on page 145 is a breakdown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was our operational budget and then this is now our capital budget so council is for for this year going going into uh next year what we are anticipating is a capital carryover of around 10.4 million dollars so the bottom you can see anticipated capital is carryover is 10.4 one of the things that we 've worked hard through the budget process is uh trying to position ourselves where we uh trying to reduce our carryovers and also trying to build a budget that is more deliverable so that we can demonstrate to the community that what we are budgeting for is what we 're actually trying to deliver so there is alignment between the two so so part of the reason uh is or part of the strategy has been that we have then also tried building a budget this year which is our capital budget of 35 million dollars which is a realistic budget and a deliverable budget with the focus that we 'll try and make sure we deliver those projects is something we 're trying to work hard on and at the same time trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind the total capital budget including carryovers is sitting at 45 million and how we are funding that 45 million dollars is we can see we are going we 're hoping to pick up some ground funding which is around 3.9 million uh we are planning to borrow uh from qdc uh if the rates are good in the next year and then also we are using some of our existing carryovers that we have sort of kept in reserves plus our depreciation which is funding our capital and then also prior funding which is that that is how we are trying to fund it so so core of the funding of our capital projects actually coming from council source funding and i think the conversation around depreciation and what we use depreciation for so generally depreciation does help fund our renewal so that 's the connection one of the things we 've done this year is we are not fully investing our depreciation of 28.3 million um so what you can see council source funding for this year is 22.4 million uh but that doesn 't mean we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets of around 35 million but that 's us trying to not um have too many projects that we can 't deliver so and that difference will normally go to reserve and we use that money to fund future projects when we need to fund future projects on the next page counselors uh which is our appendix height uh so appendix h has a bit more uh detail of what sits in terms of what is the program for different areas so billing trades we are budgeting for around 1.5 million world of projects um which includes some solar initiatives and investment in our building area building facilities and plus public infrastructure swimming pools in other areas uh we also got we have around 3.4 million dollars in our drainage program uh within the drainage program chunk of the money uh relates to the mission beach cbd upgrade so obviously there are drainage or stormwater components of the project associated with the master plan that we are funding or we are budgeting for but we are hoping that we will pick up some external funding that will supplement the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the likelihood of that particular project commencing this year is something that we that we are probably we are hoping that we 'll get the decision on the funding face before we start the week uh so there 's a there 's a likelihood that that particular project may not commence this year but again that 's us demonstrating our commitment to the cbd master plan uh and and we 'll commence the project once we have a decision on the on the external funding um we have allocated some money for our website upgrades in the internet we are continuing to invest in our i.t with the challenges of vulnerability and some of the other issues uh involved with it and investing in tech one we also got we have money allocated for marine facilities of around six hundred thousand dollars uh wrecking natural areas of 617 um we have also uh identified that we would be investing in our telescope student plan uh investment of around 1.3 million dollars a total investment of 3.9 in our storage infrastructure uh transport our continued commitments through to our reseal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key things that we have affected in the transport budget is our commitment to improve our capital delivery by factoring in uh some additional money for forward survey and design so one of the things we 're trying to make sure is that we are design ready and that 's why we 've allocated additional money through that process so that the projects are ready and we can start delivering more uh so there 's additional money located for that and there is around a million dollars allocated for culvert renewals the other project associated with the mission beach master plan so councils we are going to allocate um 450 000 to the mission beach cbd car park that 's the land we bought a couple of years ago and we 're trying to now convert it into a proper car park again a demonstration of a commitment to some of our master plans that we have and underneath that we also have our in israel cbd master plan our continued investment in that space and we 're looking at doing the own street in the next 12 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some funding and we 'll start doing some work [Music] through our w4q projects and that 's something that we 'll deliver over the next couple of years over the three years is something that we 'll continue to walk on uh in tully uh we are continuing our commitment uh particularly we have affected in some money for murray street road sorry murray street is what we affected in over two years uh and part of that is also uh it 's a key road to our caravan park and also um there is something that has been fitted in for renewal uh councillors are waste um we have obviously factored in uh some money for our mission beach transfer station upgrade so there 's about nine hundred thousand thousand dollars for that and um as i mentioned before we are looking at uh investing in the storage hill landfill by doing a side lift to manage waste going forward in terms of water a total budget of six million dollars which also includes us commencing on some design work for the hyde street reservoir and going forward trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued investment in our smart water meter programs so that sort of gives us a very high level summary of our operational budget our capital budget in councils with those i just wanted to touch on the last item the last item which is associated with the other resolution is on page just on page 154 so on page 154 one of the things i wanted to touched on is the uh department of local government and the queensland audit office uh measures us on our financial sustainability and the measures are the three ratios so the phase ratio is our operating surplus ratio uh so in terms of uh where we are uh with our anticipated forecast for this year we are we are we are not going to meet that ratio is what we are forecasting again that may change in the next couple of months uh but at this point in time we are forecasting not to miss it uh going forward into the next 10 years uh we are forecasting that we 'll meet that ratio over the next 10 years so that 's why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio fall between the target band going forward so that 's something we are hoping to achieve in terms of the next ratio which is our net financial asset and liability ratio so the target is 60 uh for this year we will meet that ratio so we are targeting 34.5 percent um and generally i think from where we said we will definitely meet that ratio so there 's no issues with that and then going forward into the future years we 're saying yes we will meet that ratio as well so that 's where we are forecasting oh yes to the next 10 years the last ratio counselors is our asset rate sustainability ratio so this is where the target is 90 percent so generally the expectation is we 'll invest 90 percent of our renewals or depreciation into renewals and what we are forecasting for this year at this point in time is that we will meet that ratio so if we look at the current financial year we 're saying we 're going to meet two of the three ratios apart from one going forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the asset sustainability ratio we are saying for next year yes we are hoping to meet that so that 's 93.7 the year after yes we will meet that at 112 percent uh but then you 'll probably see there 's a couple of years in between where we are not meeting it and it 's close to uh it 's between 80 to 90 uh dropping off in june 29 to below 80 percent uh but that 's a a reflection of the need to go back and look at our asset management plans because when we built our asset management plans two years ago um at that point in time our depreciation was around twenty 26.3 million from memory uh where we are now is around 28. uh but what we need to do is sort of get in the process of actually reviewing them on a animal basis so that then we can predict and forecast more accurate figures but again that 's that 's a reflection of us and the need to go back and look at our amps but again from a from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of forecasting is a a future that is sustainable for council going forward so that 's that 's in the long term plans uh and then underneath on the same page council so appendix k appendix k is the total value of change in our rates and utility charges uh and what we have brought into the budget process is we are actually comparing our movements over the last two over um over the last 12 months and we compared against two figures so when we look at the variance so the face variance is a comparison against our estimated figures that we had sort of forecasted for the end of this year so when we look at our 2021 budget versus our [Music] sorry it should be 20 21 22 budget versus our estimate uh what we 're saying is general rate has gone up by every general rate has gone up by 1.98 so that 's us using our estimated figures and the change in utility and charges utilities and charges is around 2.13 and then once we take off the discount the overall movement on net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.39 so that 's using our estimated figures and then at the same time when we compare our 21 22 figures versus our 2021 and this is our budgeted figures so there 's a difference between our budget and the estimated figures so we 've we 've increased or changed our estimate so when we compare that against our budgeted figures uh you can see the general rates are actually the average general rates actually forecasted to increase by point five one percent but that 's us purely comparing the budget figures uh but in the actual mod modeling uh what we have said is the general rates are going to go up by 1.98 for the 21 categories apart from one where it 's going up by 2.5 percent so so just to avoid any confusion so that 's where we 're saying that 's the number 1.98 plus 2.5 for the industrial category in terms of the util utilities and charges the the figure there is a percentage change of 3.49 percent um and why that figure is a bit distorted is because of our serious second pedestal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred thousand dollars and we 're going to give it back to our ratepayers and then throughout the year not every ratepayer has taken advantage of that so what has happened then is our estimated figures actually excluding the figure that hasn 't been taken up by by people so that 's why it 's distorting the numbers a little bit so overall um they are the two numbers that we are going to sort of look at and there will be a recommendation around the rates and utility charges and for that particular recommendation the figures that we are using is actually the figure which is the second figure which is 2.4 percent and 2.48 so that 's what the legislation requires us to adopt the budget on but the estimated figures gives us a more realistic figure of what we have done through the budget process so it gives us a greater greater clarity of okay what are the actual increases in movements um happy to take questions and if there 's any confusion thank you mr singh um we 'll go to the first budget resolution 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would somebody move budget resolution 14 the 2021 2022 financial statements moved by councillor bynes seconded by councillor tui all in favor carried unanimously thank you uh budget resolution 15 the 2021 2022 budget uh any questions mr singh no who will move that one council chewie mood councillor barnes second all in favor carried unanimously thank you budget budget resolution 16 changes in rates and utility charges any questions for mr singh no uh moved by councillor millwood second to boy councillor pervin all in favor carried unanimously thank you now we move on to the final budget resolution 17 the community financial report mr singh mr bradley thank you before i take you through this report i 'd just like to also pass on my appreciation to all staff involved in the budget process and the effort put in as well as counsellors and all of the effort throughout our numerous budget workshops um that you will put up with finance for a significant amount of time um and also pass on my appreciation to the management accounting team who put a substantial amount of effort and continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this council meeting being brought forward uh from the planned last week so i wanted to pass on that appreciation our community financial report is one of my favorite parts of the budget process so this provides our community and councillors with an informative and understandable way um to enable easy evaluation of our budget papers so the graphs which we 've used widely throughout this provide visual presentation of data and key financial statistics and so council 's budget comprises of two elements we 've got our operating budget and our capital budget the annual operating budget takes into consideration the needs of community and ensures that council has adequate revenue to provide those levels of service council maintains and manages infrastructure assets that are largely unique to the public sector including communities water sewage and waste infrastructure network of roads bridges drainage marine footpaths parks foreshores camping grounds sports grounds showgrounds and community halls it operates library and visitor information centres across the region providing planning services and supports community sports and cultural programs council provides for these extensive and diverse range of services primarily by utilizing revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2122 budget as we 've spoken about delivers a small operating surplus of twelve thousand dollars the capital budget provides for investment in community infrastructure to service our region with a 10-year long-term financial plan designed to accommodate the needs of the community into the future community assets cover categories such as those that i mentioned with land and buildings plant and equipment roads water storage and waste infrastructure continuing to invest in community assets the 2122 budget delivers a capital works program of 35.4 million council has focused on continuing to achieve efficiencies and reducing our operating costs whilst maintaining a level of service that meets our community 's expectations and this has been achieved by including asset rationalization targets reviewing the way council ensures its assets and reducing the number of operating initiatives in the 2021 financial year taking these factors into consideration councils determine a minimal increase to the level of rates with the general rate increase being 1.98 for the 21-22 financial year so this particular report um takes you through each aspect of our budget as well as the financial statements and explains um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned it also provides a table on page 159 in relation to council services and the operating and capital expenditure associated with those goes into detail on our operating revenue and with 82.26 reliance on net general rates and 9.2 on grants operating expenditure split as well as our capital works program and the 10-year capital forecast gives a bit more information around our financial position changes in equity and cash flow so it 's a little bit easier to understand as well as council 's financial sustainability ratios it also pulls apart our rates revenue with 53.48 of our general rates being residential and then our 10-year forecast for cpi over the long term in addition to that it provides on the last pages 168 and 169 the rates and charges comparative which isolates each majority sections of our community with a comparison for what their general rates and utility charges were last year in compared to what they are in the current year budget um unless there 's any further questions i 'm happy to take on this particular item thank you miss bradley any questions for miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community financial report councillor baines uh seconded by council millwood all in favor carried unanimously thank you that brings us to the close of the budget resolutions but before we do close the budget meeting uh i 'd just like to make a couple of comments and i will invite all councillors to do likewise straight after so firstly i 'd just like to acknowledge the great job done by our staff in my budget speech i mentioned about extreme unprecedented times and the unprecedented times are centered around historically low interest rates have an impact on our budget of around a million dollars uh insurance costs have gone up 10 uh so to to come up with an end result of a 12 000 surplus i think our staff have done an outstanding job uh i want to acknowledge the community engagement panel who 've worked closely with our staff in terms of asset rationalisation a key strategy that we 've adopted i 'd also like to acknowledge the rate referencing group who have made many recommendations there have actually been two rate referencing groups there was one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're down to about the last recommendation from this group so i want to acknowledge publicly the efforts of those people um i 'd also like to uh pay tribute to our ceo james got uh he has been with council for five years uh he uh will be watching next year 's budget via live stream i 've got no doubt and there probably some comments on social media about it he 's learning a bit of that tech savvy stuff i 've been told but i just want to say thank you to james because you steered us through several organizational restructures always painful always difficult but we saw the fruit of that last year where we were able to find nine hundred thousand dollars in savings and we had a budget that had an eight thousand dollar surplus so when you put that into context that 's how critical it was um you 've steered us through a pandemic and our staff i know have worked from home we 've had to close our chambers at times we 've had to restrict public access to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can look back and say i steered a team of 340 staff through a pandemic so that will reflect well on your cv mr ceo so and to the new ceo whoever it may be you are leaving a great legacy 13 unmodified audits debt-free a council that 's committed to addressing our biggest financial challenge our huge asset base our previous councils didn 't have the strength or the courage to do it it 's not popular and we 'll probably get punished in 2024. it 's so be it we 're all ratepayers and we know it 's the right thing to do and uh you 've overseen that process as well something that other councils are observing from afar and certainly taking notes about how we 're going about it and i 've had that feedback uh they 're watching closely how we 're monitoring and implementing our asset rationalization process so uncharted waters in that regard as well um a couple of other things i 'm proud of the fact that with a twelve thousand dollar surplus we still looked after our pensioners even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 in this budget um but when you benchmark the pension of concession with all our neighbouring councils we are the most generous in that regard so our social justice values are just as important as our core business and i 'm very proud of the pensioner concession um i note depreciation sits at 28.3 million this year and it goes over 30 million in two years time hence the urgent need to be aggressive with our asset base uh mr singh mentioned before uh the asset value per raidable property in our area around 74 000 and when we get compared with ingham and tablelands uh they 're around forty two thousand and forty four thousand so uh the the need for uh that restraint in terms of uh strategic decisions we 've made this year i i think a very good decision to take over waste on august one uh it comes with its challenges and we 've seen that in the employee costs in this year 's budget to our engineering section the money we 've spent on our water reservoirs no more boil water alerts third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under your management so i thank you for that um look i think i 've said enough and i want to leave some comments to my fellow councillors in regard to the great job our team have done in delivering this budget and the tremendous job uh james god has done uh as our ceo uh managing us through these really uh turbulent times over to any other councillor you 're not a counselor mr good i know i 'm mr mayor i 'd just like to uh compliment you on your summary i don 't think i 've got any more to say but yeah i support every word you 've just said and i 'd just like everyone to put their hands together for your words and also all the staff [Applause] councilor milward through the chair yes i also agree with everything that was said and yes we have had to make some very harsh decisions through this budget um and i 'd also like to commend all the teams the finance team my fellow councillors because we will wear that but we were brave and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you council millwood councillor pervin i too mr mayor i 'd like to thank your kind words there and also like to thank my fellow counsellors for the hours upon hours we put into getting this budget over the line um we will wear some pain but long-term gain for some short-term pain very well said counselor chewie yeah i agree with everything you 've said mr mayor um it has budgets are always daunting i think as a new counselor it 's probably one of the scariest things that you have to deal with and i take my hat off to the to the finance team because as i 've said before anybody that gets excited about numbers just baffles me and completely so i congratulate them and all all the ex directors and their teams and our fellow councillors and a thank you to mr god who has guided me personally through some challenging parts of my um moments that i 've decisions and conversations that i 've had so thank you to everybody involved and onwards and upwards we go thank you councillor chewie councillor barnes thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without me saying something so again i i do reiterate all your comments and your sentiments towards the staff the community groups our fellow councillors you know i 've been in this team now for five years and i 've seen many changes and people aren 't very comfortable with change a lot of the times but i know that the council laws the executive management team members and i believe the entire organisation is is better for the changes that we have made and the things that we are putting in place it 's been a couple of comments around the table about the pain we 're going to wear today i mean again this is one of the smallest rates and fees and charges increases in probably 10 years that this organisation has been in place and there 's many many sensible people within our community who understand what we 're doing and where we 're going and they really live by the adage one coast caspari coast and i think we 've brought a budget down today that is just absolutely epitomizing that new catch cry or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a new mindset within our region i think we need to continue it so congratulations to everybody thank you councillor baines council morgan sorry through the chair i also would like to acknowledge the many hours put in by the community consultative group and the rating reference group because they are our eyes and ears from the outside and they need to be commended on the work that they do thanks thank you fellow councilman before i hand over to mr god who 's chafing at the bid for right of reply um i just want to put it in these dollar terms last year we were being sworn in i think mr councillor barnes was the only certain winner and the rest of us were going through a painful process of preference counting we hit easter there was another delay and what was happening all the time staff were doing the budget they did all the hard yards for us we were fortunate we walked in there was a package there slight adjustments but the real measure is this year when we were able to be around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar surplus they could only deliver an eight thousand dollar service i was just gonna leave it at that and hand over through you mr chairman uh and seldom am i short of words one of my many failings but on this occasion i am short of words your comments in respect of me were too kind and i 'm deeply touched and humbled together with the words of the councillors uh i thank you and i thank you for your leadership um the um the words in respect of council 's other staff though uh were entirely appropriate and well deserved i salute the council and and i salute you mr mayor and again i 'm finding it very difficult to to find the words to to thank you because uh your comments really were unexpected and and too kind but thank you nevertheless well perhaps i rather would have deserved something in the invective or the pejorative thank you if there 's no further comments i 'll declare the budget meeting closed at 10 40. thanks everybody and we have another meeting at in 20 minutes time yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we finished daniel [Music] hi [Music] huh [Music] you,"(-17.5227345, 146.0278075)"

normalization of port hinchenbrook do we have confirmation on all the funding from the state and federal federal government and have we any indication of the additional 1.9 which was requested with the funding i 'll refer to the ceo through the chair thanks for the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh the state funding agreement so that funding agreement uh is is back with uh with the state to make some final amendments following a meeting this week and we 'd hope to have that back with council for execution next week so that 's the 6.3 million dollars from the state uh we 've had uh correspondence this week again with the federal government uh in relation to the funding for the dredging of one mile creek that emergency dredging funding of 1.5 so we hope to have that draft agreement um in the next week or so to start doing a review and some final negotiations and we have followed up with the with the the federal government also on the draft agreement for the six million dollars so we haven 't seen the draft yet uh but we are working with the federal government to receive that okay so as you just quoted then in the recommendation there 's a statement about emergency dredging one more creek can you please explain what that actually means by emergency dredging emergency dredging is really focusing on making that uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a maintenance dredging agreement it 's not funding for ongoing maintenance of that that channel it 's to open up that channel and make it navigable again okay and at item 9.1 there was a petition for a walking track to alligators in relation to the petition for the walking track has council proceeded with an application for the relative funding funding through the walking uh local government grants program i 'll have to take that question on notice and i 'll provide an administrative response i 'm not aware and i don 't believe the office is here today to answer that okay item 10.3 i 'd like to take this opportunity to thank you mr graffen for seeing to the removal of the car on jack drive which i have banged on about since the day i got here and i thank you and the people who were responsible for that that was great um item 10.15 uh the wayfinding signs being repaired do we have any line of sight to that there 's a contractual issue with the way finding signs at the moment so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been in contact with the contractors and those signs are currently still in their defects liability period so the repairs are a requirement for those contractors to to undertake and we are waiting for a response from the contractors but there has been significant correspondence backwards and forwards in relation to particularly getting the lights and the inner fail signs working and our delivery team in our asset maintenance is looking at ongoing maintenance program for those signs once we 're out of that defects liability period no problem and the last one is item 10.18 is there a new contract to be sought for the after hours number yes uh the council is considering an item today that puts a a focus back into that community area we have been under resourced in that area for some time but that will be a direct focus to go to tender and to to have a contract in place for that after hours line thank you thank you council millwood any further business horizon if not we 'll move on to um item three receipt of minutes 3.1 page 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the chair i 'll be uh today okay item 3.1 is is just uh presenting the the minutes from the cassowary coast regional council audit committee meeting so the audit committee meets quarterly each financial year to review matters relating to the operational risks and control measures detailed in its internal audit plan as required by the local government regulations 2012. so the minutes of the meeting contain a summary of matters which were discussed and are provided for council 's information so the minutes are attached to the item and there 's a recommendation there that the unconfirmed minutes which include relevant matters discussed at the cassiary coast regional council audit committee meeting held on thursday the 2nd of december 21 be noted thank you mr graff and any questions for the officer moved by councillor maine second by councillor chewie all in favor it 's carried unanimously thank you uh we move on to item four governance environment and finance item 4.1 paid 39 finance report and uh mr smith was going to present this report are you kidding no nobody here the only is coming i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for your report mate is it miss coppin radley sorry that 's her maiden name it certainly isn 't it good morning mayor and councillors today i 'm presenting the um finance report for the 31st of december the following are some key highlights our operational revenue is 47.4 million which is currently over budget in comparison to a budget of 46.8 million our operational expenditure is 47.4 which is which is 1.3 million under budget in comparison to our 248.7 the end of month cash balance is 42 million dollars our capital expenditure for the month was 5.2 million and the year today capital expenditure including commitments totals 26.8 million some key points tonight in reference to the budget variance is our interest is under budget from predominantly relating to interest investments and some under budget rates um interest operating grants is over budget due to the receipt of dfra emergent works funding from the 2021 events offset by grants under budget due to fire risk project and the cardinal mountain bike project not yet commenced other revenue ser sources are over budget mainly due to cost recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delivery of our late delivery of our new waste plant employee expenses are under budget due to vacant positions which is offset by our increased contract labor materials and services are under budget due to our reduced fleet expense expenditure insurance savings reduce marketing expenditure and reduce contract expenditure depreciation is currently tracking under budget due to minimal capitalization council officer officers are currently working diligently on this process to get these capitalizations up and running internal expenditure is under budget due to delay once again the delay of our delivery of our new waste plans and capital grants are under budget due to the dfra grant for upper daraji road not yet received this is offset by our claims for cali beach road culverts and barbed wire creek bridge with budgets to be rephased in the december review any questions thank you any questions for the officer if not with somebody move the recommendation please move by councillor mcleod second to buy councillor bones all in favor carried unanimously thank you we move on to item 4.2 page 53 organizational structure community customer experience and mr graffen will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified customer service as a key focus in 2016 and included a goal of community first in its corporate plan 2017-22 and this theme has continued in council strategic plan 2125 as goal number one community our people council has been on this journey of improved customer experience and satisfaction since 2016 and acknowledged customer experience as a whole of organisation focus and not a department within an organization today levels of customer satisfaction have not changed materially therefore this report proposes to amend the organisational structure to have the manager of customer experience and department report directly to the chief executive officer the role will have a functional relationship with all other delivery departments however delivery departments will retain responsibility for the outcomes in their service in background council are required by resolution to adopt an organisational structure and that organizational structure is a hierarchy by which council 's administration is divided into directorates departments and the different work areas and provides effectively a chain of command this this change is is really a focus on providing that customer first focus this is about us looking at our customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't seen that material change and this focus is about providing that broader focus across our organization and putting our customers first we have the technology now that 's been implemented through the customer first project in tech one that manages over 12 000 annual customer requests uh but improving then supporting that technology was only one component and this solution to excellent customer service depends on as much as supporting technology as it does with following the right processes and acting out the most appropriate behaviors and the organization has not yet addressed how to transform this process and behaviours to deliver that excellent customer service this proposed adjustment uh is is has been looked at and consultation has been undertaken both with the unions and with the affected employees but it 's important to say that this uh organizational restructure is around reporting lines and around changing uh the perception of a customer experience role it 's uh it 's not around looking at organizational savings it 's not around redundancies there are no changes in those spaces due to this proposal the uh the proposal does result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll see the communications team move and report um to the customer experience manager and not the government 's lead and that 's a more classical approach where the team that are communicating out and improving our customer experience also have that arm which is our comms arm that 's actually putting our communications externally and internally within the organization working as one team um we 'll also seek to have the information and records team so our records team move and sit under our governance lead and not the manager of information services so again uh having our governance through rtis and our our records team working together hopefully we are getting information back to the community uh in a more streamlined fashion i also looked at the the library team which uh had previously sat underneath the customer experience manager and looking to to move that team to report underneath the manager of community relations and services so the library team whilst providing excellent customer experience they are a community service and and one where those synergies between our library team and our manager of community relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed is around our housing and community centres coordinator reporting of our facilities asset manager not the manager of community relations and services and that 's around the the volume and quantum of properties that we have in that area and the requirement for proper and best asset management practices in those properties so working with our facility asset manager looking at asset management for those properties and also providing greater support for capital renewal and capital works on those properties as well whilst that coordinator still providing that focus on the individuals and the families that um that are provided accommodation through that scheme there is a recommendation there and the recommendation is to note the adjustments of reporting lines as detailed within the report and the report recommendation provides a new uh structure that 's proposed for adoption by council which as the report highlights is that customer experience area sit directly under the chief executive officer with the coms team sitting underneath that that manager that other change that can be seen in the proposed structure is for the records team to sit underneath the governance lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not becoming a part of the executive management team uh it is a reporting line direct to the ceo to ensure that that service is a focus across our whole organisation if there any questions i 'm happy to take them thank you mr graffen clearly this is a an adjustment to the chain of command there 's no remuneration changes and most importantly from my experience if we 're going to improve customer service we need the new people that you 've highlighted in your report to look at the emergency number that 's the number one area of complaint people are sick of getting on the phone a broken water main broken sewage and they hear music for 30 minutes i think that 's the key outcome from the new offices and the new structure council milwaukee yeah through the chair so just confirming that all the staff involved have been consulted and are happy with the restructure and understand the changes in full correct yes uh covert has obviously meant that we 've had to look outside the box with some of that consultation so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals that that are impacted we 've recorded those those meetings and that that engagement with those staff we 've undertaken an impact statement which has looked at the impact but as we said there are no major impact on staff in the sense that they will be working from the same seat they will be undertaking the same duties in the same team but just those change of reporting lines which in our mind provides some better synergies for the organization so when you say the same seat you mean that they can work from their same location that they 're currently at is that what that means they they would still be working from their same location um i 'll preface that with the fact that covert at the moment we do have a number of staff currently working from home or working in alternate areas to uh to reduce our density thank you councilman any further questions for the officer uh councillor baines um thank you mr chair i think it 's more a reiteration piece with the general public this is not about creating new positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting roles and trying to get um the teams working together more efficiently is that probably it in a nutshell that 's that 's absolutely it yeah excellent thank you councillor baines further to that i would oh sorry i just would like to uh through the chair support the recommendation i think it 's a great move it 's a much better flow than we not that we you know it wasn 't bad before but i think this will improve it uh so i think it 's a great move thank you thank you council chewie moved by councillor bone second by council jewelry all in favor carried inanimacy thank you we move on to item five asset sustainability 5.1 page 58 the water section and this report will be presented by mr page is this his first report it might be excuse me mr page i think this is your first report in your new role so welcome on board and uh hope you enjoy the journey with uh casper coach regional council thank you mr mayor good morning morning councillors mr ceo i take it uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read through the executive summary of this report so council is a registered water service provider under the water safety safety reliability act and one of its uh legislative obligations is to provide an annual performance report on a number of indicators nominated by the department of regional development manufacturing and water who are the regulator in this case the data required by the regulator covers details such as connected populations asset information water treatment sewage treatment staff information within those areas as along with system performance customer service and financial data the water and sewage data required by the regulator was loaded into the statewide water information management portal which is known as swim portal to meet the 17th december 2021 lodgement date in addition to the lodgement of data into this portal council must also publicly publish its performance and commentary on key indicators the cassowary coast regional council water and sewage service performance report for 20 20 21 satisfies council 's requirements under section 142a of the water supply safety and reliability act to prepare a performance report on water and search services for the 20 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overview of the extent of council 's water and sewage schemes followed by discussion on results of some of the key performance indicators for water services and sewage services lodged in the swim system the data lodged in the swim system is included in the report in addition to reporting in swim data the performance report also includes an overview of council 's adopted customer service standards and our performance against these standards as well as an overview on council 's drinking water services measured against the requirements of its approved drinking water quality management plan the performance report assists the regulator to determine whether the approved drinking water quality management plan and any approval conditions have been complied with and provides a mechanism for providers to report publicly on their performance in mentioning drinking water quality there 's two recommendations the first that uh council notes that the cassowary coast regional council ward and sewage services performance report for that 20 20 21 and also note that this report has been forwarded to the regulator as discussed above and has been published on council 's website the second recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main breaks has not been achieved for this financial year and request the chief executive officer considers this in preparation for the upcoming budget thank you mr page i 'll just make a comment about the second part of the recommendation you 've asked the ceo to consider preparation in the budget to look at the area where we 've fallen short in terms of water breaks could i also request that you consider some extra funding in the budget to allow some multi-skilling we 've got some really good people in that section who like to multi-skill and if you could give them an opportunity to do restricted licenses it allows a laborer to work their way up the career path it 's it 's good for morale it 's good for our organization in terms of broadening our skills in that water section and i 'm sure as a manager it 'll help you deliver because the last thing we want is to run short on plumbers uh and have to contract everything out so i ask that you consider that in your budget request to the ceo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for that council norwood through the chair mr page i also noted a recommendation too that we have not achieved the level of service so do we have a plan in place which on the label which will then enable the required level of service to be achieved yeah we have a well with all our uh key performance indicators and level of service information we have um gathered over the past we look at a number of those areas which we have not met or achieved our required level of service and with that it obviously we look at whether it 's a operational or capital investment is required so we are increasing our capital works and looking at those levels of service obviously for main breaks and so forth we undertake a lot of um internal reviews on those areas and those areas where we do see a level of service decreasing they go in to be put up for their next capital works in the next financial year no worries and also noted that um tully has got the most of the main breakages and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for money in the budget to um [Music] suffice fixing the largest number of main breakages within the region which are in tully yes uh we 've already undertaken a lot of ford design works in for the tully region for water main replacement so that for design work will lead into next year 's capture works for a for actually our install of new pop work in that area and we again so if we 've done a number of uh preemptive works already and so we are looking at increasing the rollout of our capital works in the tully scheme to look at these areas of of a number of breaks because you you are uh correct in the fact that tully has had the largest number of breaks um in the la in this reporting period so we are looking at ways to start to diminish those breaks thank you thank you council millwood councillor pervin uh morning mr page just a quick one in relation to the water main renewals how are we tracking for this for uh this this financial year 's budget in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the budget are we on track or are we running behind we 're i 'd say we 're just a little bit behind at the moment something and obviously it 's um we 've had a number of factors that impacted on that something um the biggest ones being code and just getting that workforce out into the into that capital area we 've had um trouble in recruiting some uh plumbers as well so obviously that 's been raised earlier in relation to the upskilling so with um so to answer your question we are a little bit behind but we are putting more focus into that area over the preceding month to pick that up again all right thanks mr page thank you councillor pervin any further questions for the officer if not would somebody move the recommendation moved by councillor pervin seconded by councillor mcleod all in favor carried unanimously thank you move on to item 5.2 page 65 asset rationalisation process lease report tully support centre and mr mcbride will present this report morning councillors morning ceo good morning morning mr mcbride uh presenting two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the cassowary coast uh the first one refers to the tully support center by way of background well the local government regulations allow for a disposal to a community organization without going to public tender or auction provided there is a prior council resolution so these reports both seek to get a resolution from council prior to entering into a lease by a background the site refers to 54 bryant street in tully which is the whole of the lot the organization is the tully support center the tully support center have been occupying the existing site nearly 30 years and have been maintaining all the improvements on the on the land

report authoriser chief executive officer to execute the lease on behalf of council as the lease or and authorise the chief executive officer to ensure ongoing compliance with all terms and conditions of the lease thank you mr mcbride council milward be sick to me by the end of the day good morning mr mcbride um oh this is more just the support for the actual recommendation the tully support center has played a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families and has done so for many years so to see this lease extension is a great demonstration of council 's commitment to recognize and support the partnership for the greater of the community benefits so i 'd like to make the recommendation be accepted moved by councilman millwood seconded by councillor pervin uh i 'd just like to go to the um the background

working in partnership with the community to enhance and promote pride in and livability of the region there 's no doubt tully support centre is a star in this area in an integral part of our social fabric so i have no hesitation in reporting supporting the report either we have a move and a seconder any further comments counsellors all in favor carried unanimously thank you uh we move on to item 5.3 page 68 asset rationalization process lease report tully bow hunters club mr mcbride thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of this uh this paper is to uh seek council 's resolution prior to entering into release with the tully bow hunters by way of background the premises that the bow hunters occupy is tully gorge road in tully um the tully bowhunters club have been established since 1977 and have occupied this this site since 2004. the club caters for bowhunters and archers generally it allows schools and other clubs to use the site in facilities at no cost uh the club has reclaimed the old quarry and carried out extensive rehabilitation and landscaping of the site and constructed their own facilities and all the improvements on the land are owned by the uh the leasing uh the club is in proved to be entirely self-sufficient with its own power supply and amenities and subsequently uh in line with council 's adopted principles we 're seeking to allow the taliban hunters to enter into a new lease in line with the following terms and conditions the site as discussed is tully gorge road tully the term of the agreement is 10 years from the first of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a peppercorn arrangement which is one dollar per annum outgoings rates and charges uh the responsibility of the leasee and all improvements on the land uh under the ownership of the leasee as well and the permitted use is bow hunters and archery club and ancillary purposes um we have just in line with this process uh officers have gone through and looked at the governance insurance financial reports of the user group and they 've certainly demonstrated to officers that they 're deserving of a of a new 10-year lease and we 're happy to support that and put that recommendation forward to council thank you mr mcbride uh council mains barnes good thank you mr may i 'd like to support this lease i know that this committee a very hard-working committee has been waiting for this lease for a very long time as they have appetite not only for the state championships but also for the national championships in i think that could be coming up within a couple of years so this is very crucial thank you thank you council barnes council milwaukee yes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-standing bowhunters club is another great community-minded group with self-initiative and a great track record they have a beautiful facility out there i know people have been out there and actually got married and had all sorts of functions out there that they 've hired the facility for so yeah no i 'm fully supported and i would like to move that we go with the recommendation moved by council millwood oh sorry uh you want to speak councillor bones yes if i may thank you mr chair i really love the idea about not a shotgun wedding about a crossbow wedding that 's that 's really quite interesting um just one question uh peter the last lease was 30 years this lease is significantly shorter being a 10-year lease do they have an option to um is there an options phase at the end of this or because sometimes china especially if they 're not just going for government money if they 're trying to borrow money 10 years can be quite a short tenure that they may not be able to qualify so uh ten years would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the discussions with the le c uh i believe and i 've been working with my colleague there as well but okay that was part of the discussion uh where at the end of that 10-year period they 're welcome to apply for a new lease or during the term if they 're seeking a funding agreement which uh requires a longer term a tenure council can look at that in due course okay sorry in three years the second part we can still look at that under section 236 uh anyway as the at any time council can 't surrender and enter into a new lease with the support of council yeah thank you thank you councilman we have a mover a second please seconded by councillor baines i like to go to the corporate plan again and just highlight why we 're going to support this recommendation again council working in partnership with the community to

section of the ranch road cardi road deco path and duncan lane drainage renewal just a little on risk management we 've obviously got the weather risks at the moment can have the obvious impacts on on delivery of these projects and i guess covert is is certainly starting to impact us on our day-to-day runnings and and um within our um capital program as well so i 'd like to recommend that the council receive the report and acknowledge the status of the capital works projects managed by it thank you mr slattery question council millwood through the chair good morning mr slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we mentioned murray street project can you please elaborate on the works planned for murray street and when the project may start and how long it may take okay there 's two two projects in murray street through the chair apologies um one is for a culvert renewal culvert 10 that 's a little way down murray street i think adjacent to bynum street and there 's also the one between curtis and richardson street if you can clarify that yeah that 's the one okay so that one there is is still in the design phase at the moment um in terms of timing it 's quite a difficult answer to provide right now because we um it 's still in design phase of course and and um we need to place orders for for culverts and until we know what the design looks like we are unable to do that and currently there are long lead times for those culverts so it is a i guess a dry season job i 'd like to say that we would start that in this financial year towards the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may june but really does depend on on the delivery of those culverts once we we place an order for those do we need more funding for this project or is it fully funded at the minute i 'd take that on notice if i could yeah i can 't answer that one okay and the other one was um on page five the tully rv parking i was just wondering when we would see the line marking and the rv signage erected yeah okay so with with the line marking there 's quite a few projects um open at the moment that require line marking so what we want to do there is is we don 't do that internally we always contract line marking out so we want to package up a few of those projects and deliver those through a through a contract or an external contractor one of those those projects is the the mission beach car park um it 's probably about a month away so when when that 's completed we 'll start there and then other other line marking jobs like the rv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few projects in cardwell as well and we 'll attack those all at the same time thank you councilman millwood council chewie good morning thank you uh through you mr mayor morning mr slattery just uh the mission beach car park is obviously close to completion there has been a lot of commentary to me and in social media about trees could we have some clarification on where trees i believe we have we are agreeing to trees being put in so if we could have some idea about where when and what type of tree if that 's at all possible thank you there 's obviously concern i 've actually parked in a car park at mission beach and had a tree fall on my windscreen because so that 's just something obviously that needs to be considered when we know we like shade but we need to be practical about the outcome as well thank you okay i 'll take part of that on notice um look there there is certainly a plan to put foliage and and potentially shrubbery in that car park um i can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those um but there 's certainly a planning in place for that um and that 'll happen soon after the completion of that car park we 'll start planning planning stuff there yeah thank you council chewie councillor barnes good thank you mr mayor mr slattery i heard you say earlier about design um being the head of your department your section are you finding that we 've hit a bottleneck with a lot of our design projects is that 's what 's holding some projects up or is it supply or is it staff certainly issues with staffing with with covert we 've had some impacts in the delivery of capital projects and our day-to-day maintenance program as well with staffing issues um i wouldn 't say that design specifically is is holding up the delivery of those projects no through through the chair i think council 's focus to actually allocate additional funding to design this year is allowing us to to really start to try and get ahead but i think it is probably a fair comment that historically um design based on the funding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up with our delivery teams but the additional funding this year and um you know some recent recruitment in that space is uh certainly starting to assist well thank you well said any further council bonds that 's it okay councillor bones thank you mr chair and i just wanted to run into a little bit more on the the question from councillor chewie and to brendan about vegetation we have two wonderful nurseries that a council run they 're very experienced in what endemic species uh need to be grown and what are specific to certain areas so i can assure you both that our team and the volunteers at our nurseries will make sure that the appropriate vegetation goes in place and hopefully you won 't end up with a tree branch on yours that 's okay we 've got some really really experienced crew in our nurseries and they know exactly what sort of trees to put in there so thank you council bones uh look i 'd like to supplement council chewie 's request for some greenery around the car park the car park is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the legacy project of this council um we 've spoken to bob catter and he also is requesting uh some upgrade in terms of the vegetation at that site and uh we did a walkthrough with anthony albanese lead the opposition recently made it very clear that this is our number one project and i think the car park can be the flagship to attract that state and federal funding uh shane knuth is also very supportive so let 's finish the car park off the way the community wants it and and also federal member mr carter has made a personal request to the ceo to see this happen are there any further comments or questions somebody moved the recommendation please move by council dewey seconded by councillor barnes all in favor carriage inanimacy thank you thank you mr slattery we move on to planning services item 6 6.1 page 83 delegation report and mr horton will present this report thanks council morning good morning council item 6.1 delegation report and current applications um as you 're fully aware we spoke last council meeting that we 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentation and detail to you but we 'll do that through another manner of um a dashboard and live data for yourselves to um be able to see that at all times the public 's able to see it at all times we have everything on the my council website up there people can see that as we do things in day to day in in the office um and what decisions we make around those applications so that is all there and and um we welcome the public to jump on board as well um overall council um for planning we had 26 approvals for the month of december so this is finishing december december off we had 2400 delegation and two at council overall we 're up for the six month period for our financial period we 're up 12 from last year 123 approvals there um council so far which is nice to see overall the dwelling approvals for the year um were 150 well above any of the past five year periods um i think the closest we had was 94 approvals in a year so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement and activity that we 've got in our region overall approvals we had 568 well above any of the past years as well which is nice to see overall council for the december month it drops away usually in december and january because people have the christmas break and go and leave but overall we had 35 approvals for 4.7 million dollars worth of estimated works for the month of december overall for the year council um total um figures for all approvals were 67.1 million um into our region and with housing was 43.2 million an estimated cost for the year so it 's a substantial amount of money that 's going into our area and as you can see there 's a number of subdivisions that come online and hopefully further applications into council to deal with that overall counsel the other one that i just wanted to provide was the records um as we know with our property searches building searches you know rate searches and so forth they 're well above any other time so we finished with 546 for the year so that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods um from years before where we had people come in and buy a lot of the land in mission beach um so it gives us great confidence to show that people are investing in our area and coming to the area and um you know sourcing um existing dwellings and hopefully um you know add to those with um upkeep and maintenance and um yeah we move forward as as an area which is nice to see any questions happy to answer any questions for the officer counselor chewie thank you mr hortons through the chair um great statistics and you know where we know that uh we 're booming just a question as far as livable sheds go is there a time frame and for people to be in a shed before they have to build their house through the chair um the way a livable shed works it is a class 10a dwell approval which is usually a non-residential type of um occupation for that shed we we do the temporary home permit usually for a 12-month period to allow those people to um occupy that usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling approval they start with that but they have to have a dwelling approval in place if they don 't have that they 're unlawfully occupying that building at that time so everyone sort of talks about a livable shed it 's either a dwelling or a shed there 's no livable component it 's one or the other thank you it 's just we know a lot of people are living in sheds uh on that their new property in in anticipation of building their house you know and then the shed will become a shed and not a dwelling so i just needed some clarification on that thank you councilman milward um yeah through the chair so just on the my council um bit is there a step to step guide that we can put out for the community to be able to follow to be able to have a look at all those um approvals that we do the chair we through the chair we can definitely look at that council yeah it 's a pretty simple format but um yeah we can provide as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have or any search that we send out um and we put that documentation at the bottom of our thing where the location is we put the link in the email to the to the customer as well so they can go directly there so yeah definitely we can look at fact sheets and those types of things to improve our um our items on the on our website any further questions for mr horton just a general comment mr horton aside from your report um the cairns posts are chasing a feedback from our planners in relation to why we support a review of the 2009-2031 regional plan we all know about the housing crisis we know about zoning restrictions so there 's some really good reason but fellow councillors if the cairns post contact yeah please don 't respond because we do need our officers to put some thought into this all the mayors in north queensland are calling for a review of the regional plan it 's restricting every area and a lot of the problems is around zoning so there will be an article very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr jones are compiling that response so just want to keep everybody in the loop on that uh mr horton can you make some summary of uh why the planners would like to see a review of the regional plan i 'm through the chair the regional plan you know is a document that was produced in 2008 2009 um at that time we went through the draft process and we and we got finalized in 2009 we had a lot of involvement with that at the time it 's a very environmental plan you know and the aspects around control with zonings and urban footprints and those types of things were really in place and that was because of the explosion in southeast queensland at the time moving around 0.607 and when that plan come out since then those plans have been redone and as you would know fully aware that north queensland one has just been you know was released as well you know they 're totally different plans they look at different um components and and economic development and drive around those areas and they explain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today have got a lot further commitments in them and put those commitments in place around infrastructure transport and look we we really need to review the components of the um regional plan it 's a very lower order and very prescriptive type of plan at the moment which then feeds into our planning scheme we needed to be at a higher level talking more strategically about the whole region and what the region expects to see moving forward you know on the commitments from the state on what they will deliver um and how we can work in with those guys to deliver what we need to especially around our port our rail networks our transport networks up to palmerston our linkages and how we link to table lands how we you know was linked with cairns with industrial those types of things and how that flows through our region so we really need to review and get that to a higher level and more more i suppose more around how do we drive this area with the change especially now we got covered in how we work you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and that 's what we 've got to look in the planning scheme but we 've got to have the changes to the regional plan to be able to make those changes in our planning scheme at the same time thanks for that very comprehensive report uh response mate any further questions for the office of counselor baits um thank you mr chairman and probably just a comment i mean dan and i think i 'm not speaking for you mr horton but i suppose um you probably see nowadays that a lot of the development applications that are coming forward in this day and age are very environmentally sustainable they 're very conscious of what 's going on organically the industry is growing into we need to be part of the environment and i can 't remember that term that was used at the conference mr graffen about negative or uh i can 't remember at the moment but you know the real push in the world is is to development can go on and be part of the environment and we you know we 're in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great barrier reef and that should not exclude responsible sustainable development from our area and this review of the regional plan will allow us to step into those spaces make sure all those protections are in place thank you council bones any further questions for the officer somebody move the report please move by councillor pervin second and by council millwood all in favor carried unanimously

councillor barnes all in favor carriage unanimously thank you that brings us up to item seven general business council milward through the chair yeah um i 've i 've been informed recently that the atherton rope road project has now been removed from our work schedule so i was just wondering if anybody could shine the light on where this funding would be diverted to uh through the chair i think mr slattery will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atherton road project was one project that sat inside a submission for a works for queensland package submission three as we know that project 's not going ahead in terms of the funding what we 're looking to do there is is we 've made an application to the department to try and get those funds redisbursed amongst other projects within that same submission so specifically i don 't know which ones they are right now but basically and we haven 't had a response from the department but that 's that 's what we 're looking to do i 'd like to make a request that we um that maybe the funding could be seek to be put into the revitalization of tully project um other than that uh we had scrap metal bailers that were supposed to come before christmas it 's been brought to my attention again that the bells creek facility has got mounds and mounds of white goods and scrap metals at the location i just wondered if there 's been any further advances because we actually paid those people to come twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff they haven 't haven 't come at all in the past 12 months so i 'm just wondering if this has been done and if not i 'll chase it up with um fnq rock over to you mr sadler drew the chair thank thank you councillor millwood for your question um in relation to bell 's creek i 'm understanding that the supervisor was there on tuesday i don 't have an update since that time so i 'll seek that update um there was issues with the bailout from the contract in relation to our scrap metal piles uh they were to be on site um at the beginning of this week and i 'll get an update for you directly and um and and get that outcome sorted for you thank you mr sadler one more query um was about i 've had several phone calls over the past week about the lack of slashing in the region um do we have any line of sight to what 's happening in that space mr sadler sure i 'll take that one too thank you council through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier on today um through some of the other reports we do have about a 25 reduction in our staff at the moment in relation to whether that 's annual leave sick leave or covert leave so we do have a backlog and i did update council on that at the end of last week we do have in relation to vegetation maintenance and grass cutting we do have a backlog there that we are i suppose keeping an eye on we are i suppose have a number of impacts on that we do have some vacancies in that space as well machinery is is ready to go we will look at any external support on that if it continues yes i was just going to suggest i know we don 't want to look to outside contractors but maybe for the short term it might be worth getting some on board to get everything back on top anyway through through the chair i think there 's a um a focus on level of service obviously uh the the reduced level of service probably from an aesthetic slashing point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are a safety concern and i guess if there are members of the community that have specific areas where they feel that that reduction in level of service due to the matters that mr sadler have highlighted are causing a safety concern would encourage them please to contact council and and those resources can again continue to be focused on those safety areas but uh do apologize we are impacted like most other organizations uh with what we 're experiencing at the moment and um it has meant that from an aesthetic point of view that uh we 're we 're not meeting that level of service that the public may be used to in some areas but safety is still a focus council bonds good thank you mr may just further on from the scrap metal mr saddler we pay those contractors to come but we must get revenue from the scrap because scrap is currently at an all-time high yes through the chair that is correct as part of the fnq rock contract that we are part of we do get revenue from from that work all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for councillor jeffrey or um adam yourself is the big eradication is is that with the last three or four weeks we 've seen a major influx of pigs in our shower especially in the farming area yeah i can step to that first mr sadler if you 're okay through here mr chair um the there 's a feral pig meeting on next week next tuesday third of feb which is the last one for the state run program we do have uh presentation and the attendance of the national coordinator for the national pig program attending look there was a hiatus over the christmas break period on baiting but the baiting program is up and running as of the 19th there 's a lot of growers and um in cane and bananas that are being part of it um we would like as a program um that as many of them coming forward and talking to us because if we can set up baiting clusters it makes it much easier upon all of the land holders if we can get a cluster of land holders in an area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of notification that has to go around because you 're only negotiating with the boundary holders around the outside of the cluster um council doesn 't do that work directly but we will assist in that sort of work so the baiting program is up and running it is still going again where we go in the future i mean the state funded program was very successful it ran for three years which uh has been very well supported i i i 'm not speaking ill of any government i love working with the state and the feds but three years isn 't long enough in a region like this to bed something like this in place so i would encourage the state or the federal government to help us continue because the model that we 've designed within the kashmir coast region is something that can be exported around the entire country and i think it needs to be they need to give us a hand and keep us going along so good thank you mr thank you councillor baines and as far as the mowing contract as i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there are two main green slashes in the southern section did have turbo issues and was covered there was a long wait for parts so we did employ contractors and we are currently still using them but as council millwood stated there is a big backlog and the growing conditions recently has just made it an endless task maybe a question for the ceo now we have a great facility in clump point now i know we gave a six month waiting period settling down period now i think that six months is up at the end of january now i know we have to put a lot of work into our local laws now to bed that down so we can get income now from all the leases on all those swing moorings um where are we standing there mr ceo uh through the chair yeah there has been a lot of work going to those local laws so those local laws are currently with the department uh full review so that review could take uh four to six weeks those local laws will then uh following review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department they 'll be brought to council as a draft and that will be seeking council to endorse those local laws to go out for public comment that public comment needs to be a minimum of 21 days and then those local laws will come back to council to be uh considered for adoption so uh it 's it 's in the process there 's uh some components at the moment that uh we 've got legislative requirements that uh dictate the uh the time frame and others that um are resourcing within the department to do that review but um from our side they 're currently sitting with the department and we 'll seek to have those for council consideration to go to public comment uh as soon as possible all right all right thank you well i 've got you was only it was only this week that i mentioned about the big problem that some of our neighbouring councils are having with hip camps affecting their local caravan parks and i 'm just hoping as a council that we soon do a study on our rb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're getting in from people who wish to start these hip camps now i know some councils rushed into it and now they 're regretting with the decisions they made so i hope that 's not us and the last question i think i 've got is um we had a tender out for the construction of the pump track in cardwell and i think that closed last week but i know we 're in hard times running this council we 've got two or three officers in isolation and i know even yourself so maybe you can 't answer that i 'll have to take that on notice unless mr sadler who 's in the room is able to provide an update on that but um we 'll take that on notice and come back to you but uh yes thanks councillor joey thank you through the chair i have several um bits and pieces um just a question for mr slattery is he still in the room thank you um i 've just i 've had several people ask me um regarding the playground equipment being returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the return of playground equipment of some degree to wheatley park um it 's looking weekly parts looking fantastic with the turf but people are wanting it to go back to an area that they can take their their children and families to so could you give us an update on both of those uh things please sure thank you for the question through the chair uh i 'll start with south mission so the the park set will be reinstalled there next week okay so um yeah we 've just been impacted with with manning a few trips down so yeah we 're back on that next week wheatley park yeah it does look great obviously we don 't have a place set back in there at present the one that was in there was close to end of life when we removed that it was damaged it can 't go back in so what we 've done is formed a working group with some officers from council and some external community groups we haven 't met yet but the plan is to meet with those and kick some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i guess flavor of the month or year if you like right now is nature place so we 're looking for options in that space um that will sort of target that same age group that the previous equipment thank you and we do we know i suppose we don 't know if netflix are coming back so obviously we need to take that into consideration should they come back and use that space and that we need to have something that can be taken in and out absolutely yep okay thank you mr slattery uh i don 't know this is mr jones mr horton ceo or the mayor i 'm just wondering how we 're going with the securing of funding for the master plan for mission beach uh you spoke earlier of it with mr albanese coming i know our team did a walk through uh recently perhaps mr jones or mr horton could provide some information on that with the landscapers i believe were there thank you mr slattery through the chair um the funding application of the current times being um prepared and finalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ february with the government at the moment we 're seeking um our letters as well external letters to support that we have a number of that from our previous application um we 're slowly going through that making sure that we 've got everything correlated everything ticked and the appropriate attachments done but yeah we 're looking well to um put him for that funding and keep our fingers crossed council that he comes to us so and i believe we had to make some changes from our last design so that 's obviously been taken into consideration was that what the walkthrough was i was unable to attend uh when mr albanese came is that what was considered in the walk through through the chair the walkthrough was mainly around detailed design and moving forward with a change in pavement and and those types of um subtle approach changes um you know removal maybe a bit of a concrete that was in the original design but um it 's around the drainage and and how that all fits together the levels um yeah and what type of furniture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same as what we had that 'll go at the current time because of the short time frame but we 'll continue to work with the community the public um and any changes there we 'll come back and consult as well we 'll we 'll get only appropriate communication plans and engagement plans around that so we can talk to a number of people and businesses and in the community again as we move forward with this project thank you mr horton um just a couple of other things um we all met yesterday at the shire hall for a great uh celebration of our nation we welcome our new citizens and we congratulate all the nominees and winners of our australia day awards um it was a great a number of people that did take the time to nominate an event or a person which is fantastic so i congratulate everybody involved i shout out to our staff miss hanson miss aglie and ms vitale for fine-tuning everything i think they did a great job so well done to them and finally i would just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call her miss smith because she was my teacher at tully high and she taught many people at tully high so a large member of the community will have fond memories of her at tully high but she was also a very passionate environmentalist and worked very hard in lots of different groups just some of which was the wildlife preservation society of queensland friends of nene rise the national mahogany glider recovery team um they 're just a few other things so yes i would just like to acknowledge her passing and send our condolences on behalf of council to her family and friends thank you thank you council chewie councillor millwood through the chair so this was probably back at you jeff about the pig baiting meeting um could you just clarify where and what time that meeting will be and who can actually attend there is a committee that has been set up and running for three years on this pig-baiting partnership those committee members are already engaged and included we 're not it won 't be open to the public i believe i think mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to that this is a conclusionary piece of the first program but i would suggest and mr sadler will pull me up if i take this too far but i know council wants to re-engage with many more uh growers i 've got a meeting myself with a couple of growers tomorrow i 've been having meetings with growers all the way through so i would suggest in the near future we might have a bit of a broader meeting with the local industry because it 's a very important piece of this is industry has got to be involved and work with us it 's not the state government 's job it 's not council 's job it 's everybody 's job and we all need to be part of it yeah i get that and i 'll just one more on that while we 're at it and while we 've got you there mr sadler is um can you please put something out in the media about the changes to the allocated baits and the requirements and the new restrictions that are involved now that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so through the chair on the first question councilman milward and just to support uh councillor baines there is an executive oversight group which has got industry leaders so both cane bananas it 's also got defence qpws council daf and a whole heap of others that come to that table so it is not an open meeting for everybody it 's there are industry leaders there so for those growers particularly banana cane or beef or cattle go to the industry leaders that do attend that and yes as councilor bain said that is a wrap up of the project that was externally funded however in saying that because there 's been some great relationships built from there and that this is a catchment based issue that it will continue to meet and work with industry in relation to where are the problems because pigs don 't know the difference between bananas cane or cattle they will go wherever they need to go and will want to go so we have to all come together to solve this issue in relation to your second question we have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been notified of the changes at the beginning of this year and how baiting will continue at this stage we are working with a number of the industry leaders on how we can do that better communication is definitely the key and yes there has been changes in relation to distribution of the 1080 poison through queens queensland health and we are making sure that we are compliant in relation to that council mains well probably and a little bit further with the debating program now it 's actually running under federal legislation it look it at face value it seems a little onerous and a little over the top but it 's not we 've discussed it at um f and q rock nemac level we 've discussed it at local level there is a a lot of simple methods that are being uh developed that we can take to land holders to make sure that it 's not onerous and and too hard for people to do and uh there is an education piece being put together that will be distributed through fnq rock um through the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in any of these pig meetings again we 've got to make it easy for people everyone to get involved and as i said if we all get involved in this and continue working together we 'll keep going forward with the amazing results we 've had over three years and if you 're talking to any of your state and federal politicians please encourage them to support us in getting this model refunded and building a model that we can export across queensland in its entirety and the whole nation thank you councilman any further general business uh councillor pervin yeah um just a couple of questions probably directed to mr sadler mr sadler i think either the previous meeting or the meeting the meeting before i asked about and it was taken on notice operating hours of the stoddas hill waste transfer station how are we going with that have you got some information back to us on that yet on um how we can extend that operating air of an afternoon sorry councillor um i don 't have the answer to that right now sorry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today we i do have a number of those staff still on leave at this stage so i will fire that up after this meeting for you yeah if you could appreciate that because i 've still got some members of the public and um in particular business members of the public ask me about that it 's just it 's really ripping into their business and they find it very difficult so if we could yeah get back to us as a council on a whole um also i just want to ask as you first come into innisfail from the south past the old high school where the set of stoplights are there um we 've got along that whole entryway to our town there it 's very it 's not it 's not clean um i know it 's main roads but who maintains that is that the council or main or main roads if you could let me know on that one i 'd appreciate that because it needs a big clean up and it is the very first thing when you see you come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all ripped up as the grass is long i just would love to see a cleanup if we 're not maintaining it can we please get main roads to pull their finger out and give it a bit of a clean for us well yeah i 'll follow that up for you councillor any further general business i just want to make two comments um one is about the poor attention dredging issue that we raised earlier um totally operational we know it 's sensitive negotiations but from a political point of view uh seven councillors are nervous about the federal election being called and caretaker mode coming into vogue and that could restrict the flow of that funding so we 're pretty nervous about our staff getting an agreement on that dredging before the federal elections call because a caretaker might just put that on a note supplement what counselor chewie said about the wonderful event yesterday uh if you add up the hundreds of years of volunteer work that those nominees put in it 's unbelievable and given that irene braddock was awarded 2022 citizens of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just read what they say describes a volunteer it 's not for money it 's not for fame it 's not for any personal gain it 's just for love of fellow man it 's just to send a helping hand it 's just to give a tilth of self that 's something you can 't buy with wealth it 's not medals one with pride it 's that feeling deep inside it 's that reward down in your heart it 's that feeling that you 've been a part of helping others far and near that 's what makes a volunteer i thought that was very well written and in terms of irene braddock our citizen a year that describes her perfectly if there 's no further general if there 's no further general business we 're now going to close the meeting to the public and the reasons for closing uh item 8.1 page 359 requests for legal assistance by the chief executive officer and that 's a report from myself and item 8.2 page 394 legal matters update and that 's a report
