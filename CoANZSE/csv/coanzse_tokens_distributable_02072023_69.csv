2020,m6E8WqIONjg,20200219,3338.34,"Serpentine-Jarrahdale, WA, Australia",8087,joining me in the in the neighborhood and certainly in the studio this morning for the first time in 2020 and my Christmas we have been really already pretty scary but I say very good morning and welcome to the president of the shy of 70 and Jared are very good morning to the s-type resident counselor at the show which good morning and the madam president good morning James I am so excited to be back you know I cannot believe we are already a month down it is just fly by it 's active life with so much I suppose that has taken and continues to take care of tension as far as the the obvious national disaster on the East Coast scary to think that that 's started back in in November and it was before November they had fire start in the eastern states probably going back as early as September last year which is you know realistically unprecedented the bush fires to start so early but we are seeing that our wish fire period is beginning to lengthen and because that is lengthening that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire brigades and that have to do mitigation very shortly so you know we we are seeing changes and humates that space eventually come back to all of us as to what we are doing about mother nature of the environment that outfit through were to try and reduce an impact on the the big picture the by way of subjects obviously that links in to the channel just having with my previous guest the president from the would be a state residents association as you were well known yourself there was a fire within that has been a capital within with inside this this bushfire season already fabulous if you say the work of the volunteers and they are fire brigades in getting on top of them and then without them having anywhere near the impact that they have done yeah well obviously we 've had numerous little fires all cost higher for months we 've had to I suppose significant events in recent weeks we had the bell divers Medela fire a couple of weeks ago which started in the city of Rockingham and spread quite quickly we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shy of 70 and jarred up our local volunteer fire brigades along with défis and Department of Parks what is the department of biodiversity or whatever it is dbca and numerous other different groups you know the the SES and they all work together and the job they did in the conditions are fighting that particular fire to stop it where they did and to only have a shed and rural fencing lost was unbelievable that the job they did was absolutely enormous then earlier this week or this week that 's just gone we 've had another significant event we had another fire that started out in Hope land again extremely grateful to our local Fire Brigades défis and all the other organizations that come in like the Salvos come in as well to feed and water and that all the people that are out there fighting the fire so it it 's it 's not a just a couple of people here in there this is a huge joint effort between a number of different large and small organizations that go into protection of our community as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land fire again no major assets lost it was contained to a bush land reserve so it was an extremely difficult fire to fight given the nature of where it was but again they managed to jump on top of that extremely quickly and contain it so that they could then control it and it eventually comes out to say from operational perspectives not just those that literally it 's all those and you know that the planning that goes on should in into those events to make sure that the people out there on the fire ground are safe and you know that the back work we have a number of Shire officers as well that continuously just working in the background and I don 't think people have a full understanding of the cooperation that goes on between various groups and departments to actually keep people and areas safe when these events arise yes and to the extent as you would be aware attended the meeting that is stage in itself is within the Shire one of attractions is the beautiful rural setting that they find themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oz it sometimes bush fires a in reality anytime look they are in our Shire alone we are 97% bushfire prone that is a fact I myself live on an O three Road completely surrounded by bush I know the risks I choose to live there in knowing those risks and choosing to live there I must have a bushfire plan and if that is as soon as you see smoke or you hear something you get out that 's what you do you have to plan for what is there at any given point in time you can 't plan for what should be because that 's not where you 're living you 're living in the here and now so you must plan for that and as things change your bushfire plan will also change but I think there is a lack of understanding and this is probably one of the spaces at the Shire was not that we the show will be working in this space because I 've already had discussions with our CEO and in the breakdown of the hope landfire the last what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deficit there 's a lack of understanding on what people need to do what they should have planned and how they actually read and take in the information that is presented when there is a significant event and so as a shire we in that the early stages now but we are planning to have a bushfire forum type thing where people can come in and actually learn more information concerning those type of events and what they can do what they shouldn 't do because the key is to actually be able to educate our people so that they are confident the worst thing you can doing I suppose these situations is panic and we don 't want people panicking and then making poor or bad decisions which eventuated someone getting hurt we want them to actually be able to make a clear educated decision on what they will do for their own personal safety and if that is that they get out really really quickly that 's fine that 's what they do coming back to this specific issue though with the wimpiest age I didn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues raised and comments made by residents there were but if someone who purchased a house in an environment like that I think the comment you made on the road giving people besides were there on that basis and that clear understanding someone whose pets could just have in a nice new estate would expect there 's more than just one Road in or out the question that you asked about the salesman or the bill that when you actually build the house but I 'm interested in the reality of having purchased a house in the stage like that everybody would plan and the first thing they want to do is evacuate the area the volume of traffic all those sorts of things I think we probably need to understand the width the area yes the Whitby Estate has a great big beautiful sign up that shows a finished development of what it will look like overall once everything is developed which could take many many years given market values and all that kind of into how fast or slow the developer tool builds so when people I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home and land package and that they probably look at the big picture which shows you know a high school here or primary school there set of shops here X certain entries roads and streets here and here and here without an understanding that these estates are built in stages but within saying that there is a lot of documentation and conditions put on the developers when these are approved now when we look at exactly what has come about with we 'd be in the meeting that was called Whitby has one access road in and out at this point in time you can 't see we 'd be a state from the highway you can 't see it from soldiers Road you really can 't see air from Cannon Street until you get to where that entry is because it is completely surrounded by bush land and finally it is a major attraction for people to actually go and buy and establish their homes in these areas and I think when you look at what was discussed and stated at the community meeting that was held last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of issues that come together as a complex issue now the way to actually I suppose work through this is to actually break those issues down because those issues are not all the responsibility of the one person they have numerous different people that are responsible for the smaller issues when it comes to telecommunications telecommunications are a federal issue so we need to moving to that federal space and start and get the discussions happening in that space now whitby is not the only area in the show of seven-time Jared al that has issues with telecommunications we have issues through wit be managed on Jared I 'll serpentine even Byford I 've got friends that I cannot sit in their house in Beaufort and make a phone call or receive a phone call on my mobile phone I actually have to walk outside the house that is in Beaufort so obviously child communications are an issue they are one part of the the complex issue with Whidbey when we look at the access in and out this is a discussion that needs to happen between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were invited to the weekly meeting because they had correspondence between our director of development services Andrew traffic and the the developer so there was communication there and the developers didn 't attend they were aware of it I am understanding of the issues raised by the community because you know when you watch what 's happening on the East Coast there is a certain amount of fear that comes with this and I think with the issues that we 've seen happen through the eastern states it makes people more aware of their own surrounding and they start looking at it and that so they go oh hang on we 've got an issue which is good that it 's been raised because it needs to be sorted out [Music] my belief is and I will stand by this 100% that adroit rusick with the information he provided to the community on that night did a fantastic job I have gone back to seen in the weak sense and asked a lot of questions and received a lot of documentation that I have myself have actually been through now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a response from the developer that has now happened and there is a meeting scheduled for next week between the Shire and the developer there is actually two meetings scheduled there 's one at a lower officer level just to sort out a few little bits and pieces but then there is a meeting between our CEO director of development services and the developer to Pacific least work on this access and entry issue I would prefer not to say much more in that space I need to let those people work through that I have seen the documentation I know where the Shire sits and I do know that Andrew with the information he presented to the community did a fantastic job what we see being yeah and this is it and I 'm probably disappointed in the front page of the examiner this week one because they didn 't have a reporter there so everything that 's been reported is second and third-hand and they 've reported in the paper I am disappointed in the attack on Android traffic as a professional that is employed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving I suppose backwards from that our local MLA has not had a meeting with the Shire and actually sat down and have has an understanding of the information that the Shire holds on this subject matter that that meeting is yet to come and I suppose the one the other thing that I am extremely disappointed in and I will say a little bit angry is the attack on our captain at the manage on fire brigade he is an exceptional firefighter he is actually a resident of the Whitby estate so he was there in his capacity he does he was there as a resident and when things got a bit heated and people started saying a few bits of people pieces which he knew to be incorrect he actually tried to explain from a firefighters point of view and there the fact that they need to have plans in place and what they should do and what was reported in the paper has been taken out of context massively and they only reported tiny grabs of of pieces that they were given second and third-hand now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our two major events because Jason watt is also one of our deputy chief bushfire control officers through the Shire he has an extensive knowledge of firefighting especially in our local area and for the way that he was portrayed on the front page of the paper is disgraceful we hear what you say what someone thinks I heard you say and corridor the reality is that from a community perspective the issue apparently is affected there 's only one way in one way out if there was a bushfire at this afternoon residents potentially trapped in that area because they 've only got one way to go the prison topology of the residence Association tells me this morning there is in fact a gravel track there is a road that comes off the southwest highway called Riley Road yes it is a cos edit Road it does not go all the way through to the stages of development that have happened and thus far in the whitby estate the section of riley road that is made the shire maintains who 's obviously on our our maintenance register as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meetings between the Shire and the developer need to happen and mean to be allowed to roll out with what comes out of those because there is information or there is there is stuff that is printed in the conditions of the development of the estates that should have been done that hasn 't been done you should respect that things need to be addressed in discussions here with those parties my question would be I suppose simply that if there is a hidden Road that traffic is impeded on or then are able to reverse can that be addressed in an immediate context if graters need to accessible the part of the road that the shire is responsible for is accessible by all vehicles so two-wheel drive vehicle can use that part of the road the issue is from where that road finishes in the development to where the developer has built the roads where the houses have been developed is that a priority in the in the sighs moving forward to solving this problem that 's connecting that up so that that road does flow through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shire to make sure that the developer completes the work that they need to complete for their development that would appear to be a very easy solution in terms of putting ease people 's immediate concern were trying to build the access in and out one that exactly the example of doesn 't necessarily have to be a bushfire there was some sort of an incident on that main sort of therapy in at the end of the day everybody will say very emotionally that the show should be doing this child should be doing that the show has limited funds and when it is not the responsibility of the Shire the show should not be spending rate payers money doing things that are not our responsibility so in that context we need to let show in the developer you actually sit down and work through this process and I 'm hoping that this process it 's not going to be a long one then it will be dealt with extremely quickly jungjie on issues that common sense prevails asyraf its obligations it is meeting those obligations and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chiron that 's exactly right so if there 's any experience watch this space at the end of the day where the show seats is our community 's safety and amenity is a priority the Shire doesn 't stand to make huge amounts of money out of these developments what we get at the end of the day is that the developments are handed back to us we maintain them over a period of time for the benefit of the community and that 's what people pay rates so you know that is that is where the Shire seats subdivisions like this at subdivision stage it 's a state government responsibility the shire doesn 't have the ability to approve subdivisions that that 's a state government deal that they deal with that sort of it yeah that 's exactly right when it gets down into you your local planning like your like local structure planning the Shire has a lot more input at that stage we have important the subdivision stage we can make recommendations whether they are all picked up by the state government or not he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do take into consideration there was the recommendations that local governments but not always so there is varying levels of what is our responsibility and what is not what we can import into what we can influence but the one thing when we come to things like this that we will fight extremely hard for is our community up until I think 2015-16 there was no requirement for developments to have more than one access that the requirement to have at least toward a minimum came through various reports from from various large fire events that happened like the the Kelmscott fires the park of your fires the Margaret River fires the information and the reports that came back out of those incidents actually informed the planning at state level who then said right we need to have more than one exit entry into estates in these areas when they 're planned so this one Falls slightly just in that mix I have read a number of the reports and we need to let the Shire officers who know their job they know exactly what 's in those reports deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the community in a number of issues that come from that that you 're not in a position or wouldn 't know the answer to but clearly if there it should be a second access point to work to residents and it isn 't there whose problem isn 't wise and that the if it was a fire at this afternoon and residents had difficulties in getting out of the estate all of those things had flow on effective impact anybody know Susan 's heaven maybe it should have been police and other things called the workout but clearly the development playing a major role in rezoning and look if there was a fire event near this afternoon we have fire brigades that are extremely close they get called out immediately as soon as somebody smells or see smoke if you are in that situation the best thing you can do is stay at home and wait follow all the information that comes through on the défis website the emergency website and you 'll be able to follow the information the fire brigade are extremely good at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a matter of minutes comments made people look at and they just don 't expect it to be pets well they anticipate it 's closer than where it is but the reality is that not to know where to get information from it 's a bit scary that people rely on the social platform rather than the emergency website which is the place to go to people don 't know that Davis have a Facebook page and they have the links from their Facebook page to the emergency website so people can follow those follow that the défis website because Davis in most of these incidents the lead department both of the significant events we 've had have been défis fires because they have been handed to doofus very quickly because of the scale way of escalator to and doofus are very good they have a full media team to get information out into the public to keep the public informed of what they should be doing that is the only information you should be following in the event of an emergency and come back to through common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a bushfire plan ready if you have it my goodness doesn 't matter where you live with this house is important and look through our local fiber gates we have our bushfire Ready Group that I constantly out within the community at various events they will come in if requested by a community to come in and have a day or an afternoon with them they provide a lot of information on how to be bushfire ready how to build a fire plan all of that information and they are more than willing to be out in our community educating a community to help look after myself human and one of the frustrations I 'm sure you deal with on a very regular basis I like that thank you for the chatter on that one but watch this by see if you are specifically interested in the rebels and will keep you abreast of that as well because so it 's clearly the impact anything this is not the first occasion there in the state of that kind it 's had an issue of this sort because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by as well 29 minutes past 00 here on 107.3 but I say thank you to some of our sponsors 27 minutes to the 27 to 11 here on 107.3 power to the people of John Lennon one of the one of the universal acclaim entertainers that still leaves a mark would assume that you 're part of the people we 've got the president of the trauma center on Jared aisle with this morning council I 'm so rich and just chatting that as about specifically would be but in broad principles as it 's the case and it 's great to see because their growth this within the southeast corridor here and specifically within within the Shire continues issues of this growth thing and the impact dollar access and whatever else would be not the only estate within the Shire that says no it 's not we have a few Millbrook State Parkway at the Jared I 'll Hill is another area that we have had community members voiced concern now that estate is predominantly hint five acres and larger blocks it has a bush reserve as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry given the nature of where that estate I suppose is situated it is a bit more difficult to do with because it 's not a residential estate and it is a well-established older state that has been there for a very long time in in the concept that it is today it does have a number of static water supplies that have been installed over the years for firefighting now my understand is that they used to have access through Bush tracks through State Forest which no longer available and I 'm not sure of the context of what they were originally available for either so I don 't know if they were actually available pacifically for bushfire exiting or not but given the fact that they go through state forests and if you 've got a fire up there I personally wouldn 't be leaving cleared land to go into a forest to get away from a bushfire so but the the Shire officers have been spending an awful lot of time working with community members to find a way through this to make the area a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not going to make these areas safing that kind of it is and I think it comes back to people needing to have their bushfire plans for themself in place and especially your larger property owners when you 've got people that have you know five to ten acres that they need to make sure that their properties of bushfire prepared as much as they possibly can now you know that there is a certain amount of responsibility from the shah 's perspective but the the people that live there also have to take on a certain amount of responsibility for themselves I think the expectations of someone who buys a five or ten I could walk up the hill in that strong rural location it 's very different to someone who buys a little house on a little block in a clear subdivision where expectations and I think requirements which should be very very different we found had two access points in an area anytime possible the Land of Oz I mean some people need to have a bushfire plan it 's paramount when you choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a beautiful sides of the bush is also a very dangerous side to the bush and you need to be aware of all of that that summarizes it so beautifully all those years ago in terms of flooding rains and sweeping plains and everything else that goes with it you know there are challenges these will they don 't go away but it will come back to what was a reasonable person do you choose to look at the bush guess what you think I know your challenges that come with having a bushfire plan it 's not just it 's not just protecting yourself it 's actually helping if there is an event that the fire is to be able to come in and have defendable areas where they can actually help defend your assets and all your life yeah that 's triangle straight through the listener ears that fire breaks around their properties is the requirement for them to be I think three minimally generalize you because I 'm not in a position anymore tech to worry about fire break I think that there 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that you meet local bylaws with a fire break but there is also a four meter vertical requirement yes police but hasn 't been too concerned because I 'm not quite recognized but hey you don 't hang in bushes in your fire break you know people say I shouldn 't have to have a fire break because a three meter wide strip is not going to stop the fire it might not stop the fire what it will do is depending on what the fire is like slow it down but the main thing that it will do it will give the fire brigade members and the fire trucks a safe clear area where they can actually have the vehicle if I truck and themselves where they know they are sitting on ground that is not going to burn now if they get caught in areas they need those areas like that where they can park and drive their trucks and have themselves as safe as possible doing what they do for our communities so in that context fire breaks are extremely important we and at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasure you certainly did in your role as president of shot of celebrating laughing along our national celebration it was we had a hundred and ten new Australian citizens join us on Australia Day that is a record for us it is double or over double what we had last year for Australia Day it was more than mantra so you know it 's we had a fantastic day we started off with the the Australia breakfast which was supported and we had help shy wise from our local community groups the local Lions Club wrote tree our Baptist Church from Byford you know local fire brigades helping those those areas as well we had our citizen Australia Day awards for our citizens that contribute greatly towards our community in various different areas and you know we had some good nominations for those Awards issues which was great and then we moved on and because of the numbers of citizens new citizens we had doing their commitment to Australia this year we ran that in two different time slots and yeah look we just had a fantastic day yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community service award for more than 20 years service over various different community groups to Ayrshire so a very very worthy award winner in tom for that Marilyn I can 't remember her so no I 'm sorry she was awarded our Australian Day Citizen Award for the work she does through the Monday John United Church group in around organizing and holding space meetings and that for alcohol Alcoholics Anonymous mrs. Colleen Rankin received our senior citizen award obviously I think Colleen 's just known by about everybody for the work she 's done over a numerous years in numerous areas come and go that the dedication and the giving of time by people did you know I actually think we 're running out of awards to present Colleen I think she 's won just about everything so far let 's see it again try to see that those that had the opportunity to nominate because it without citizenship rewards happen throughout the year but they have so many come on board literally and be acknowledged and take that pledge that that recognition of moving forward to to next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people in around you that you don 't take a lot of notice of it they 're just there and they do what they do have a step back and have a good think about who 's doing what around you because people say oh I don 't really know anybody but then when you actually do have a think you can come up with a dozen or more people that are more than eligible for these awards and all of these people don 't do it for an award they don 't expect any recognition but as a community we should be providing that recognition for what they do for all this thank you it is forward any issue that might be discussed this morning check out the information on the set on their website there 's a lot of information it 's all there of the matter of just taking the time and the of course the Facebook page keeps up to date and the more immediate sense with what 's happening and activities and look I think to a shara officers should be acknowledged for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days like Australia Day we are I suppose a very new community in a lot of senses and we are growing and we are evolving and that is not an easy thing to manage to be able to keep most of the community happy with the way we do things in that and and there is reasons things change we have to our community is changing we need to remember and respect that the older part of our community we need to work in the here and now and we 've also got to be able to look forward to what our community is evolving into and the Shire officers are doing an absolutely fantastic job in that space and it 's not an easy space for them to work in at times our shy staff deserve so many bouquets for what they 've achieved recently thank you for that it 's great to see these fantastic it is absolutely fantastic we had our opening on the 17th of January the official opening and naming and our paws in the path of fish 11 very very well-attended we had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there I have never seen so many well behaved dogs in one area and I must say it is the first time I have ever seen in the flesh an Egyptian hairless dog and he was absolutely magnificent hey I was enthralled he was beautiful and he just strutted around or nice stuff but look we had a fantastic night down there for the opening the the park itself is well utilized by community members and on a whole they are extremely respectful of the space they have a Facebook page going at the moment it 's a BART Park and the glades dog park something along those lines and they get on and make playdates for the very friends and all it 's it 's fantastic to see it is great with a discussion starter and ice breaker and I think nothing easier than having your pet along with you and here 's the suddenly the things you find in common with people and look do you know what we are extremely proud of the dog park it was put together with a huge amount of community important they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshops to help design and show us what they wanted it to be so in that sense it hasn 't just been the shire building a dog park for the community it 's been the community working with the shire to provide a facility that they want and you know as SJ is part of the pure region it is the first dedicated official dog park of this nature in the whole Peel Region so we are extremely proud of that fact as well so if you and getting involved well you should do because it 's a it 's it 's a beautification and a safe area for you to let you don 't off lead and time lasted right eyford get down there and have a look and have appliances different direction but certainly a similar level of activity is the skatepark great to see that that there 's only as far as the younger not they 're not so younger members of our community yeah our gift development team I 've worked closely with a number of our youth in the community sadly they lost one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids have been wanting to put in place something to remember different with yeah and through that the work they 've done with the youth development team and that they 've come up and they 're they 're actually going to paint a mural at the Beaufort skate park and the kids have actually worked really really hard because they 've gone out and they 've actually done applications to gain funding and everything for the supplies and everything to make this happen so they 've been part of this process from the very very beginning they approached the Shire they asked you know we want to be able to have a remembrance type of thing in place and they have worked from the very start of that process all the way through to the end so I 'm actually extremely proud about kids that have been part of that process to get from you know where they had an initial idea where they 've started working with Shire offices to the point they 've now got to where they 're mural will be happening for everybody to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the loss of in the individual but to see the the yes the other members of the community coming together in a meaningful way and in its own ways of course has helped them develop and the life skills that come from these circumstances we possibly do this case although I think yeah very much so in the neighborhood with me at the moment the president for the sharp said no no no that 's what the show first time 2020 what 's happening we are I think we touched on this the last time and I 've been a little while but the yep journal entry statements in that space Jared I 'll entry statement we 've had a number of community consultation workshops with the community which I 've attended in jeredy where the show offices have been working through that process with the community overwhelming support that 's come out of the two workshops I 've have attended is that the community would like to see the sign that is already there retained and repaired fixed so that is the way we 're going community is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the communication again I like why that pettite exam will be further information coming out in the next few weeks to the residents up in the Jared L area that this includes so you know what she 's space the sign will soon be send you back we are proud to do this song of the year a lot of us get out and enjoy and that 's what surrounding a lot a lot more than that at this time of the year than others but in doing so some of us take advantage of the beautiful water holes and the opportunity to really get out there and enjoy some of the waterways in another great example of what 's around them beautiful as a destination to get along and enjoy with your family just get out and suck in the fresh air but there has been issues from the public health point of view yeah look it 's I suppose this is probably one of the areas where the community don 't have a full understanding of how the Falls is managed serpentine Falls is an absolutely fabulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of us take for granted a little bit it is our regional tourist attraction for the area and it 's it 's magnificent the shire don 't manage the Falls because it 's part of the serpentine National Park it 's managed by state government Department but what this show does do is we do water regulated water regular water testing to make sure that the water is safe for humans to paddle in and swimming that kind of thing and we report those findings to the state government department which is responsible for the Falls so you know as part of our water testing regime that was found that we had bacteria levels there that were harmful to humans so that was reported it was put out into the community as an awareness to say look this is what has been tested this has been found so the the Falls are closed for water access at this point in time obviously following on from that further water testing was done and completed and we got to the point where the bacteria was no longer there and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low flow of water which is just you know one of mother nature 's things and we just have to be aware of it and we need to take the appropriate steps so when it was found that the bacteria was present state government Department closed the Falls for access because of that and once we got the all-clear through the water testing that the bacteria was no longer a threat their day defaults were reopened and that 's the reality of it sometimes as water levels and what would normally perhaps be moving through it make it a super enjoyable area again it 's good to see that something as essential as that is part of the regular housekeeping oh yeah it 's just one of those regular things that a shower offices go on with and work in consultation with the the state government department responsible for the management of the force so the be confident unless revised otherwise that they 've been maintained and your health and well-being it 's been and the integrity associated with it he 's always under review and no way compromised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they haven 't already get out and get some tickets to have the opportunity propping up the bit socially most of living in the James it is last year 's our first opera in the mill last year absolutely blew me away that the night itself was just absolutely magical when you had looked at that

approach by zoom i will take that as an apology being received from councillor wrench we have no approved leave of absences nor applications for leave of absences so moving to public question time oh prior to starting council do you any of you have any interests you wish to declare then we 'll move to public questions although is there anybody in the community you 'd like to excuse me madam president could we deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the correct order and i stand starting with the questions that councillors have provided prior to the meeting sorry members of the public have provided last night at the last minute yes now i 'm back on track the following question on notice was received by mr larry graham the summary of the question two which was on the 29th of november 2021 the foi commissioner ruled that information i had sought access to under the foi act was not exempt at mata as claimed by the shire so i asked the shire so i asked why the shy has not forwarded me the relevant information the response is the letter received from the office of the information commissioner on the 29th of november 2021 had indicated the disputed information is exempt under clause 3 1 of schedule 1 to the freedom of information act mr graham had not been forwarded the information as under section 24 the disputed information had not yet been redacted from the documents he had asked for the disputed information has since been redacted and mr graham has been provided with a copy some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foi request was about which which particular foi request this was just bear with me my part of my screen has disappeared and i can 't read it um can we remove the section on the screen with council revenge please i can read the answer we just council wrenches coming online right just allowing that counselor wrench has been able to attend and we are just making that made right for i cannot pertain that uh from the question as it is i 'll defer to the madam ceo police if you could clarify that question madam president i 'm not able to provide an answer to that question right now and i would request that you take that question on notice thank you all right okay so having got that clarification one moment counsellor are you asking leave for a further question or clarification clarification if i was a question there yeah if we don 't know what it 's about who gave the answer i would suggest that the answer was probably provided sometime in the formation of the agenda and the ceo do you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to do with uh contractual matters but i will provide a further clarification in the minutes yeah so just for clarification it was well we 'll have to wait and see i 'll come back to that counsellor just so i 'll come back this is not a debate thank you no i 'm not i 'm not having a debate i 'm not telling you i might come back to something later you want that that 's fine that but that clarification will be sought and added it is somewhat difficult at times when an officer 's report is done to know which of particularly if there 's been several are there any further questions with re that were taken on notice maria or is that the only one right thank you which case then we will move to to public question time thank you mrs hall you do you wish to raise some questions if you could please set to the podium is there a staff member present to just check that the microphone is actually operational right just please provide your name and address and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road one one moment mrs hall it might we either need to get you to hold the microphone or move it closer okay master making it a bit difficult to hear okay right so it 's elaine hall and it 's two day west road kernel and my questions are with regard to the jewelers pool bin doon road works the first question is were existing traffic movements monitored prior to commencing road works mr agustin would you care to answer this question please i believe i answered these questions already here we have traffic counts they are two years old yes sorry i didn 't hear the answer the shire has conducted traffic counts on on truthful bin during road the next question is what were the readings i have to take that question or notice so that was on notice the third question is what will be the completed carriageway with seven meters seven meters seven seven meters yes that doesn 't include the shoulders the shoulder is from memory 500 millimeters so a meter in addition so the the actual lanes need to be 3.5 meters each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulders sealed shoulders so that i can provide you with the drawing um later oh really it should be 10 metres the carriageway should be 10 meters and you 're making at nine just bear with us so the information is up on the screen the proposed seal width is eight meters and proposed formation is nine meters is that correct that is correct and the shoulders is 500 or a meter in addition does that answer your question mrs hall yes thank you mr foley you 've indicated you wish to ask a question yeah it 's brian can i take this mask down my glasses are fogging up yes if you 're not breathing directly on anyone you shouldn 't we 'll just get them unfold yeah it 's brian foley i 've been doing jewels pool road so coincidentally i 've got a couple of questions on in jewels pool road when the shoulder repair why wasn 't the edges of the bitumen repaired and not just filled with gravel again i 'll have to defer um to mr augustine how long ago was this repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but within a week or two all the potholes were uncovered from this gravel no repair work was ever done on any any actual bitumen breakaways it would depend on what which section the section that they 're doing the shoulder work on where they broke all the trees down and everything there along that section i have to take your question and notice think there needs to be some clarity exactly yeah yeah it 's um but that question that that answer will be provided to you mr foley i can um have a chat anyway later uh the other question on bin new jerusalem road is i know you 've agreed to do the arborist repairs on the trees when is that schedule for i mean april i can 't give you a definite date at the moment all right [Music] any more questions that 's my two i 've got a couple more to go are there any others that wish you asked a question if mr foley if you 'd like to just hold on to the remainder of those questions i 'm sure we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the podium yeah hi eric twine um 160 leaming road uh new nile um i just last year between and i can 't give you an exact date between seeding and harvest i went to the agricultural freight route forums held by the state government the federal government had given them 200 000 to do work on freight routes basically and mainly the the discussion was about railway lines but a very interesting thing that i noticed on the board when they had stuff up on the borders point things was that the main roads was prepared to look at taking back roads from shires if if they 've become uh well yeah more arterial roads than just shire roads and i was just wondering if the tj shire has considered applying to the main roads with regards to the jewels pool binding road is one exact thing this the um state government in their wisdom put the uh sale yards at musha so there 's a lot more traffic on that for that road for that road to get to the new show sale yards now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been the majority road which leads onto the irishtown road and uh to binge road excuse me and the reason there is that there 's always been a lot of freight going through there anyway the pejorating and irish town road get a lot of hay traffic as well as grain traffic as you know um a lot of the um limestone that 's going to northern comes across through kalingri and then down there um and and the fact that last season cbh um closed the bulgar bin so a lot of the grain from bulgar came down through 2j to the evan or menard wheat bins um because even though klinger 's a um strategic side it 's going backwards it 's costing you money to go back mr twine is very interested in the background of this but we do need to basically capture questions yeah the question is has the tj shire looked into applying to the main roads to have some of these roads taken back because it 'd be save us a lot of money if main roads had them i can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've just become aware of this however we will be certainly following up and looking into this matter and thank you for bringing it to our attention and just briefly another um with regards to the tiny houses or tiny cabins tiny houses tiny whatever they call them um i i i know they 're not approved yet so we don 't know the answer whether they 're going to be there or not the only one concern which is not a mindset i 've talked to the people that have done it that are operating them and people that own the land because i actually leased one of the blocks that some of them are going to go on to just tighten it up for the question there yeah yeah yeah a bit of background um is this is is there any likelihood of the shire putting conditions on the agricultural industry like they have done with the extractive industries now that this is going to be a tourism in this industry in regards to movements of vehicles on weekends and stuff like that because i 'd hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i 've just had an indication from our plan and mr divorce that that 's not um the case so no it 's not on the horizon and it 's not been raised in discussion yeah i 've read the agenda and there 's no no conditions being put on but there was no conditions about saturdays when the extractive industries were started either 20 years ago but that was that was 20 years ago and i think um we are an agricultural community that that is most definitely our primary uh base of our cultural identity and our economic and that will certainly be a consideration if that proposal should be raised i cannot see the use of small businesses such as this having an impact on general business thank you miss if there 's no further questions mr foley would you care to resume uh the low flow standpipe what 's the position of that within the show at the present time the commit you 're referring to the community one in the main street yes this is a great pain to us as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were under the impression the part was on its way however recent conversation is they are actually preparing a hybrid part with a higher heat resistance the ceos in fairly regular contact we are still waiting so at this stage it has not been shipped as soon as it shipped we can get it installed it does seem to be a fairly common problem at the moment with supplies however it 's a very frustrating and badly timed one for us maybe nobody told them 2j got a bit hot now in the meantime would the shire look at actually opening that up so people could still get water but not be charged i think i think you need to bear in mind that the shire pays for the water that comes through that standpoint so that becomes a cost into the budget that is then a cost borne by the right paths as a whole so therefore would probably not be and we have you know this point has been raised but it really wouldn 't be fair on the community as a whole if a few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay okay next question is regarding one of the agenda items which is a community grant scheme which was wonderful has have you got any plans of how this would operate at this stage if it gets approved the community grant scheme have you if you 've read the agenda it 's basically to provide a framework around an accountability for community money that is received in rates being redistributed back within the community so the purpose is simply that through applying and having to explain what the use is by being able to account for the expenditure of the money that they receive there is accountability to the community of those funds of how they 've been spent within the community it 's a fairly it 's from their point of view is very little change they they apply prior to budget as they 've done in the past it 's considered a budget and then at the end of their allocation they would be asked to account so they 'll be asked to provide some evidence of that expenditure and how it was used thank you last question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roadworks will be 1.7 kilometers north of the cemetery for three kilometers does that include the uh drum and rose hedge i i was going to mark it out on the my speeder but i forgot to do it hugo may know excuse me could you please put your could

thousand dollars is now been vandalized by holes being punched into the walkway and also motorbike traffic is using the access please take note that these actions result in ratepayer money being diverted from being spent on better purposes that would benefit the community in order to address vandalism council has seen the departure of three councillors since october councillors brian raynor and therese chitty who did not contest the last election in october 2021 and councillor benjamin bell who resigned in january this year councillors rainer and chitty elected in 2013 dedicated eight years to the community in part as shy president and deputy president respectively councillor bell was elected in 2017 and served four years all councillors served during the notable achievements of the completion of buttery cottages and the design and build of the 2j recreation centre but also during a very difficult period of political turmoil council recognises their contributions their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we thank you my activities for from the since the last meeting are recorded there for community notice moving to item 9.1.1 five tiny cabins at lot 2 gamaling road through gemaling 2j road dumbarton the officer 's recommendation is on page 13. do i have a mover for this item counselor heart are there any questions and clarifications further to the those that have already been submitted council appears from our gender briefing i did bring up the situation that there was to be a management plan and i was led to believe that this will be included in the conditions that the applicants provided a management plan as a condition could i just have some clarification on that please certainly councillor i believe the management plan has been received and i will defer to mr devos yes that 's correct we 've received management plans for this and for the later item as well and conditions have also been incorporated into the office of recommendation clarification madam president i don 't think that 's the officer 's recommendation we saw at the agenda briefing no mr devos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management plan i appreciate that i think there are other changes as well if they could be explained mr devos would you care to war council through the changes that you made to the recommendations absolutely thank you councillor mcewen the main one i 'll start with is the change in classification there was discussion at the agenda briefing and which is included in the body of report and just bear in mind this is for this item and also for the later item as well where the shire was considering a reclassification from holiday accommodation to tourism development subsequent thought within our department has we 've decided to revert back to the original classification that has been applied for which is a holiday accommodation and that 's been changed and the officer recommendation furthermore i 've added point d which is a request for a detailed management plan to be submitted and approved by the local government and it 's outlining the various elements um that we would require in the management plan i can confirm that this plan for this item and for the other one has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you maria can you just scroll to the bottom of that and allow us just to read the rest thank you councillors have you any questions that are arising our council appears yes thank you for including the management plan my concern is what will occur if the applicants do not follow the management plans and what is sought as on these conditions will there be um i 'm not sure if the correct word is penalties but what happens in the event that the conditions are not met it would be my understanding as the plan is conditional to the application that the application then would be with not the application but the permission would be withdrawn but i 'll see clarification from mr devos thank you so as in with uh any planning approval that the shire puts forward and applies conditions of approval to if these conditions are not met then it 's a breach of the planning approval and there are it 's a compliance process that we obviously follow as an administration there are penalties under the act that we can apply in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections which case this item is carried eight zero moving to item 9.1.2 reconsideration sorry section 31 reconsideration of lot 77 for jordan road bejordan the officer 's recommendation is on page 17. do i have a mover counselor mccormick thank you any questions or clarifications counselor mcewan yeah the only suggestion i 've got is a slight approval a slight change to the recommendation in regard to part b which refers to the existing causeway at the south of dam one it took this there goes i 'll read what it says the existing causeway at the south of dan one will be restored and widened to enable mr at max dead to be that should be to be able to drive a vehicle across so that 's one modification but the other one i 'd like to put in is that there should be no change to the water pipe at that position so it shouldn 't be raised at all during that process certainly mr davos would you care to respond thank you council mcewen so if you if maria could please scroll down to the conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbered 2 till 5 will remain unmodified to allow for nature to run its course so we 've captured that um so there 's to be no further modification at all and that 's captured in in that that condition there with regards to the first point i i was under the impression i went through and changed it this morning with that slight wording change yeah no it 's in that same clause clause b that 's the cause that 's where he 's going to drive across yes i just wanted to make sure that during that restoration and widening that that water pipe it must be a water pipe there is there yeah that 's not that that 's not my that 's not moved it 's not raised that 's included in the plan and that 's are you suggesting an amendment to that or no based on what mr devos has said if it 's on the plan not to change it then you 'll leave it right thank you any further questions or clarifications any objections this item is carried eight zero item nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden dowel road new now officer 's recommendation is page 23. do i have a mover once again madam president this has changed from the agenda briefing so perhaps mr devos could lead us through it absolutely mr devos would you care again to take counsel through their changes thank you council mcewen just to re-iterate so we were previously looking at reclassifying the actual land use from holiday accommodation to tourism development and that 's what has been contained in the body of the report subsequent to the agenda briefing however we 've had further discussion as a department and believe that it should revert back to the original classification as holiday accommodation so the recommendation has been changed accordingly also in line with the requests taken at the agenda briefing we 've included a condition regarding a management plan the management plan has been included in the attachments because it was provided today by the applicant thank you councillor ruthen you have a query thank you so part d 2d refers to a detailed management plan is to be submitted to and approved by the local government so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've actually been supplied the plan already and it would just be to the satisfaction of the shire administration in that instance so do we need to change the wording for that i think it just becomes a um i guess an erroneous condition it 's probably not required but it doesn 't hurt the the um recommendation either way we they 've supplied it so we can just mark that off as as being complied with i do have one question what provision has been made if any sort of emergencies should arise at the site during occupancy uh thank you madam president if you just bear with me i 'll just bring up the management plan so at the end of the management plan document the applicants have provided a 24-hour emergency contact telephone numbers and emails for complaints um and um for any issues there 's for maintenance and so on there 's a host of other numbers that have been provided the shire is satisfied in this instance that they 've taken appropriate measures to be able to be contacted in the case of a normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones that they would be going for thank you if there 's no counsellor pes just getting back to that point d number point that council ruthen made up would it be of advantage to say the management plan is to be submitted to the satisfaction of the local government rather than have the word approved i would suggest that it needs to be approved am i correct miss yes so in this instance um it 's it 's it 's very common for us to require management plans from time to time on a range of different development applications that we see we don 't feel it 's always a requirement to bring those approvals back to the council and believe that they can be adequately managed at an administration level if there are no further questions do i have a mover counselor sorry just one more question given 2j 's patchy phone coverage um do we know what the reception or service is like in these areas so if anybody needed to make an emergency call is that possible that 's a that 's a very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please thank you coming back councillors this is the remover for this motion council appears if there are no further questions or clarifications are there any objections which case this item is carried eight zero moving to item 9.1.4 lot 97 beaufort street west 2j this is a five dog application the officer 's recommendation is on page 27 any questions or clarifications counselors is there a mover counselor jury any objections we have two objections do i have a seconder council of heart thank you council jury would you care to speak to the motion place yes i feel that the lady has had the dogs for um all their their lives they um are of an age where um they are getting much older and won 't be living much longer and to now have to say that she cannot have the dogs would not be fair on the dogs or to the lady itself obviously she had them when she lived in new south wales on semi-rural and in residential areas as well and had them registered they 're well looked after and cared for so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pram property if they 're maintained and looked after and kept and closed councilman mc mccormick would you care to speak sure i oppose the uh the recommendation based on uh there seems to be a recent trend where three to six dogs permits keep appearing and i i just think that um it sets a precedence possibly sets of precedence uh where applications continue to come through which is against the long-standing two-dog policy that 's all thank you councillor hart would you you second the motion would you care to speak yes i would um taking council mccormick 's point about setting precedence my own view on applications like this is that each application should be judged on its merits alone yes we can there are examples of unfortunate outcomes by some dog owners but i don 't see that this should reflect on any individual uh dog owners application so from that viewpoint i support the motion councillor psu i 'm sorry councillor ruthen you also objected do you wish to speak thank you as hard as this may sound i think that the owners prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked what the local conditions were that would be applied i personally think that five dogs is too many in february alone there have been on facebook 11 or 12 dogs escaped in 2j and i just don 't support five dogs do we have another speaker for or against um yes danielle um councillor wrench here i would like to speak for i whilst i do agree that we are receiving a number of applications now for three to six dogs um there is a um an allowance for some for our community to apply for this and um these dogs as um counselor jury mentioned these dogs are getting on in age um and i you know i believe a few of them have not very long to go sad to say um and i do think that each one should be taken on merit and um the background we 've done on the applicant shows that these dogs have been kept kept well maintained well and there does not seem to be any adverse information in relation to them so i support this application thank you councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however i do strongly object to more than two dogs per owner where except for the exceptions of working dogs obviously animals who are assisted living and there are a few rare compassionate exceptions i do appreciate that the owner has owned these dogs for a long time that they are small breeds that they have recently moved here and it would be a very difficult decision to make i do also appreciate that it is a fairly uh relatively large property for the breed of dog and that containment is possible and should minimise any noise or any other discomfort to the neighbours however our provisions have not been particularly strong and i think this is an area that we as a council really do need to look at because we are constantly being put in a position of having to make decisions that are while consistent with policy they are not really consistent with the intent of this community and it 's time to review i will be supporting but i 'd like to see some changes made to our dog policies and put some consistency into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the right of reply if nobody else wishes to speak thank you madam president i don 't wish just replying thank you in which case i will put this item to the vote all in favor this item is carried six two the councils that vote up seven two what was that i said thank you councilman you threw my count out it counts as 6-2 those councils that voted against were councillor mccormick and councillor rutherford can i see a show of against police thank you thank you almost moving forward to the community funding policy this has been explained a little in the questions that mr foley raised the office 's recommendation is on page 30. and it 's that we adopt the community funding policy as attached to this report and requests the ceo to make the policy publicly available on the shire 's website do i have a mover thank you council jury do i have any questions or clarifications do you have any objections this item is carried 8-0 item 9.2.2 the monthly financial statements officer 's recommendation is on page 33. i just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do i have a mover councillor ruthen any questions councilmember kieran i 've got some objection as well madam president if you 'd right so would i ask a question now okay certainly look i 'll ask a question asked at the agenda briefing just for the information of those that weren 't at the agenda briefing just as one example on page 166 of the agenda attachments referring to capital expenses there 's no year-to-date budget for any capital expense to the end of december so so all the years of eight budgets to the end of december capital expenses are zero which implies that we had no budget for any capital works in the first half of the year that can 't be possible so that 's my question is why are the year-to-date budget figures all set at zero to the end of december i will have to defer that question to statement would you care to answer so when we adopted the budget we we didn 't have year-to-date we didn 't adopt year-to-date budgets for the construction program we should have noting that we due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done in the latter half of the year anyway so we can definitely bring that back as mentioned last week through the media review process and and deal with that though do you have any further questions counselor mckeon no just objection not a problem you 'll have an opportunity in a moment do we have a seconder then council appears councillor ruthen would you care to speak to the motion no i don 't have much to say apart from the fact that there were questions rage raised at the agenda briefing and i was satisfied with the answers thank you councilman mcewen thank you madam president look my aim in objecting is not to criticize the actual report that 's not the principal name although the report is clearly deficient it 's not i 'm not attributing blame for that i 'm just trying to draw attention to the fact that the current shire financial software isn 't working correctly and while that 's not working correctly we 're not getting informative financial reports and i just need that to go on record but if we just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that problem and that 's not just administration 's problem that 's council 's problem as well thank you do you have any particular wording of that that you would like it record it as oh if you need a reason why i 'm the reason i 'm voting against it is that the monthly financial reports are not providing adequate information or even accurate information about the financial state of the shire due to due to errors um due to current difficulties yeah yeah due to current difficulties with the conversion of the something like that yep all right thank you so do we um council pierce yes i am supporting these reports i understand that there are immense problems with the transition to the software package and this is no criticism of the administration all of our council staff but until the transition occurs and reports can be correctly generated i feel that we are caught between a poor place and accepting integrity and honesty of the staff that what is being presented is correct thank you our counselor is there anybody else he wishes to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my own viewpoint uh as an elected member if we have a look at the office 's recommendation it is that council receives the monthly financial statements for the months ending 31st of december 2020 131st january 2022. councillor can you just slow down and repeat that a little more clearly thank you all right let 's try that uh that the office 's recommendation that council receives the monthly financial statements for the months ending 31st december 2021 and 30th 31st january 2022 my own viewpoint as an elected member is that i 'm here to make decisions on the best information that we have available to us at any one time notwithstanding the issues that councillor mcewan has correctly highlighted i see this is the best information that we have and i 'm quite happy as an elected member to run with it thank you thank you councillors any further speakers if not councillor ruthen you have the right to reply nothing more to add thank you thank you then we 'll put this matter to the vote all in favor right that councillor wrench how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you just confirm against thank you councilman mccurran is voted against item 9.3 a governance review action plan progress report oh i 've jumped i have to write please it 's item 9.2.3 list of payments the offices recommendations page 36 do i have a mover please council region are there any questions or clarifications that have arisen out of this matter are there any objections which case this item is carried eight zero moving to item 9.3.1 governance review action plan the progress report the officer 's recommendation as i stated earlier is page 39 do i have a mover for this item counselor heart do i have any questions or clarifications any objections this matter is carried eight zero thank you item 9.3.2 policy review process offices recommendation page 44. do i have a mover counselor jury thank you any questions or clarifications any objections this item is carried 8-0 understanding order 9.3 item 9.5.1 bushfire advisory committee recommendation the officer 's recommendation is page 49. as a point of community interest because ears do pop up when we mention fire the bushfire advisory committee recommendation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating procedures 2.5 use of flash woods during bushfire operations and 2 approves the update of the bushfire operating administrative procedures to include sock.25 by the community emergency services manager so do i have a mover council appears any questions or clarifications any objections it 's carried seven zero eight zero writing eight saying seven item nine point five point two the environment advisory committee eac native vegetation offset for proposed clearing for roadworks the officer 's recommendation is page 55. do i have a mover thank you councillor hart any questions or clarifications yes councillor pierce i 've just noticed that this offset is for the mitigate the potential impacts of future shy of 2j projects so this will be for future all future projects that we are putting aside this place is that correct not exactly the it will depend on the areas that when a task sorry when an offset is required the department defines the size of the area that they wish this area here which is quite a large area will be able to be used until such time as we basically run out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word impacts of future shy of 2j projects because it you know maybe three or four years down the track future projects won 't be able to use that that 's what i 'm saying am i being a little bit picky it does say future here am are we at cross purposes here councillor or am i misunderstanding you oh maybe just being a little picky to me it just reads that potential impacts of future show of 2j projects but it may be in three or four years time that this offset will not be sufficient so do we need to say put that word future madam president if i may it doesn 't say all future projects so i there 's an implication there that should we run out of space in the covenanted area then we will have to come back to council and revisit that thank you any further questions or clarifications council mcewen so who who is going to keep track of this and can we have it included maybe in the council or information bulletin that we receive from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes thank you i think um we can certainly track it across um uh all of the different departments that would be needing to utilize a clearing permit process and yes certainly it can be updated into the counsellor information board councillor mccormick with respect to this uh environmental conservation covenant is is the is the proposed body of land fenced uh and secondly will it require fire breaks on the perimeter mr devos would you care to respond um if i might be able to defer to the sum who 's actually in the room at the moment right that 's it okay um i 'd actually have to uh probably take some of this on notice i 'm assuming the lot of land that 's being spoken about as the one i think is being talked about so as i haven 't been involved in this process okay that is the um that is a lot of land that i was thinking about so yes the show does maintain fire breaks on that land already and a covenant wouldn 't prevent or stop those works needing to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need to be maintained does that answer the question yeah sure that 's one of them but the second one is part of that bush line goes again goes up against uh paddocks so i 'm just wondering if if stock is um fenced in at the moment or you know if that bush line is fenced at the moment it would be my expectation that if they 're keeping stock there there would be a fence is anybody able to confirm that we 'll have to take that on notice and get i have to take that on notice thank you thank you any further questions or clarifications any objections counselors if there 's no objections then this item 's carried eight zero as there 's no other business to madam president there is there are a number of questions provided on notice by councillor mcewen which we 've provided responses to thank you thank you the following questions were taken on notice were received from councillor mcewan councilman do you wish to read this out can we can we see how many questions are they mariah you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time you finish reading madam president i indicated it yes sorry given these have been supplied and they 'll begin the minutes i don 't think i need to read they 're quite complicated they 're not complicated they 're quite detailed the questions yes it does add years to our lives so madam president if i may just point out though i indicated at the agenda briefing last week that given the time constraints of officers at the moment some of the questions need time to analyze and and properly respond so some i have put that response in into maria if you can go up a little bit further so that i i can actually just show right to the beginning please so question one we 've basically said that we 'd like to take on notice until the april um council meeting question two there has been a breach and we will be following that up with the department of local government question three

who are also traditional custodians of respective lands within the show of 2j i 'd like to pay my respect to their elders past present and emerging i 'd also like to say before we really get into it welcome everybody and i 'd like our viewers at home who are watching the meeting via the live stream that our public gallery ought to be aware that you can be seen on the live stream viewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i 'm expecting that we will have a very improved quality for those that cannot attend we don 't have we have not received any apologies or counsellors are present nor approved leave of absence or applications for leave of absence are there any disclosures of interest counsellors that haven 't been made yet if not then we will move through to public question time except i don 't think we have anybody here who is going to ask the question so if we have no public question time then we 'll move through to the body of the report and the first item on the the first item on the agenda is 9.1.1 which is five tiny cabins lot two gaming germany road dumbarton do we have any questions or clarifications councillors we have we had received a number of questions that have been put in council jury you submitted two questions would you care to read out the your question and the answer to that do you have those in front of you you can read them off the screen if you would like first i 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tourism it 's caravan park and campsites my question is with that change of classification and approval will it give the proponents the opportunity to establish camping grounds on the property in the future thank you would you like to read the answer or the officer would you care to provide the uh thank you councillor jerry uh the proposed land use is defined as follows uh tourist development means a building or a group of buildings forming a complex other than a bed and breakfast a caravan park or holiday accommodation and it 's used to provide short-term accommodation for guests and on-site facilities for the use of guests and facilities for the management of the development and answers your question no will not give the proponents the opportunity to establish camping grounds in the future under the current planning framework caravan park which takes its definition from section 5 of the caravan and camping grounds act means an area of land on which caravans will sorry all caravans and camps are situated for habitation this is an x use in the rural zone under the shore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this could happen in the future would be if the scheme changed through this game amendment counselor jury would you like to ask your next question yes environmental considerations table 2.2 native vegetation modifications clearing potential environment risk identified threatened ecological communities it says to be confirmed declared rare flora to be confirmed last identified as significant through a local biodiversity strategy in trepan intramaps to be confirmed do we have any indication as to a time frame for these surveys to be carried out and reported to the shire through the chair thank you um i did actually hear back from the applicant shortly before i raced to this meeting um he 's provided me with some mapping that indicates that there is no threatened ecological communities or declared rare foreigner on any of those sites thank you just take a moment wow council appears would you care to provide your question on notice um well it was quite uh involved basically that the application is from bingara it 's a company and a search title reveals its addresses in victoria with only one employee and however the address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly an absentee loan owned land owner the other application i combined them is a 2j residence so my concern was really how will the cabins be managed and as the application the cleaners will be employed to service the cabins but that doesn 't actually say about management and also a part of it that when the development was advertised as and i do understand there is a time frame as per the regulations and the officer did provide that for me but when we receive an application in december when many farmers are busy and then january when a lot of people are away my concern is that perhaps sometimes people miss significant advertisements in the paper on facebook on the shy 's website so how can we as a council address this issue so that basically with that questions i think and the manager for planning mr devos as this is your department would you care to respond certainly thank you um i 'll just address the uh the application name and so on um really as long as the name is correct um that 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we sign off on and so that was correct where the they are physically addressed doesn 't have any bearing um on whether we should or shouldn 't be approving an application moving forward i do note your comments about management of the property and as will be shown in other responses to questions later on we 're actually seeking to request a management plan be put into place by the applicant and we 've already been in discussion with the applicant about this so that 's coming up later with regards to the public comment period i certainly take that on board um we 're in a bit of a quandary because the regulations which have been prepared by the state government actually say the except acceptable period of time for this is 14 days we 've actually gone to 29 days which is even beyond our own policy um in answer your question the only way we can really do that is by altering the policy and actually putting those specific dates so christmas period and um and easter i think i would suggest is the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other the other thing that we need to note is we 're relying on the goodwill and grace of the applicant to actually agree with those extensions we have to get it in writing from them nine times out of ten they will and they 'll be they 'll be fine with it but the shire has experienced a case in the past where um basically it was deemed to be refused because it went over that period of time and they took us straight to the tribunal over which we want to try and avoid thank you i did notice that in your response i think that 's what you 're referring to this management plan do you envisage that that will be an amendment to the condition in the office 's recommendation yes that 's correct thank you counselor pierce you didn 't have another question did you want to uh answered that as part of this okay thank you i did ask also that in reviewing the application that there is a bushfire plan and was to be reviewed annually or my concern was that how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed annually and it 's just not left and the manager of planning assistant manager did respond to it mr divorce would you care to respond yes absolutely so we would consider that a compliance matter as we would with all of the development conditions that get put through so with regards to bushfire complaint compliance that would be delegated to our bushfire control officers the rangers or the cesm to be able to review how the plan is being implemented on an annual basis just further to that i understand that they will be responsible for it but what process will be there in to ensure that it is complied with the reason for that is because we 've had development applications before for example extractive industries where they 've been asked to produce a surveyor certificate about extraction and some of them have never been completed so what process will be that this ensures that that plan will be reviewed uh well that 's obviously an administrative uh function that we 're looking at um so i guess one way that you could do it is to formalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is provided back um not i don 't think it would necessarily require to come back to council but to the attention of the ceo just so if you wanted to we can do it that way and that will actually be a formal condition then but um i mean normally these things are just mattered from done through our day-to-day administration i think that is a good condition to consider due to the possibility of fire and that could be a risk that we need to be aware of thank you very much councillor councillor ruth and you also had a question on notice my first question was is there a permanent residence on the property for the property owner or property manager as the and that was related to the fact that there doesn 't appear to be anything on site to go with part c under tourism development which is for the management of the development on site instead so instead of using tourist development could a new classification be added under holiday accommodation to include the tiny cabins through the chair i believe i actually did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent residence the other doesn 't with both of them though when we look at that aspect of the definition the facilities for the management of the development that doesn 't necessarily the way i i interpret that is that it doesn 't necessarily denote a physical dwelling of sorts facilities could mean a shed for holding tools for example the other aspect of the definition is i don 't think it 's a requirement that all aspects are present at any one time only that the type this type of definition provides the flexibility for those elements to be included as part of the proposal however should the applicants be of the mind to expand their development in the future given the classification that it has it would still require development approval or change of the existing approval through through the show thank you can i just add to that um i think my concern was about these cabins on a property with an absentee landowner and the management if anything happens how does that get managed yes so if a councillor can refer back to a previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management plan will actually outline a whole range of things that we expect management of and that includes complaints management and risk and so on so and then that would become part of the substantial substantive approval that 's in place can 't counsel please just moving on from that next week when we look at this item in the agenda will we have the management plan before us before we debate this item through the chair yes it 's in the works we have specified though the way i 've written the condition is prior to the commencement of the development which is still a satisfactory way to proceed with it thank you are there any first questions councilman mcewen thank you madam president yeah just one question on this item going back to one of your previous answers there was you mentioned an application where time had expired and the application was deemed to have been refused what are the implications of that as an appeal um my previous experience with it is that it doesn 't get um heard to know though i think it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it would be that we 've just determined it as an organisation as a refusal then it would go to a mediation and then um hopefully a mediated outcome could be reached and then if that 's not the case then it would go to a hearing in which case it is heard to novo yeah sorry i just try to work out the difference between the shire refusing an application in which case we probably have to give a reason and the shy being deemed to have refused that 's that 's a very good point i i think the reason given is that it would just be consistent with that um clause and the regulations that it 's deemed refused and the the regulations don 't specify that a reason needs to be given from that point so councillors are there any further questions towards this item if not we 'll then move on to the next item of business which was reconsideration of a section 31 reconsideration of lot 77 per jordan road majority councils are all familiar with the details of this item i believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not questions on notice questions that have been submitted so council jury you had two questions that i can see that you had submitted would you care to read them and um mr devos you will be again asked to respond thank you madam jeff um 9.1.2 um lot 77 the jordan road point b the wording it 's the wording is able replace it to be able to drive it was just a corrective stare and point d in the recommendation it says no re-vegetation i just asked is mr max did remove vegetation during the construction of the dams which events thank you thank you for your question um when we did the site inspection at the mediation it was unclear what existing veggies that what the existing vegetation state was prior to the unauthorized works occurring it was considered that the best option from an environmental perspective was to let nature do its thing and to begin to recolonize the area rather than let the applicant go in and and re-vegetate as we considered that was potentially more damaging or more risky to it so we didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetation had been removed thank you very much council appears just one small question so council has been asked to consider the office recommendation in the recommendation was this virtually what we just had in our mediation or our meeting with the uh parties yes that 's correct it was uh further to the question of council jury i just noticed that on drawing number galp 001 which was on the attachments on page one two eight that the we have struck out a number of uh notations on that map but two remove damn wall and infill have not been struck out i assume that the officer 's recommendation that there will be no sorry that the remaining dams number two through to five will remain unmodified to allow for nature to run its course is actually stands and this is an oversight on the map is am i correct i believe that 's correct we can we can get that fixed up lovely thank you very much any further questions to this item councillors thank you we 'll move to the next item of business which is nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 woodendale road new nile councillor jury you have asked the question to this item would you care to proceed thank you it 's an amendment of a word just being corrected from complete to compete thank you thank you councillor rosen you had a question the question i had on this item was the same as the question i had on 9.1.1 and i 've received the answers thank you maria are there any further questions when for that item no councillors have you council appears you wish to speak um in relation to this item as compared with the first one with the five cabinets will we also be having an amendment that we have a management plan for this tiny cabinets also please yes that 's correct thank you any further questions on this item if not we move to item 9.14 a lot 97 beaufort street west 2j a five dog application counselor wrench you have a question yes my question was in relation to the five dogs and only two being registered and a query about the other three and would those registrations come across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes so uh only two dogs are allowed to be registered at a premises until such time if council approves between three and six and then the remaining dogs can be registered you had a second question second question was in relation to the wording of 0.5 on the officer 's recommendation following number of dogs permitted change to be to will be reduced to two um rather than the revert to lesser number provided in the clause um just to provide clarity mr devos do you wish to respond yes through the chair i actually referred this through to rangers to have a look at who provided the response but i shall read it out i agree that the statement may require further direction but in the event of a local law changing it may be a good idea to refer to the local law rather than the number please find a few options for the wording below the third statement doesn 't refer to the local laws but may explain it better first option is upon the death or disposal of one or more of the above dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reduce to two the second upon the death or disposal of one or more of the dogs the permit will cease and the number of dogs will revert to the number of dogs limited as per the sheriff tj dog 's local law and the third option is an approved three to six dog permit is to only regard the dogs listed above on the permit and upon the death or disposal of one or more of the listed dogs they shall be removed and not be subsequently replaced by any dogs thank you council ruthen you have two questions that i can see yes i did thank you the um okay so i my questions have been answered so the street address is 65 beaufort street and how long has the applicant lived at the address and that since august last year i have another question now and it 's going from those three recommendations for changes to the wording so sorry maria can you take it back down thank you um if we went with any of those the application is for five dogs and so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more of the listed dogs so say one dies does that mean that the applicant has to reapply to have four dogs please bear with me while i just examine that condition i believe the way it 's worded that would be correct there were two there was another question for councillor rosen my question was were the all of the dogs registered in new south wales prior to the move to wa and the answer i received was yes and further to that i was curious about whether they were approved in a residential area because this the zoning of this property is special residential uh through the chair i don 't actually have that information available uh we can certainly ask the applicants and provide further clarification counselors further to decide your mother any further questions are councilman pierce please yes marie if you just scroll up to where you 've got the three options you 've actually got five five five there could they be clarified to one two three one no through the chair if i may they are all um options for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the three thank you any further questions counselors if not we 'll move to item 9.2.1 community funding policy we 've not received any questions so are there any questions on the floor with regard to this item if there are no questions we 'll move on to item 9.2.2 the financial monthly statements for december 2021 and january 2022 councillor ruthen has submitted a question here council ruth would you care to respond to your question thank you my first question or my only question on the financial statements was is the datascape issue likely to delay the budget review the inability to report sorry the financials um through data escape is not expected to delay the media budget review it 's just that it will take a bit more effort to pull the thank you and may i clarify that it will mean a bit of a difference in the presentation of the review than is what is normally provided is that correct thank you any further questions councilman mcewen thank you madam president on the first page of the financial report well it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers anyway page 165 in the attachments okay under operating expenses of operating expense the fourth column and let me see let me explain this the second column gives the year-to-date budget for each of those operating expense items the third column gives the year to date actual and the fourth column tells you whether we 've overspent or underspent on the items listed and nearly all of the items we have underspent on operating expenses for example transport and infrastructure which is the third last item we 've under spent by over a million dollars but for some reason and i 've asked this question about governance before for some reason we 've overspent on governance by 737 000 can someone explain how we 've done that please mrs bateman would you care to respond sure so um the ups and downs across the the different programs is a result of being unable to run depreciation effectively in that escape and also the um overhead applications that are generally done on a monthly basis but we 've been unable to do those effectively through the datascape processes so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm thinking about this so governance has been used as some sort of a suspense account is that correct yes sorry so um governance is a holding area for um overhead so when when it comes to wages for example not all of our wages are posted to administration they 're allocated across the other programs at the budget thank you it 's taken me 18 months to get that answer that 's great so okay so we 're on operating we 've underspent by a million dollars total operating expenditure if we go to the go to the next page for capital expenses we 've had a total capital expenditure year to date of 660 eight thousand dollars but there are no year-to-date budgets for any of that can you explain that one so when we prepared our budget we didn 't have the um project time frames in place so we didn 't have so we have an annual budget but we didn 't break it down to months that was because of the timing of the budget adoption and the um not being able to get our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of that capital expenses it says we 've overspent by 668 000 that 's not actually the case is it no it 's not okay so that carries on to the bottom of the page where we have a net closing deficit of 365 000 so that 's not the case either is it no if we reviewed the um year-to-date budgets for capital we can we can amend that at the review i know i 'm not supposed to make suggestions here so i 'll make them later here councillor before you progress i 'm just finding where you 've mentioned the closing budget what was the figure again uh yeah sorry madam president down the bottom of that second page so page 167 166 ah yep 365 000. thank you yeah okay i 'll i 'll discuss it offline yeah thank you are there any further questions regarding this item please counselors i can see you deliberating there councillor mcewen now i 've got a lot of questions but i understand the difficulty that we 're having with datascape which is giving rise to some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it i may say something next week but i 'll leave it for now yeah so what i would recommend is to have that conversation perhaps with the manager of finance or with the ceo so you feel more satisfied prior to the ocm because sometimes it 's very difficult to answer that within the ocm when the data is perhaps complex to be retrieved yep i think we all appreciate the difficulties that everybody is uh going through at the time so moving forward to the just lost my place here mr payments counsellors item number 923 do we have any questions that have arisen yes we have uh councillor wrench please mine was more of a general observation that we have a number of different accounting fees bank fees and such forth that show through our different accounts each month and i was my query was have we negotiated with our providers to see if they can waive some of those fees or look at other options that don 't actually carry those fees thank you mrs bateman would you like to respond sure i 'll read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be waived but we did query the issue with the overdraft fee back in october the response was whether you have a high or a low overdraft balance you always pay the same fee we also pay fees to the commonwealth bank for use of the f machines and they are higher i don 't know if that was in your question they 're higher in these months um for november because that 's when rates were due and they 'll also be higher for um when the installment installments are also due so they do go up and down depending on the number of transactions that are processed do you have any questions further to that council rent or have we lost reception i guess no no questions but it would be good to sort of you know see what options are available yes it would save us a few dollars certainly something we need to think about with budget council reason mine sort of is related to councillor ranch 's question and it was about the the numerous payments of very small amounts sometimes less than a dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more efficient for these to be consolidating consolidated into one payment per week fortnight or month and add to that when we 're talking about bank fees if we pay extra fees for the number of transactions is that impacting on our bank fees if there 's numerous individual payments being made i can definitely look into what impact those small fees have on our bank fees with with our in our bank accounts um in terms of consolidating those smaller payments into weekly or monthly amounts there would also have to be a reconciliation process attached to that so at the moment it 's quite easy to reconcile the small items straight off the bank statement as opposed to consolidating and then going through the to check that everything balances thank you i understand i worked in the bank council ruthen you have another question there actually two okay are the water account charges for the shires leased properties in other words when the ones that the shire leases out passed on to the lessees for example o 'reilly cottage and the bank building etc um yes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the applicable lease clauses okay apart from the doogee park water cost the next most expensive water payment is for the old depot in harper road is this for the men 's shed and can we have an explanation of this seemingly excessive amount thank you sure so the majority of the water at harper road is used for short operations and services so watercorp are currently investigating the number of sewage services attached to that bill the water usage for that bill was only around eight dollars so the rest relates to services maria would you like to just capture the cost of that would you care to just repeat the cost for maria so she can enter that in the question hopefully my memory is correct i think it was eight dollars and 19 cents for water usage and the rest was for 41 fixtures which are being investigated thank you council appears you had a question my question question related to the mcleod 's lawyers advice that received we had a dispute with adco in the water and i just would like to know what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i will defer to the ceo for this matter thank you madam president um the matter has not been settled the advice from the lawyers was that there was insufficient evidence to pursue at this time and so the um suggestion has been that accurate monitoring takes place of water usage over the next 12 months because there may be a possibility of being able to retrospectively put in a claim thank you when you 're ready maria can you scan down thank you council pierce i believe you 've got a series of questions here would you like to have them i do believe the manager finance might have answered these because i noticed that there were large amounts for the cba and now she 's indicated this is when we have rates payments and the fpos machine has been used that would be why the other months were so small when machines not used so thank you maria can you just go back to the last question there of course appear so i can check there was one further down no down a bit further i just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finance department that anything that we incurs expenses in fires differs will be refunded but my question was how does he offer how does the finance department achieve this is differs invoiced for these fees that we that we actually pay mrs bateman so um those payments would be funded through the local government grant scheme for the bushfire brigades and ses services operating grants so they they allocate those grants at the beginning of the year and for 2122 we received oh we were allocated 237 000 so every quarter they they pay us so throughout the year we spend the money and every quarter we will receive an installment thank you and my last question related to space to code is an online booking service which we pay 165 dollars per month and i 'm led to believe that is how people access and book shy facilities i have raised concerns as people have a couple of people have said to me they have difficulty in using this system and i 'm just saying that my question is we are charged 165 dollars but have we remedied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiently and not have problems mrs bateman um so space to co have offered some solutions um we 're in discussions with them at the moment about you know other options um even to the point of looking at you know if this could be managed in-house or um through the shires website but at the moment um we have we have a meeting scheduled with with space to co to work through some of these issues thank you are there any further questions on this side okay if the knot will move to item 9.3.1 governance review action plan progress report are there any questions arising beside councillor pierce 's question councilor pierce yes in the office 's report it was mentioned that we were to workshop this um review that has happened but we have not we didn 't have the time to review it so my question really is was does the officer see are there any significant changes or review that would benefit from a workshop before council debates this item next week um the report is actually a report on the progress so there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by council late last year in september last year um or the only thing that has happened is that this uh there has been commentary against the progress on each of the actions thank you any further questions counsellors i 'll move to item 9.3.2 policy review process i believe we have a question here from council the jury council jury please proceed thank you my question is that there 's 20 policies to be reviewed but it shows 25 in the costings i was wondering um how many policies do we actually have that we will be reviewing and would it make a difference to our advertising costs please uh through the chair uh the website lists 23 local planning policies 20 of these are considered necessary for review in addition there are five other policies to be created or revoked or reclassified which will require advertising thank you very much any further questions counselors the next item is 9.5.1 bushfire advisory committee recommendations we 've not received any questions preceding the meeting i have any questions arisen now if the last item is item 9.5.2 eac native vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not received any questions counselors have any questions or sensorism if not then i will declare sorry madam president if i may just interject um councillor mcewen has it um submitted a number of questions on notice which haven 't been included in the agenda as yet will be included in the in the minutes i have indicated that it may due to capacity issues it may be difficult for officers to answer all of the questions in time for the meeting next week and if that 's the case we would seek leave to take some of those on notice thank you thank you very much for your patience everybody i will now close the meeting at 1 49 p.m and thank you for your attendance you,"(-31.50373859999999, 116.3721711)"

the meeting and that cause may not be taken in chambers you must leave if you need to make a call and other than that when addressing the gallery we would like to see respect and courtesy please refrain from opinions that are defamatory or are unpleasant in nature we refrain to the business of council as a respect to the community thank you very much records of attendance i would like to put that we 've had two apologies councillor stephen mccormick and councillor danielle wrench are unable to make the meeting today councillors we have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public questions councillor pierce you have a question yes just on page the opposite page to where you 've got your opening then we 've got the uh listing of the who are the councillors and the deputy the deputy we 've got councillor bill recorded there but i believe that he should be removed as he has put his resignation in i 'm just drawing your attention to that thank you council peers julie noted thank you before we start i definitely would like to first do a welcome to country and acknowledge our nunga baladong and eward 's peoples who are the traditional custodians and the respective traditional uh custodians of lands within the wider shire of 2j i 'd like to pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging we 'll move to public question time are there any people present in the gallery today that would like to ask questions of the council if there are no public questions then as we 've not received notice of any other matter do we have any public submissions certainly miss duval would you like to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we need microphones now one moment we 've just changed our visual audio system so we 've got a slightly different process that i might add we 're all becoming familiar with mrs duvall if you just state your name please and address and your submission and correction it 's not mrs davao it 's miss miss thank you um shelley davao 303 hardest titty road um i 'm here to speak against motion um and i believe that we should feel the vacant position um vacant the values of the show are integrity accountability inclusions inclusiveness and commitment and i believe that this motion goes against those values someone pointed out to me last night that they felt the local government act was interpreted incorrectly in the agenda briefing now i haven 't had a chance to look at that but i do think if there 's any doubt of the interpretation of the act in this case then vote for the motion but my reasons for putting speaking against the motion is is about good governance and what 's best for the community so no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been i believe it 's no relevance in what is best for the people community because what 's best for the people of community is about representation governments and governance that comes with that representation and i believe that 's what you need to base your opinion on so i put forward in in my argument for this is that to reduce to not fill the position and reduce the number of councillors to just eight councillors gives precedence to a higher risk of a tied vote and i think it doesn 't matter what the committee or the council any council anywhere even number where then one one member has the ability to cast a vote on a subject that is obviously contentious or closely fought i don 't believe that that 's good governance in any situation no matter who that member is or what council part of the the agenda briefing also then brought forward the consideration that for some proposed reforms by the minister it leads the way to reduce the numbers down to seven i don 't think that you can make decisions here today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not happen in the future i think you have to make decisions based on what the facts are and what is in place today so i don 't believe that that should play a factor in your decision making one of the implications which was the financial implication i also believe shouldn 't have any bearing the fact that it 's not budgeted for everyone individuals businesses councils up with things that happen that are not budgeted for recent times the administration have had staff resign there hasn 't i presume there wouldn 't have been a question that they need to be replaced it wasn 't budgeted for you need to replace staff and i believe that this is also a fact i don 't think that a financial implication is a good enough reason in governance and representation of the community to make a decision for that representation for that it 's not good governance to base it on that financial implication we still had wards one ward would be underrepresented and i don 't think that we would be having this discussion but we don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole is underrepresented if you make the decision to not fill this vacant i put it to every councillor here that at some stage you put your hand up because you felt you had something to offer to the community and that you felt you had a role to play and that you wanted to represent the community and i put forward that i believe the best way to represent the community is by rejecting this motion and we fill that ninth vacancy so that the the town of tj the community of tj is fully represented thank you thank you very much mr val very well articulated are there any further submissions thank you which case if there 's no further speakers we will move to the purpose of the meeting and the shire officers report the item is 9.3 9.3.1 the regarding council of representation the motion the officer 's recommendation is that council requests the chief executive officer to seek the approval of the electoral commissioner to allow the elected member vacancy created by councillor bell 's resignation to remain unfulfilled until the ordinary elections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister 's relevant proposed local government reforms whichever is the sooner two notes that in accordance with section 4.17.4 of the local government act of 1995 the term of the member who held the office is to be regarded in section 4.6 as ending on the day on which it would have ended if the vacancy had not occurred that is the first officer 's recommendation so i think we 'll address the first officer 's recommendation and then we will address the uh second officer 's recommendation which relates to nominees for the two vacancies that have been created in our committees the as a delegate to the bushfire advisory committee and as a delegate on the development assessment panel so do i have a mover for the office 's recommendation thank you council appears are there any questions or clarifications certainly councillor mcewen thank you madam president oh my mask has just broken as well i have a few quite a few questions i 'll work through them slowly and i 'll request some clarifications as well so under the background to the report it states that councilor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not possible so when because sunday in january wasn 't the 15th it was the 16th and it was the 15th it should be saturday so when did councillor bell resign i 'll refer to the ceo through the chair my apologies that is a typographical error councillor bell submitted his um his resignation at 9 15 on saturday the 15th of january thank you the second question is relates to comments and details in the fourth paragraph the officers report under comments and details referring to the current reforms proposed by the minister the officer states that council has indicated a desire to investigate reducing the required number of offices for elected members from nine to seven when did council indicate that desire first i i will respond we have not formally indicated our desire but certainly in concept forums this has arisen certainly it has arisen in workshops that there was a general interest to explore this naturally part of the process of ex prior to to actually applying to the advisory committee it does need to go to public consultation it and that of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply we apply for something and therefore it happens there is a process or quite a lengthy process involved prior to that actual application so council hasn 't indicated a desire yet formally no okay well that 's so council hasn 't indicated the desire i will take your i 'll take your position on notice thank you thank you third question is that office uh so it relates comments and details to the next paragraph officers proposed that council seeks the approval of the electoral commissioner to allow the vacancy to remain unfulfilled unfilled but there 's no reason given anywhere in the office 's report on why they recommend that so what so why are officers recommending that when no reason is given i will oh i 'll refer that to the ceos as an officer 's report thank you madam president uh the the reasons given uh to do with the implications so the first is the uh the financial implications and officers were also responding to the informal desire expressed by council to reduce the number of councillors in i think january last year okay but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take your word for it back to comments and details what 's one thing that 's concerned me about this whole meeting is that the meeting was called to consider options following the resignation of a councillor that was the notice of the meeting but the officer 's report only considers one option not options so let 's go to comments and details the first line refers to sections four eight four four point eight four point nine and four point ten to the local government act now section 4.9 of the local government act indicates what it doesn 't indicate specifies what the options are following the resignation of a council that requires an extraordinary election so there are options the officer 's report doesn 't tell us what the options are and we 're being asked to make it a decision based on one option only when the purpose of the meeting was to consider options so for the moment i 'll put this to one side the difference between the reason the meeting was called and the agenda excuse me the question is thank you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election i will again refer to the ceo thank you madam president if council chooses not to resolve the officer 's recommendation the local government act will prevail um and yes you 're quite right there are no options that have been provided and i apologize for that okay but it 's one of the options is an option that the president holds is there any reason why the president didn 't exercise that option no you 're quite correct will you refer to the option up excuse me just take one moment to read that option i 'm i 'm familiar with the option now i wasn 't too sure what you were referring to to be quite frank i didn 't consider it and i did it i didn 't consider it in the sense that we were and i probably wrongly was quite aware of the process that is in place with the reduction of counsellors we had considered that the election coming will possibly be null and void to the question if the reforms come into place which is certainly indicated will happen before that however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been put to council in hindsight whether we wish to set a date and i stand corrected can you clarify what you just said about the election being void if the if the reforms go through if the reform should come into play prior to the election which we have noted which is the normal electoral process that and that reform is to reduce our council to seven members then by that election period we are already at eight councillors so we will be reduced further so the in the context of this particular recommendation putting of setting the date at that election for another council would not be would no longer be relevant because we would know lot we would already have too many councillors so in that sense that was what was in play when we were considering the reforms that if the reforms came in and required us to reduce to seven and we have a council of nine by that election we are still one council or more so we would not be replacing councillor bell position at that election the proposed reforms are open for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 25th of february that 's correct so what 's the likelihood of those reforms being enacted by parliament before this election is called i have no more um foresight on that matter than you do well i know apparently you did because that was the reason you gave the reason was we it was a consideration and it wouldn 't actually it wouldn 't make any difference i 'll come back to that okay i 'll leave it at that for now certainly that 's it so there are there are there are four options as the ceo has pointed out under the under the act one is that you could set a date one is the council could set a date the council hasn 't been asked to do that or even referred that doesn 't even get referred to in the agenda what the third one is we don 't set a date in which case the electoral commissioner sets the date and the other alternative is that the electoral commissioner can have no election based on for whatever it is so okay so they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only considers one option and you are quite correct all the options should have been presented that 's just the question so that 's okay at the moment my last question refers to the officer 's recommendation and point two of the officer 's recommendation which refers to section 4.6 of the of the act but 4.6 is not mentioned anywhere in the offices report so what does 4.6 of the act actually refer to section 4.6 if we 're going to vote on it i think i would just like to clarify you 're talking about point two yeah it says that notes in accordance with section fourteen point seventeen four uh of the local government the term of the member who held the offices through regard in section 4.6 as ending on the day on which it would have ended if the vacancy had not occurred i 'm just reading this out for public interest thank you so i will just refer to 4.6 thank you we 're just bringing up the current act the act we have at the moment is the original so 4.6 is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we can scroll down 4.4 when the two and 4.41 says when the term of office of an electomeo or president or councillor is going to end under the table to section 2.28 an election to fill the office is held so my question can we go to 2.28 then no you you had it there thank you elected mayor or president or council elected an ordinary election on the day after the ordinary elections day sorry i can 't see the head of the column all right so so please raise your point my point is if we don 't understand and it 's apparent to me now that we don 't the implications of that 4.6 why is it in the recommendation if it can 't be explained who says it can 't be explained explain it to me we 've gone to 2.28 and we can 't find it because nobody 's been able to show me the reference in 228 that 's referred to madame madam president may i speak yes certainly um i actually checked this last night i read it my understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this person who resigned in this case it would be considered at the normal time that this person would have served his tomb of officers office that is when the vacancy in other words that that 's how i understood it when i read it that we 're asking the commissioner to ask for this position not to be filled because and the term would be ending in the normal time if he had not been resigned for clarification does do you think that means he remains as a councillor until that date no he would remain a councillor if he had not resigned he has resigned but the term of the office continues until that date when he would have finished that was my understanding when i read it last night okay i 'll leave it there for now all right thank you um i 'm glad that you mentioned because i was struggling a little bit to understand where the the intent of your question was i have to be quite frank and that is exactly our understanding of it and i will refer to the ceo because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to go through and confusing for the public so there needs to be some clarification thank you madam president thank you madam president but i 'll come back to it thank you thank you madam president um if i can just add a further point of clarification what it means is that until the next ordinance it should council choose to seek approval from the electoral commissioner and it is approved to have that vacancy remain unfilled until the next ordinary elections the sharo 2j council will still be considered to have nine elected members but with one vacancy unfilled so therefore if there 's an absolute majority required then it remains the same as if there is nine members thank you madam ceo i appreciate that point i also appreciate that you felt the and should have been the other options made available um and certainly stand take notice of that counsellor well thank you madam president in which case i 'll raise a point of order the special meeting was called for the purpose of considering options following the resignation of a councillor that was the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no that 's quite true however it hasn 't it also has not precluded options being put forward as alternate motions it hasn 't precluded the fact that we may reject the officer 's recommendation so it is not a fair come play it is simply an officer recommendation of which we may further move on we have one officer 's recommendation yes it 's a recommendation it 's not a requirement of council council is aware that there are other options we can refuse to accept the officer 's recommendation therefore there is other options available however imperfect this was we do have other options but they should have been listed eyes i appreciate that okay for clarification then for the rest of the councillors if council rejects this recommendation what is the effect of that through the chair section 4.9 of the local government act would prevail so therefore the councillor councillor madachi could set a date for an extraordinary election if no action is taken then after one month i am to inform the electoral commissioner and the electoral commissioner will set a date for an extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further questions not at the moment my nemesis keep me honest now we will now are there any objections to the officer 's motion thank you there 's an objection noted so we need a seconder thank you councillor ruthen has seconded so councillor pierce would you like to speak to the motion yes thank you um as per the background in the offices report and under section 6 postponement and consolidation of election 4.17 clearly says that council may with the approval of the electoral commissioner allow a vacancy to remain unfilled and the term of the member ends at the end of the date of the vacancy has that not occurred i did some research council in the past 18 months has worked efficiently with reduced numbers councillor greenway resigned in april 2021 and that position was unfueled for six months until we had the election so that meant council had eight council active councillors councillor bill in the past 18 months that is from june 2020 to december 2021 has had leave of absence or was unable to attend 10 ocms osm attendances in the past 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 21 there have been five with eight councillors attending that 's 28 there have been nine meetings with seven councils attending 47 and there was one where there was six councillors so nearly 50 percent of the meetings that were held had seven councillors present during that time council worked efficiently i 'm pretty sure that during that time there were two tied votes requiring the casting members vote to determine that we still need an absolute majority despite how many for some of our emotions despite whether we have eight or nine councillors so an absolute majority is still needs to be present i believe council is sustainable we have representation we have had representation hasn 't been unfilled in the last 18 months we have worked very effectively and there is a local government minister 's proposal and we have no foresight when there 's new proposals and the new act will come into effect that we will be looking at a council of seven councillors i listen to the submission by mrs misterville that we need representation we do have representation the last 18 months has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue the business of council mr bell brought up about wards if we still had wards that means that one ward would be underrepresented underrepresented in previous years many of the awards had representations from councillors who didn 't live in their wards and it seems to be that if you are in those days represented your award that the residents from those wards could go to you and speak to you but that wasn 't the case you could ask i will speak to any counsellor if you had concerns and it did happen so under representation with wards i don 't think holds in that case there is the point that democratically having one person having the ability to decide on issues in a tied vote that is on issues that only require simple majorities not absolute majorities so we still need a council who in those decisions that requiring absolute majorities that must occur so i support this motion also from the point of financial implications this council has been struggling with finances due to different projects that have been instigated we 've had situations where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to me to to consider an extra funds in going ahead with this election but not only also that we also have the funds to expend on a counsellor that we would not have to expend if we didn 't have an extra person thank you thank you council appears mr sorry councillor mckeown thank you madam president the officers report refers to the reduction in numbers as being proposed by the minister for local government this has not yet been enacted at the moment it is a phantom option or phantom report it does not exist this reduction does not exist it is imaginary that this hasn 't happened yet the reduction for the number of councillors has been put forward by the minister for public comment which is not yet closed and at the at the moment is only wishful thinking on the minister 's part reducing numbers based on what the minister 's wishes should not be a current option in fact reducing numbers may never be an option so for today with the law as it stands today that the minister 's recommendations is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agenda and the officers report doesn 't address the alternative options which we are now aware of uh there 's still councilor pearce is still arguing for reducing numbers on the basis that council functioned adequately over the last 18 months but the job of a councillor extends to more than just coming to meetings and i 'll point out that councillor bell who was elected in 2019 hundred and forty three people voted in that election and one thousand one hundred and twenty six of those one thousand five hundred and forty three at seventy three percent of the people who voted voted for council of bell so those people have effectively lost a counsellor now and we 're we 're saying to them we 're not going to bother replacing him that the officer 's report doesn 't explicitly state the reason for reducing the numbers and the process for reducing council numbers is quite complex quite long-winded and is covered in schedule 2.2 of the local government act and also in section uh whatever that 's in section schedule 2.2 of the local government act and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a long and involved process to reduce the council numbers what we 're faced with here is an opportunistic attempt to reduce numbers based on an appeal to the electoral commissioner but without taking the steps that are indicated by the local government act schedule 2.2 came to the meet the one i read the notice for the meeting that was the most noticed that called the meeting was to consider the options following the resignation of a councillor i 'm still surprised that that 's not what the officers report involved i was quite surprised when i got the agenda we 're looking to reduce the numbers from nine to eight without consultation with the rate payers of 2j the people we represent and i just can 't vote for this this is uh this is a watering down of the democratic process as far as i 'm concerned and it may have been a different matter if the agenda brief if the agenda had included more options and more explanation and at least given some reason why this was necessary it 's not necessary some people might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you councillor are there any further speakers or against councillor ruthen thank you i 'm going to reiterate what councillor pearce has discussed um i looked at the records of the last 12 months say 2021 and of the 12 ordinary council meetings only the november and april meetings had all nine councillors present there were seven special meetings in 2021 and not one of them had all councillors present we have demonstrated that we can operate with a reduced number there have been no public complaints about that reduced representation during that time which i find surprising especially now that there are complaints coming up at this point in time the comments about casting votes ignore the fact that it can only be used for decisions requiring a simple majority in a decision that requires an absolute majority a 4-4 split vote would result in a lapsed motion because a casting vote cannot be used and that has occurred in the last 12 months this motion is not about council deciding that the position will not be filled via an extraordinary election but about seeking the approval of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action if the request is approved it will make very little difference to the way council has been running for the last 12 months and if the request is denied there will be an election one more thing um any reference to wards i think is also a red herring because without wards any rate payer can speak to any elected member they 're not restricted to only speaking to a ward representative thank you you councillor hart i believe you indicated your wish to speak yes thank you madam shine president um i won 't flog other people 's horses but i 'll add a few other comments from my own perspective in terms of having nine elected members for a district of this size i would suggest that we are in fact well over represented if we have a look at the city of swan and there are 13 elected members and goodness knows how many people live there i 'd say as a as a district we are top heavy with with councillors i will pick up on department 's apparent view of how we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the department has given its stamp of approval to the way both the previous council has been running and the way the current council is running we with eight functioning elected members have shown ourselves quite capable of delivering good governance on behalf of the cheyenne residents as others have commented absolute majority still requires five elected members so from that viewpoint a reduction of one member has no bearing let 's also have a look at the financial implications looking at the figures and the officers report that comes to roughly forty five thousand dollars to no good effect on the way of governance i see that as a waste of repairs money and i feel that if i was to support the replacement it would amount to a slap in the face for the ratepayers in terms of the minister having indicated yes there is no legal requirement yet but i think there is more to being a counsellor than just following the letter of existing legislation as it happens to apply at the time i think council needs to or could with advantage be aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state legislation right yes i would also like to echo the point that with mostly with almost all meetings owned having fewer than nine elected members only two were decided by the casting vote of the presiding member so as such i see us as being able to function with eight members so why are we recruiting a ninth thank you madam shire president thank you i am going to speak for this and i want to make a few clarifications as part of speaking for this let 's be clear this recommendation is not about reducing council numbers it 's about whether or not when we go to replace an existing councillor who has resigned that is the first part second it is quite apparent from the thought and research that is around the table that counselors have thoroughly considered this matter secondly thirdly what i want to point out is while we could have and should have put the options within the body of the report and which we haven 't that does not mean this report was whimsically put together it does not mean that advice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the administration but there was an oversight in the way that was articulated it has been raised that can that a lot of emotive in my view considerations have been put to this matter and i would actually refute that consideration of variables is a normal part of effective decision making so considering what is happening in the wider world with electoral reform how that will impact upon us what those costs restraints might bring whether or not we have now got to repeat a process that we may have been able to do effectively in one move are all part of the consideration that goes on within the framework of the law and that is exactly what has occurred have we dealt with our agenda today perfectly no does that cast aspersions on the process that was undertaken on the councillor 's research absolutely not now it is my opinion and why i am of the mind to definitely support the officer 's recommendation is that the conversation of removing or reducing councillors which has clearly been successful in many surrounding shires who operate effectively shires of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillors is a moot point because we 're not discussing that today that is a discussion for another day that will be had with the community whether or not the community feels there is a call to do that whether it would be a cost effective would it be an efficiency would it be representation that is not today today we are simply deciding when or should we wait to the election or should we have an election earlier to replace a sitting councillor the evidence around the table to date has shown that quite clearly in the last two years we have operated many many times with eight councillors effectively with very rarely a deciding vote to be required and i think we need to also understand in that time that in 2020 this sentiment that was been expressed very strongly in council and within uh the community who attended the meeting was that the replacement of councillor bill manning should not occur it should be put out to the next election now i think it 's quite clear there was some political motivation in that at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about today so the community has expressed in the past that they this is the path we should take all those considerations were cons taken into account and the reform when we consider this matter so yes i will be supporting this so i now move that counselor pierce you have the writer reply thank you madam president i just had a couple of things to um i do agree that this motion is not about a reduction in the number of councillors but merely whether to get approval to fill or unfill this um vacancy um i do agree that the the report does not have options but if councillors took the time and i 'm pretty sure most of us did when we read under the comments and details it quite clearly states when a counselor resigns resigns from office sections 4.8 4.9 4.10 give us those options so if a counsellor feels that it was appropriate an alternative motion could or foreshadowed an alternative motion could have been raised to address that in in this situation so that i feel that was open to councils to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's basically it that that option is always available and councils reading the report would have gone to those sections of the act and found that there were other options and there was that possibility to have a foreshadowed alternative motion thank you thank you councillor i 'm now going to put the officer 's recommendation to the vote all those in favor of the officer 's recommendation one as it is written i have a show hands thank you the motion is moved five six okay oh five one my apologize i 'm thinking five out of six may i have an objections we yes thank you councilman mcewen yes could we please record the names on the yes certainly could you record uh council mcewen voted against right we 'll now move to the office 's recommendation too that council uh first we need to seek any nominations for the bushfire advisory committee i have received one nomination from councillor steve mccormick the the bushfire advisory are there any other nominations for that position thank you so do we have a nominee for the development assessment panel you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right so councillor ruthen will nominate for the position as we have uh two nominations for one for each we have a nominee of council mccormick as the primary delegate on the bushfire advisory committee and we have a nominee of councillor ruthen as the delegate on the development assessment panel number three request the ceo to inform the department of planning lands and heritage of the council 's delegate on the development assessment panel are the council are there any objections or questions or clarifications matter president sorry to interrupt but because um councillor ruthman is already a deputy on the development assessment panel council will need to nominate a deputy to replace her thank you pointation uh are there any nominees for a deputy i 'm happy to be a deputy on it then we will add point four we nominate sorry madam president if i could suggest that we add in a point three that nominates council appears as dele as deputy delegate and then make 0.3.4 yep that suggestion would be better coming from a counsellor excuse me can you clarify but it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recommendation yes certainly but council have yet to object or ask questions or clarification so it is coming to council 's only recommendation thank you so nominate councillor pierce as deputy delegate to the debt right and we now it 's up on screen that the previous 0.3 has now been renamed 0.4 so do we have any questions or clarifications do we have any objections if we have no objections this is carried under 9.3 unanimously thank you very much madam president there was no mover for the recommendation very very sound point there and clearly i 've been distracted so before we progress any further first i need a mover do i have a that 's counsellor heart do i have a secondar counsellor jury i take it there 's still no objections or clarifications so therefore if there 's no objections we will carry that 9.3 thank you for bringing that to my attention it 's one of those meetings where a bit of destruction is occurring the uh business of council has been finalized today so i 'll declare the meeting closed at 11 34. thank you very much for attendance [Music] [Music] you,"(-31.50373859999999, 116.3721711)"

those who forged the venue into what it is today the quarry amphitheatre is situated about five kilometres northwest of the centre of pers it 's on rebuild Hill in the town of Cambridge 500 acres of this area was granted to Henry Trick who was a recent immigrant and a builder he built a lot of the early buildings in Perth and the surrounding areas and he saw the advantages of the Tamala limestone which comes very close to the surface here making it easy to quarry limestone was a very important building material for the early buildings in Perth it was found before suitable supplies of clay were found to make bricks and therefore was the principal building material during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to Subiaco station via Joli Mont on a narrow gauge Light Railway made of wood limestone from this quarry ended up in many government buildings most of them on barracks Street including Perth Town Hall the old fire station the original post office now the state buildings Trinity Church the Royal arcade and newspaper house the business was very successful but in 1847 he sold it to Volta pad brie pad BRE continued to quarry limestone here right up until just about the outbreak of the first world war at its peak the quarry employed over 50 men the men worked in difficult conditions out in hot weather made even hotter when the lime kilns were roasting and so it would have been pretty unpleasant and probably not well-paid the quarry ceased working in 1906 the city of Perth then purchased the quarry in 1916 of course before European settlement this area was a hunting ground for the whadjuk noongar people who are the traditional custodians of this area bold Park was declared a nature reserve and in 1986 Diana Waldron together with her architect husband hit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 30th year it is well known throughout Perth for all of the entertainment that is put on here during the summer months I direct Perth City Ballet and I suppose our main idea was that the major theaters were out of our reach financially so we felt that if there was an amphitheater maybe the costs could come within our region one morning we read the first newspaper about someone wanting to use the old quarry next to the swimming pool and so I said to Ken my husband who was an architect well why can 't we have a quarry and face it I know exactly where there 's a quarry and we immediately knew what we wanted to do there [Music] the actual construction of the quarry was his design and in order to have the amphitheater constructed they obtained federal common law federal funding for employment grants and they employed immigrant workers ten was a wonderful architect and his ideas were just great they just worked so right from the beginning his idea was not to have straight seating all the way across you know but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in brick then he came back to me as a Diana we are going to make our own bricks he designed the mold for the concrete blocks so that they would all interlink and you didn 't need to have effectively a building license as I understand it but he was very ingenious but the men that worked there became very proud of the project as you can imagine and they loved working on it the amphitheater opened on November the 9th 1986 I think there must have been about 8 different groups on that opening night and that was wonderful [Music] [Applause] Diana and CEM Waldron whose brainchild this theater was were appointed caretakers for the first couple of years city of Perth then appointed the theatre trust to manage the venue the town of Cambridge was created in 1994 and continued to contract the management of the quarry amphitheater until 2009 when its management was taken in house belly wasn 't big at that time that was the beginning of dance in Western Australia Perth City Ballet has performed here for over 30 years since the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performing arts company has performed here for 23 consecutive years so I 've been through four editions of ballet the quarry and it 's not just a venue that there is such amazing atmosphere I don 't know it 's hard to explain but once when you are on stage at the quarry you feel the such a positive vibe we started our ballet school back in 2013 in the quarry for several years for our concerts I think what makes it unique is to have the crowd coming with the picnic and with the family and friends before the show you hear the the bottle and the glasses and the cheese and people having really lots of fun before the show and then also doing the show I 've never seen that at any places where I 've been before in the last 10 years it has also become popular for weddings and corporate events 20 to 30 of them per annum because of its unique and intimate setting so our main season runs from November through to March either side of that we have private events like weddings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weather for an outdoor venue that 's all our performances during that season town of Cambridge have upgraded some of the significant infrastructure including the stage power lighting towers and own digital lighting and audio equipment as well as making the limestone Wiz safe [Music] I you know I became the conservation swen I was a farmer we moved from the Mallee up to Northwestern you South Wales and that 's when I began to realize just how diverse a bush is I don 't think it 's it 's it 's probably one of the most unique venues in the world you know just because you completely surrounded by natural limestone walls it 's a unique place and I think it puts people in a great mood [Music] although designed for Bali many popular national and international touring artists have performed in this space the Whitlam x ' the black sorrows john williamson james morrison paul kelly the 10 tenors all of these have performed here many times where a youth organisation so our musicians are aged between 14 and 25 and the idea is to give young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very best venues around Perth and in Australia when we get to tour yet it 's a very special very special venue and there 's nothing quite like it in person I 've never played in a venue like that so we really enjoy playing there firstly probably the first show I did here was my album launch back in 2007 but since then I 've appeared here in all sorts of formats it 's quite a large venue but it also has an intimate aspect to it as well we can really connect easily with the with the crowd we used to do Australia Day shows at the quarry and they were super fun and we 'd sing swing versions of Australian rock anthems and we did that for many many years make a difference Foundation have had annual concerts held at the quarry most of them have been around Valentine 's Day I 'm normally very fortunate to get to host these make difference concerts and and make these incredible performers and it 's just incredible standing on that stage and seeing the audience and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've often got a wine in hand and just standing on stage and looking out it 's just an amazing view the people that come here the atmosphere gets to them and they 're remarkably friendly and and I just love the way my music fits that whole scene and if it 's being surrounded by bush really the outdoor setting is just beautiful to see the music hear the music and then look out over the bush lamb is amazing being able to see the cuckoo birds in the afternoon come in and buy your sound checking in and and once that Sun Goes Down in summer it 's beautiful when you 're on stage performing you have these moments of just being unable to believe that you 're in such a beautiful place playing to such beautiful people I think when you come at night on a warm summer 's night and you 're sitting listening to a performance you find yourself gazing off into the distance and looking at the lights or looking at the trees or hearing a kookaburra it 's just unique to Perth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's absolute magic from a working limestone quarry to a unique performance base the quarry amphitheater has a rich and diverse history equally it has an exciting and promising future offering this boutique venue for all manner of different performances as it enters its next 30 years the quarry amphitheatre offers professional and amateur productions to create an amazing program of events during the year in this wonderfully boutique an intimate space hey hey hey hey it 's the quarry 's birthday the birthday party hi Kate soprano here wishing you at the for a ampitheatre a happy 30th anniversary good night guys I look forward to playing it to your beautiful Corazon happy Anniversary baby so well done the quarry 30 years [Music] you [Music],"(-31.9341754,

Leonard 's green and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on each of the character statements for these areas we will walk through and have a look at those areas and you can decide what you think so let 's get going our first stop today is muslin downtown this is the heart of the Muslim Park Town Centre where the majority of activity occurs comprises of glide straight and Sterling Highway one of the aims of the town centre plan is to retain as much character as possible even through redevelopment [Music] now it 's time to pause the video and can play the questions on your questionnaire [Music] one of the big bold proposals is to remove the traffic lights at Clyde Street and selling highway this would result in a left in left our only turn this will create a more pedestrian friendly environment and manage traffic a little bit better throughout the area now it 's time to pause the video and complete the questions on your questionnaire one of the main issues has come up in this project over the years is the access of pedestrians to the train station from guide street this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way using an integrated footbridge into a future redevelopment [Music] [Music] now it 's time to pause the video and complete the questions on your questionnaire [Music] this next proposal is probably the most contentious it 's proposing a new set of traffic lights a decent Leonard Street intersection this will create a full movement intersection where cars could turn left and right heading in and out of some lemon Street we understand that there may be some concerns and residents this is a long-term plan and will be further investigated as part of the movement strategy now it 's time to pause the video and can play the questions on your questionnaire this town centre place plan has identified an opportunity at Centenary Park in high-density environments public open space is very hard to come by this plan proposes to extend centenary Park in G equals born Street this would provide extra public open space in the area and provide an opportunity to redevelop the current Park [Music] now it 's time to pause the video and can play the questions on your questionnaire [Music] if we say on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great opportunity here for a temporary or a pop-up Piazza style development his transformation could be quite simple by raising the road platform installing some murals and maybe adding some festering lighting this will transform this space this portion of road would remain open to traffic during the week however should there be an event planned or some markets on the weekend this area could be closed off very easily and transformed into a Civic space great for people coming together [Music] now it 's time to pause the video and complete the questions on your questionnaire [Music] we 're now walking through the precinct known as Sentinel it 's green this area is characterized by large building setbacks very established landscaping and a wide open setting the character statement for sentence green is where parks meet the people modern apartment buildings in a garden setting do you agree with this statement all future development in this area will have to demonstrate that they have applied these principles local planning policy number 20 that 's currently being advertised has some draft guidelines for this area for your review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete the questions on your questionnaire [Music] with the potential for a new set of traffic lights at Sterling Highway and in an attempt to connect Cole 's better with the town

pedestrian environment [Music] now it 's time to pause the video and can play the questions on your questionnaire we 're now here in the beautiful precinct known as the village the character statement for the village is that it 's primarily residential and this precinct features character homes and newer dwellings that boast charming fine gardens where the old blends with the new between monument

gatherings and for other community users the character statement for the church precinct is this peaceful on cloud features distinguished ecclesiastical buildings among formal and community gardens

redevelopment of the site now it 's time to pause the video and can play the questions on your questionnaire [Music] the parkway is our final character precinct on our virtual walkabout today there is lots of activity that occurs in this area so a coordinated approach to development is required the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gateway to Muslim Park featuring bold elegant buildings that provide sleek modern spaces for office professionals and commercial activities what do you think about that statement now it 's time to pause the video and can play the questions on your questionnaire [Music] in the final leg of our walk about today we 're looking at the lane ways that connect the precincts together you can see here these lane ways are not very pedestrian-friendly coordinating the development of loanwords can be tricky but looking into a couple of little initiatives in the meantime can make big improvements we want to know what needs to happen here to make you use his connections more do you feel safe walking through those lane ways what kind of things could we do to make them safer now it 's time to pause the video and complete the questions on your questionnaire

Australia",1065,[Music] so my name is sarah croft and i 've been in the in pod headline for six years i 've been through breast cancer myself i was diagnosed last june but i guess i found the lump in march and just having all the testings mammograms everything it wasn 't actually until the 25th of june that i got diagnosed but i didn 't actually have surgery until august the 15th i think it was just more shock and denial i guess um this can 't happen to me it 's not in my family i think they 've got the wrong person and because it was sort of happening during covert going backwards and forth to perth having different testings done i got the news over the phone which was a little bit hard because that happened at work and my surgeon rang me up and said that you know he found six different cancers in my right breast and had to do a mastectomy so i sort of he kept talking and it was all my fault i didn 't hear anything he said after that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to process this now i 'll have i 'll talk to you later probably get back to in a couple of weeks um and he said sarah we don 't have time we have to do this within six weeks i said okay no worries i 'll talk to you in a couple of weeks time bye and it was literally probably two or three weeks after that when i picked the phone up and rang him to talk to him about it um and then my husband and i went to perth and sat down with him just to go through our options um but even so you just want you want someone to tell you what to do because i don 't know yeah you 're telling me this has happened but what do i do and if i leave it what 's going to happen okay maybe i 'll just leave it now i don 't want to play this game anymore so we did make a decision to do a double mastectomy at the time but then when i went down for the surgery i then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implants in but then i changed my mind and said i don 't want the implants if i 'm going to go through this i 'm going to have a tummy tuck as well and use my stomach to reconstruct my breasts so because that 's a much bigger surgery he couldn 't do it then i said i 'm available this saturday i 'm available next you know when do you want to do it um but then that 's a 16 hour surgery with three surgeons with three plastic surgeons so and they only do those on a saturday so then i had to wait another couple of weeks until the 15th of august to go and have that done but in the meantime i 'd spoken to my girlfriend back in over east who had had something similar and because i knew she would tell me straight sarah this is what you 've got to do this is what i had done so i rang her and she said right you 're going to do this this and this and after that i felt comfortable with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm happy with that now i guess the surgery happened which i was in hospital for 11 days um and then a month of recovery and then i 've just had some more reconstructive surgery as well so i 'm really at the end of my journey um it 's hard because with covered my family couldn 't be here we 're from wollongong and so mum and dad husbands mum and dad very hard for them to accept and you know they 're wanting questions answered too why why is this happening to you um it 's not in our family it 's like i don 't know why but it is what it is and i 've been dealt the cards and i 've just got to just got to do it you just got to face it and do it and once it 's done you know i 'm not the only one that 's been through it other people have been through it too and there 's always people to talk to um jill was always here if i needed someone to talk to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just amazing whatever i wanted whatever i needed anything for the kids they were there 100 but yeah very hard for family to accept because they can 't get over here and they 're still trying to get over here so they couldn 't visit in the hospital and everything um which was hard too i think now life is so sure i am living my best life i 'm not gonna let anything get me down and even though i did have to take a lot of time off work to recover they were just amazing um nothing was a bobber but i think moving forward now i 've come out the other end and with all the support around me there is no limitation probably nearly everyone 's touched in some way or form by a family member or a friend um i think checking yourself is really important as well because i never did that and it was just a coincidence that i found a love um so it 's so important that we do check regularly and the money 's coming to a great cause and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's i was lucky that they actually got all of my cancer so i 'm cancer-free so i was one of the lucky ones but some other people have to go through chemo um radiation you know and that 's ongoing so just by doing this the funding is going to go towards that for a lot of people which is going to help you,"(-20.981787, 118.4863963)"

5 public question time so item 5.1 um response to previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item two 5.2 is public question time which will now begin at 6 42 pm and i am going to commence by reading out some questions that have been submitted by members of our community before i turn to any other members of the public who are joining us tonight live in the meeting to see if they have questions to ask so the first question um is from rebecca rieger and that question is can i ask that council impose an immediate stop work order on the company that has been contracted to upgrade the monopole at 54 devenish street by the four major telecommunication companies immediately i 'm going to direct that question to the chief community planner ms martingood through the chair the works on the monopole have been investigated by planning staff and they 're defined as low impact under the telecommunications act and are exempt from the requirement of development approval so therefore there 's no legal basis upon which to issue a stop work order thank you thank you ms martin good the next questions that we have um come from ronda potter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan addressing a the shared desire of the town and local community for the mature trees within and surrounding the land to be retained and conserved and b ensuring that future development of the land is of a high quality design standard consistent with the wa planning commission 's stated reasoning for the modification that the future development of the sites may serve as a showcase of high quality medium density housing in accordance with the provisions of the wa planning commission 's draft medium density codes in relation to item 12.1 of the agenda first question what measures will be taken to have consistent oversight and engagement to ensure these points will be adhered to address that question to the chief community planning uh through the chair should the minister agree with the town 's recommendation for an ldp the local development plan the town will then proceed in drafting the ldp which would then be publicly advertised similar to a local planning policy thanks thank you and the next question also in relation to item 12.1 is there any opportunity for the local community and interested environmental groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the chair uh yes uh when the ldp is publicly advertised is when the time the community uh could be involved and also i failed to mention uh with the previous question any planning application received for the site will also be assessed against that ldp thank you thank you our next question um resubmitted comes from vince maxwell so the first question reads in reference to answers provided at the agenda briefing forum last week about the waste local law the acting chief operations officer advised that 350 infringements will only be issued against repeat offenders and that the town intended to use a three strikes policy can you please advise which specific causes in the waste local law makes reference to either repeat offenders or to a three strikes policy going to direct that question to the chief operations officer ms adams through the chair these are current practices adopted by council officers and they are not specifically mentioned in the standard local law thank you my next question uh from mr maxwell that i 'll read out says when a ratepayer or resident contacts the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have to call clean way clean away directly if cleanaway are managing all waste related complaints and inquiries why does the town need to employ additional staff direct that question to ms adams through the chair clearway do not manage all waste related complaints and inquiries part of the town 's waste contract with clean away includes provision of some customer service and there are no additional stock requested or specifically employed for waste collection thank you thank you and the final question from mr maxwell residents do not have a contract with clean away why is the town directing residents to speak with the town 's third party with whom they have no contractual relationship direct that question to ms adams through the chair there is a contact number in the waste and recycling guide and that 's for missed bin collections but all other queries should be directed to the town thank you thank you ms adams uh the next questions that have been pre-registered for tonight 's meeting which i will now read out come from steve walker regarding agenda item 12.2 transport strategy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victoria park finally admit that neighbouring local government authorities of the city of belmont and city of canning did not get referrals in 2021 requesting them to provide comment on your draft strategies direct that question to the chief community planner ms martin good uh through the chair the city of belmont and canning and city of perth were notified of the town 's preparation of the draft strategy and the public comment period in their involvement in the southeast corridor council alliance and the inner city working group thank you thank you next question please detail the date time and method that your claimed requests for comment on the draft 2021 transport strategy were made to the city of belmont city of canning and city of birth direct that question to ms martin good through the chair need to take that question on notice thank you we 'll take that question on notice uh next question from mr walker who exactly from city of canning got the coffee chat where an informal verbal request for comment on the town of victoria park draft 2021 transport strategy was asked again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair apologies you 'll need to take that on notice as well thank you thank you um those were all of the questions that were pre-submitted by members of the public so i do now understand for tonight 's meeting that we do have members of the community who have indicated a desire to join us electronically i 'm not sure if any of them are currently in the electronic meeting room or if they 're about to be admitted by our support person might inquire from ms bray uh any members of the community who registered to participate online in the electronic meeting room with us now yes we have three members of the public in the meeting room one member has their electronic hand up and i believe another one has already submitted their questions okay great in that case are lisa hollands you have some questions that you would like to ask please proceed uh miss hollins if you 're speaking we aren 't able to hear you at this stage i think you might have just unmuted your microphone but please proceed to ask your questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity of attending tonight 's meeting uh my first question how many events have been or are likely to be cancelled as a result of covert 19 and how much will the cost saving be to the rate payer and what will this saving be directed to in the future all right thank you miss hollins um i will direct your questions to the town 's chief community planner ms martin good uh through the chair in terms of the first question in terms of what future events will be cancelled the uh the anzac day ceremony is probably one that we haven 't cancelled that we 've modified in any we haven 't predicted any other future events uh to be cancelled yet but we do look at uh the situation in terms of covid on a case-by-case basis in terms of what the cost savings would be i would need to take that on notice thank you ms hollins did you have any other questions again ms hollands i 'm not sure if you can well i 'm hoping that you can hear me we can 't hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic hand is still raised so i 'm wanting to give you an opportunity if you have any further questions that you would like to ask you 'll need to unmute your microphone all right well we might proceed um and uh if ms holland 's um oh see miss hollands you appear now to have unmuted your microphone did you wish to ask any other questions yes i do mayor i 'm sorry but i got muted and then i couldn 't get it unmuted it 's a common problem uh miss hollands we all tend to have it we 're none of us super proficient with the electronic meetings but we understand there 's a bit of a time delay that 's why i wanted to give you some time uh before speaking so that other people would know what i was doing but please proceed now thank you mayor my second question i listened to last week 's agenda briefing forum and there were questions asked relating to the annual olympics meeting and risk assessment um you did not ask for proof of vaccination at the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandated for proof of vaccination as i understand it city of belmont asked for it at their annual electors meeting on the basis that ceo had to protect staff councillors and residents in their work environment so my question is on what basis has the town decided they will not enforce this and do they consider they are protecting their staff sufficiently in their work environment by not asking for it and did you take legal advice um to find out either way all right thank you i 'm going to direct your questions to the town 's manager of governance and strategy ms branovich thank you and to the chair um when the state emergency was declared in wa um the state government has mandated vaccinations for uh some premises um the administration building has not been mandated so therefore the town didn 't ask for vaccination records from any community members that were attending the annual elector 's meeting thank you thanks ms branovich i can also say ms hollands that if the town intended to require proof of vaccination from electors in order to attend the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of a decision made by the town or the implementation of a policy if there had been the implementation of a policy requiring that that would have required a period of consultation it then would have required steps like risk assessments and the like every local government is entitled to adopt their own policies or their own premises and as to the last part of your question with regards to steps taken to protect the town staff the town of victoria park 's council chamber is very small we were only able to accommodate a small number of people inside having regard to the fact that we were bound by public health directions for the wearing of masks indoors for the two square meter rule so we made sure that the seating arrangements were separated so there was a two square meter rule was hand sanitizer available at different places within the chamber and upon entry to the chamber it certainly was the case that everybody had to wear their mask for the duration of the meeting except while they were speaking um and there was separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community who attended that meeting and if recollection serves me right we had about 23 members of the community attend that meeting i hope that assists answering your questions so in other words you didn 't actually have to get legal advice about it or anything like that i just followed the state mandate which wasn 't applicable uh the the town has been uh obtaining legal advice um at various different points in time in relation to the state government 's legal requirements imposed as a result of coronavirus in terms of public health orders and the like so it 's been doing that as and when it needed to at different times and that information was then able to be utilized by us so uh we 'll now proceed to ask um if either of the other two uh people who 've joined us um tonight would like to ask questions uh jerry pruitt would you like to ask a question at tonight 's meeting no thank you thanks mr pruitt um elizabeth mcfarland would you like to ask a question tonight 's meeting no thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question time and at 6 58 pm and we will now move to the next item on our agenda which is public statement time so public statement time will now begin at 6 58 pm there are a number of statements to read out but i 'm going to break with the procedure that i used for public question time um and i 'm going to ask the people who have joined the meeting tonight online with us if they would like to uh make a statement before i read out some of the pre-submitted statements so going back to those we have in the meeting room can i please ask i think i 'll just do this one by one might be the easiest way to do it from our public participants i might go backwards ms mcfarlane would you like to make a statement tonight yes please so i play in the year 910 girls team at the vic park raiders unfortunately we can 't play our games at our club 's home round higgins park due to insufficient lighting as gills matches are played on friday nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at miranda ellenbrook ellenbrook queens park and over the past few years at curtin this year we were trying a new home ground in bentley we 'd really love to be able to play at home at higgins park we 've been on a mission to improve the lighting for many years our mission has been delayed whilst the future use of higgins park was debated throughout 2020 and stalled in 2021 the future of lights is now wrapped up in the higgins park master plan which may take many more years to unfold we understand that there are electrical works that need to be undertaken to upgrade the supply of electricity to the park as well as a detailed lighting design plan we ask you to please prioritize our lights and remove them from the scope of the master plan by treating them as a separate project as well as considering their inclusion in the 2022-2023 budget that 's all thank you ms mcfarlane we appreciate you taking the time out tonight to come and make that statement to us so well done um i 'll now ask mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us would you like to make a statement tonight 's meeting again no thank you thank you very much mr pruitt um and now go to ms hollands if you 're still in the electronic room would you like to make a statement no no thank you man i 'm right thank you miss hollins i would ask if you could please use the button to take down your electronic hand which remains up on the screen so that we can all currently see that thank you very grateful um so now go back to the remainder of public statement time which is statements that have been pre-submitted ahead of tonight 's meeting by other members of our community and i 'll now proceed to read them out one at a time the first one we have received is from rebecca rieger and she writes i asked the council right to the company and refuse that allow the upgrade to go ahead until they have addressed the motions that were raised about this particular upgrade and passed at the recent annual electors meeting despite saying that this upgrade isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed the construction of this tower and so council it appears can stop the upgrade and i 'm asking the council do this in writing online and many other very concerned ratepayers behalf next statement pre-submitted is from rhonda potter she writes i would like to make a statement about the proposed scheme amendment for the land along miller 's crossing it is disappointing to lose this precious public open space in carlisle whilst i acknowledge the developments of kulbati park and zone 2 in lathlan have improved our public open space seeing how busy these spaces are only emphasizes how in demand public open space is particularly in carlisle the areas in question here are not only used by people as a link between carlisle and lachlan it is also used by our birdlike particularly the carnabies as a link between curtin university and roosting sites in lathlan and belmont whilst i am pleased to see the conservation of mature trees in the development plan i am concerned that the town will lose control over such issues something that would not have happened if we owned this land with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recommendation seeking to create a balance with a the shared desire of the town and local community for the mature trees within and surrounding the land to be retained and conserved and b ensuring that future development of the land is of a high quality design standard consistent with the wa planning commission 's stated reasoning for the modification that the future development of the sites may serve as a showcase of high quality medium density housing in accordance with the provision of the wapc 's draft medium density codes i would hope that our councillors in town set up some tight standards around this that genuinely engage our community and interested parties including environmental and birdlife experts i have major concerns around the impact of any development here on our climate we are a town that have declared a climate change emergency we now need to put practical measures into place to protect our environment particularly the rising heat and how the eradication of trees and green spaces impact on these i would also like to address comments around the advantage of building high density here in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site although along the train line is not very close to train stations with future developments coming to carlisle and near oat street station we must have a balance of development versus open space whilst i appreciate comments around high density developments to address urban sprawl in the outer suburbs we must focus our town and focus on our town and be leaders in environmentally sustainable developments that create a balance between high quality housing and retaining mature trees and public open space it is also so important to keep our community up to date on what is happening in this space i hope that our elected members identify any gaps here in this item and address these with any amendments that ensure this precious green space is protected and any developments are of an extremely high standard the next statement is from steve walker regarding agenda item 12.2 transport strategy and parking management plan he writes i 've had valid real concerns some of that is played out during the november 2021 abf ocm and april 2021 abf question time as a reasonable person and in this case lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of victoria park officers could have emailed me directly at any time since the 16th of november 2021 ordinary council meeting to answer the questions queries posed in my 14-page submission five months later i 'm left with publicly raising some of them via april 2022 council meeting process if current town and victoria park offices were hesitant in publicly answering any of these questions then why not have avoided further public scrutiny by emailing me directly i would have kept most of the answers to myself there is an ongoing problem of larger and larger private vehicles proliferating on the streets of victoria park these big vehicles seem to flaunt road rules speed and increase dangers for pedestrians page 77 long-term cycling network need for primary route to connect centenary avenue by curtin university toward perth cbd suggest work with city of canning to the parking management plan document page 44 3.5 advocacy has two actions of advocate on behalf of the traveling public for more frequent public transport services and any route changes for bus services advocate for any proposed new bus routes to assist in transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public transport advocacy mechanism three to five years is very inappropriate page 32 travel mode shift actions if so then why low priority is stated on page 23 why the shepherd and road movement corridor i want to urge council members and residents to not fear an upgraded shepherd and road to its ultimate design the fact is the current state government and minister for transport is working towards this is partially acknowledged and noted by staff in the finalized transport strategy initiative number 29. the ultimate upgraded shepherd and road will prioritize public transport by using dedicated public transport lane in each direction this will encourage private vehicle users to mode shift onto buses safety will massively increase and new lighting and landscaping will be provided why trade-off pedestrian crashes cycles crashes vehicle crashes for delaying the transition of shepherd road into its ultimate six lane configuration there is nothing to fear this ongoing project needs more advocacy for support from council and the town of victoria park private vehicle traffic won 't be encouraged because the cross regional traffic is drawn to tonkin highway and orong road many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miller street shepard and road as a safety issue as of 2022 it appears a new third eatery has opened on that corner eatery site although i still don 't know do not know if it has been unsold leased or if main roads wa has acquired the site recently yet i say again if the wa state government owned that piece of land 197 shepparton road and the opposite piece of residential land 199 shepparton road it could better upgrade the intersection by placing the traffic signals on their final alignment why not be supportive of that solution than all

business plan 2022 to 2027 to the july 2022 ordinary council meeting can i call please for a mover and a seconder for this item still seeking a river uh moved councillor devereaux seconded councillor potter before i call upon the mover and the secondary i do wish to foreshadow that i have an amendment to make to this item noting that the mover does have the opportunity to have a right of reply but the seconder does not um i 'm just going to ask councillor deborah as the mover of this item did you wish to speak to it at this time and not at this time thank you vernon all right thank you um councillor potter as the second uh did you wish to speak to the item at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in that case i would like to move an amendment to this item the revised version of my amendment was shared with councillors by email only just before the meeting began that was to take into account some feedback um including from governance so all elected members should be able to see that from their email but i 'm going to proceed to deal with the amendment now if i can and i wonder if i could ask the minute secretary to please bring up the proposed amendment so the amendment i wish to move is to amend point two of the recommendation to read as follows adopts the alternative draft strategic community plan 2022-2032 attachment 11.3.1 as the new strategic community plan effective from 1 july 2022 subject to the inclusion of the following amendments the amendments are a number of them and i 've set them out by reference to the page numbers i 'll try to go through them very quickly uh on page two delete the first sentence under the heading our mission on the third page insert under the heading economic uh the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers to replace planning and activation also on the third page under the heading civic leadership delete the words governance and leadership and on that same page under the heading civic leadership insert the words accountability and good governance on page 20 delete the first sentence under the heading our mission on page 21 delete the sections entitled where we 're headed and our underlying principle delete those same sections on page 25 further on page 25 insert under the heading economic uh the following uh new community priority attracting businesses and people to local activity centers through place planning and activation and create a matching narrative for this goal including reference to the economic development strategy place plans local planning strategy event strategy investment park perspectives transport strategy and parking management plan on page 26 delete the sections entitled where we 're headed in our underlying principle page 32 delete the words bracket from 2022 wherever they appear page 33 delete the sections entitled where we 're headed in our underlying principle page 35 insert under related strategies the following additional references community charter customer service charter disability access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership and insert the heading accountability and good governance and on page 37 before part 4 insert the town 's objectives section in its entirety as it appears at pages 33 to of attachment 11.3.2 proposed strategic community plan 2022-2023 2034 um to the agenda report pure uh the reason i am uh moving this amendment is the alternate draft alternative drafts strategic community plan 2022-2032 creates a mission explicitly based on the four pillars of sustainability in recognition of the importance our community placed during big vision on sustainability as the lens through which their priorities and the town 's objectives should be viewed there is some need for finessing of the way in which the pillars of sustainability in the current strategic community plan have been integrated into the alternative draft strategic community plan these amendments are comprehensively set out [Music] in this motion and they are intended to improve the readability and flow of the document the officers report argues that the change in the town 's mission from leaders in unlocking potential to the existing four pillars of sustainability meant that the proposed town 's objectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council made no resolution requesting removal of the town 's objectives from the draft alternative strategic community plan on any reading of the proposed town 's objectives they are readily able to be seen as aligned with and related to the four pillars of sustainability and they should be included there is no substantive change in the town 's strategic direction in my view from the proposed strategic community plan presented at the council meeting on 15 march and the alternative draft strategic community plan presented on the 5th of april such that the new strategic community plan can proceed to be adopted that is an outline of both my proposed amendment and also my reasons for it can i seek please a second up for my amendment please seconded counselor hamer i don 't wish to speak any further as the mover of this amendment um councillor hamer i 'm going to ask you if you would like to speak as the seconder of my amendment motion before i go to council alessandro who has her hand up so councillor homer did you wish to speak to the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ah thank you councillor homer um counselor sandro you have your hand up um did you wish to ask a question or are you wanting to speak on the motion thank you nathan and i 'm wishing to ask a question in relation to 20 page 25 of 40 and the matching narratives included the reference is there any consideration of including the urban forest strategy as this policy or the strategy does have examples internationally where trees do create value and increase economic activity in areas i 'm just wondering whether you would consider putting that in the matching narratives as one of the strategies that would inform economic development thank you thank you counselor sandro so if i understood you correctly you 're referring to page 25 of 40 of attachment 11.3.1 is that right we can 't hear you counselor sandra you 're still on mute sorry thank you vernon um yes just in relation to the second dot point where you um asked to insert in the heading economic and the second dot point says create matching narratives for this goal referring reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wondering whether the urban forest strategy could be included in in that as there are international case studies outlining that urban forests and trees do add economic economically to town centres etc okay uh i see your point for 25. so the intention behind the description of the new priority attracting businesses and people to local activity centers through place planning and activation is it is your question about wanting to include the urban forest strategy specifically because you consider the urban forest strategy relates to place planning and activation uh thank you mayor vernon my question just relates whether it can be a matching narrative in terms of the second dot point um because it is they 're referring to strategies and plans so it 's just in inclusion as a strategy so that matching narrative particularly given that there is international evidence saying that inclusion of trees and grading green infrastructure provides for increased economic output thank you thanks counselor sandro um certainly my uh amendment motion you will note with regards to page 25 refers to the creating of a matching narrative which would be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desktop version of this document i 'm more than content to see a reference to the urban forest strategy be considered for inclusion i listed an inclusion not to be exhaustive but to try and refer to those strategies that i could think of that particularly spoke to me about this particular priority but if you 're asking me if i would add the words in urban forest strategy into that second bullet point i 'm happy to do that um assuming that councillor haimer as a seconder is happy to see that incorporated um councillor homer would you be happy for that to be the case yes that 's fine if it 's added to the list of strategies and plans sure thank you so i 'm more than happy for that to be the case um ms horner as minute secretary are you able to add those words into or do you need me to resend the document through to you ah thank you so that 's the answer to that counselor sandro did you have any further questions you still have your electronic hand up yes thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to um the page 20 uh delete a page 20 of 40 and where it states deletion delete the first sentence under the heading our mission i 'm just wondering um whether there is a possibility to keep that sentence there and have a colon and refer back to the economic social economic environment and civic leadership examples and those being our mission and that that first sentence becomes a preamble the reason being is that that sentence reads we will communicate with empower and support the community and promote social economic and environmentally sustainable sustainability to create our vision and if there was a colon there it would then refer to those for pillars of sustainability i just think that um i really like the fact that we 're referring to the community and empowering the community so i 'm just wondering what your thoughts are in relation to retaining that sentence thank you uh thanks councillor sandra and thanks for raising the issue with me i guess when i was preparing the amendment i looked to the fact that the strategic community plan proposal now has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustainably serve empower and connect community so i was mindful of that um that that purpose um is a part of the draft alternative strategic community plan that i 'm proposing and i was trying to avoid what i would call unnecessary duplication between the different foundational pillars or principles of the strategic community plan so in other words trying to make sure there was a clear separation between the vision the purpose the values and the mission and i sense that that first sentence under the heading of our mission which certainly is in the existing strategic community plan was more of a narrative statement and it didn 't add to particularly nor did it detract from if it wasn 't there the four pillars of sustainability so that 's the rationale that i applied to it um all i can say now is you 've heard my answer about that do you have any further questions that you would want to ask me i guess thank you just in relation to that if that first sentence could be reworded to refer to the four pillars of sustainability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's i just i 'm just concerned that there 's nothing leading into those four those four points being the social economic environment and civic leadership i just feel that there needs to be something there that then leads on to those uh as a as a as our mission and our vision thank you thanks council sandro um it is a very valid point um i think that i would probably be um very open to changing that sentence so that we didn 't end up with the repetition of communicating empowering and supporting the community as appears in the purpose and perhaps the mission would be um able to be wordsmithed to indicate um that we would um um perhaps to uh certainly put me on the spot counselor sandro i 'm trying to come up with a neat sentence but it might be something along the lines of we will [Music] facilitate our mission um by promoting the four pillars of sustainability as follows and then it could read social economic environment civic leadership does something like that sound like it might appeal to what you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that would be something that i would like to see i 'm just wondering whether it would be prudent to move a procedural motion to allow our members to speak twice so we can nut out this if you think that 's i 'm appropriate i 'm happy for that to be the case counselor sandro if you wish to move that procedural motion please proceed to do so uh yes can i um move a procedural motion to allow elected members to speak to this item i can 't remember exactly the exact number of my apologies that 's all right so um counselor sandro would like to move a procedural motion to suspend clause 50 of the meeting procedures local law rule against speaking twice yes or have ms horner prepare that there you are that it be suspended for well not for the duration of the meeting for the duration of this item might be well more like it so ms i 'm able to remove the bit about duration of the meeting from the procedural motion all right um that 's fine we can obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm happy to second that procedural motion is there any descent there being no dissent declare that carriage unanimously thank you um so now open the floor up to discussion uh of a more general nature so um obviously all elected members have heard councillor losandro 's questions my answers and her suggestion can i first gauge is there interest from elected members in pursuing this i 'm obviously seeing some nods and a couple of hands up who 've probably got questions so i think there 's probably enough interest for us to continue to discuss it uh councillor potter you were first up with your hand and then we 'll hear from councillor devereaux thank you marvin and look i was just going to suggest some words um to try and move it along and it was something like um our mission uh is to promote uh the four pillars of sustainability uh to create our vision being colon and then listing them that that that would be my suggestion but i 'm happy for others to do whatever they want to do okay thank you councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i quite i mean i basically would like to thank um council los sandro for the suggestion i i actually like the idea of the original bit under the mission being kept um but i 'm happy with the idea of tweaking as well um i think what would be good is to indicate a sense of the fact that the social economic environmental and civic leadership uh integrated together not separate elements um and so one tweak maybe two council of potter 's suggestion might be something like which i didn 't finish with a vision our vision or something like that is that right yeah in which case um perhaps our um integrating vision that includes or something like that so that it um brings those four elements together rather than seeing them as uh separate thanks or maybe even just that that brings together the social economic environment uh thanks councillor deborah are there any other councillors who would like to speak uh no on that basis um then we do need to look at settling on some words so um can i try and break this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see the words the four pillars of sustainability included in in that direct expression i think that is an indication of a yes so those words will definitely be in it taking counselor deveraux 's point um about using the words of inclusion rather than as follows so we 'd have the four pillars of sustainability um are people happy for that to be including and then there would be a colon and then each of the ones that are currently listed um still appear with the same narrative and description that they currently have so if that 's the case then we only need some words that go before the four pillars of sustainability including um so bearing in mind this is our mission um so this is what we want to this is what we want to do in order to achieve our vision so does everyone agree that we need to reference achieving our vision in the description of our mission yep um so uh counselor potter you had um suggested some words um at the outset that picked up some of these things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of where we start the sentence given that it appears that it will end with the words the four pillars of sustainability including and a colon and then each of those four that are listed so we just need to take it back to the very beginning so are there some words that you have a preference for and then i 'm going to hear from counselor if he 's probably been busy word smithing something himself uh i just took the words straight out of what was already on the page so i had we will promote the four pillars of sustainability um to create our vision and then including and then those words so on that basis your wording would read we will promote the four pillars of sustainability to create our vision including colon and then each of the four that are currently there um so counselor if um your contribution you are absolutely correct mev and i was sitting here word sniffing something um i i just thought maybe switching um counselor potter 's words around to reverse them might sound a little better perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sustainability including and if you prefer champion to promote that 's also kind of likely i adore that but there you go so it could be to achieve our vision we will champion the four pillars of sustainability including all right um thank you councillor if um is there anyone who would like to give their view about either counselor potter 's suggestion or counsellor art suggestion counselor potter i 'm happy to go with counselor i 've suggestion all the words are there they were good and i quite like champion so yeah whatever all right so that would read to achieve our vision we will champion the four pillars of sustainability including colon and then the four that are there um is there anyone else who would like to say anything about this sentence that 's being proposed deputy mayor anderson were you speaking if you were we can 't hear you nonsense i did have my hand up before you read the sentence just to say i agree with the words that counselor i had put forward okay great sorry i apologize i didn 't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else who has any um other contributions to what the sentence would look like before i go back to council los sandro who raised it in the first place note council sandro your thoughts on the sentence to achieve our vision we will champion the four pillars of sustainability including colon and then social economic environment and civic leadership thank you mayor vernon i 'm actually very happy with that and i think it flows and then provides a basis for those four areas so i think it 's prudent so i 'm very happy thank you oh my god sorry i 'm evan and you 're muted sorry i was partly talking to myself but i was bringing up my original amendment motion so that i could ask the minute secretary to help out um ms horner are you able to go to the part of my amendment motion the tabular part where it has page 20 of 40 delete the first sentence under the heading our mission that needs to stay but in the next column called addition we need to add something in and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it will read insert under the heading our mission colon and the words will read to achieve our vision comma we will champion the four pillars of sustainability including colon great uh thank you um so that has now included that as an addition so um i 'm content to accept that as an amendment to my amendment motion counselor homer um oh councillor hendricks you have your hand up yes thank you even the um why would you have the word including because you 've got the force so there 's nothing else to include well councillor hendricks that came from a suggestion from councillor devereaux that we not end the words with a colon and then leave the four sitting on their own he wanted to pick up the point about integration so including i understand where you 're coming from it sounds like including but it won 't have the words but not limited to um he 's trying to suggest and counselor deveraux will correct me if i 'm wrong that it is including those four points okay the other point councillor devereaux did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just tried to do i fear failing in that quest but uh i i was trying to say we can 't do one without the other so we want to include all four of those and that was that was what i was trying to achieve that 's that 's fine okay i 'm happy you 're happy with that the other thing too is it 's going to go on page two as well is it just on page 20. uh well councillor hendrix i was actually trying to have a look through um the document itself to see if it needed to be replicated in another place because councillor los angeles raised it with me in relation to page 20 but you are right that the actual document itself has this in more than one location um and the first location i think it appears in uh is page two as well and um i think that we would be looking at adding that in as well so if that 's what you wanted to raise to my attention it 's a valid point that it would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20. okay thank you all right thank you so um counselor sandro are you content with that that it would go on page two as well as page 20. yes um yes i was going to point that out also all right thank you so um if i could ask our minute secretary ms horner are you able to copy and paste what you just put in and put it into the addition column um for page two and you 've done it already uh efficiency thank you very much so i can now go to counselor homer are you happy to see that included in the amendment that you have seconded yes happy to proceed thank you thank you councillor hendricks you 've still got your electronic hand up um i really do need to make sure if there are more things elected members are seeking to have it added to this we do need to hit it all in one go no all right so um we 've got to the point where now the amendment motion has been moved and been seconded um i didn 't wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably just said something very brief before councillor lisandro put a hand up um to ask some questions but i 'm quite content that this is a collaborative effort that i think will refine and bring forward some important things that we 've all recognised about the pillars of sustainability and their importance for our focus going forward so i don 't wish to say anything further councillor hamer as the seconder of the amendment motion do you wish to speak to the amendment uh nothing from me thank you vernon we can carry on uh thank you um so uh is there any dissent to the amendment no there being no dissent declare the amendment carried unanimously thank you so we now go back to the substantive motion as it was amended and in terms of the substantive motion as amended i need to go back now to the mover councillor devereaux you had indicated you didn 't wish to be heard at the outset do you wish to be heard now as the mover just very briefly uh merv vernon but i i think this is a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mooted previously as important to really stress the element of sustainability in our community plan and i 'm very happy to see those changes that we 've made to to help do that um so on that basis i uh i 'm glad thank you thank you councillor devereaux um councillor potter is the seconder of the substantive item do you wish to be heard no thank you thanks very much councillor potter is there any dissent councillor haimer sorry nothing from me thank you very much sorry counselor homer when you disappear from the screen i don 't know if you 've gone for a long time or a short time and when we 're at crunch time for voting i do need to know that you 're in the electronic room so if you 're going to need to leave i perhaps might say this for the benefit of all elected members if you 're going to need to leave for a particular reason you will probably need to let me know so that i know whether i 'm counting you in or out at voting time so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any dissent no there being no dissent i declare that carried unanimously thank you and thank you to all elected members for your contributions to this matter i 'm fairly certain we will be enjoying our new strategic community plan documents soon enough thank you so we now get to move on to the next item that is not already dealt with by way of exception resolution and that item is we 'll now move on to item 12 the chief community planner reports uh item 12.1 is modified amendment number 56 to the town planning scheme number one residential density up coding miller 's crossing carlyle i would wish to move an alternate motion to be tested in advance of the officer 's recommendation for this item so uh the alternate motion that i wish to test has been circulated amongst elected members and i 'm now going to take the opportunity to read my alternate motion my alternate motion is as follows that council one continues to support the original intention of amendment number 56 for lots 1003 and 1004 rally street carlisle and lot 1005 bishopsgate street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks and recreation two request the mayor and the chief executive officer to advocate to the minister for planning and the member for victoria park for miller 's crossing to be reserved as parks and recreation and three request the chief executive officer to report to council by july 2022 as to the progress of that advocacy now going to outline my reasons and they are as follows in march 2022 the city of melville with assistance from local mps successfully persuaded the minister for planning to reserve to reverse her decision to require 13 small parks within the city to be rezoned as residential and to agree to their rezoning as public open space in response to strong community support for the parks to remain amendment number 56 was originally intended to result in additional public open green space within carlisle specifically and the town more generally the local community has always supported and continues to support the retention of miller 's crossing as public open green space the public open space strategy 2019 assessed carlisle as having the least public open space in the town notwithstanding the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crossing the loss of any public open space in carlisle which has been enjoyed by the community for decades should be prevented wherever possible through rezoning in light of this recent decision in favor of the city of melville our council owes it to our community to make a final concerted effort to persuade the minister for planning to agree to the rezoning of miller 's crossing as parks and recreation we should also engage the new member for victoria park in the fight to rezone miller 's crossing for its obvious long-term environmental and social benefits for our whole community can i call please for a seconder or my alternate motion seconded counselor sandro so as the mover of the motion i will speak to this very briefly because i think my reasons have adequately addressed what i 'm putting forward i personally was on council when we went to the community with regards to a proposal presented to us by the wa planning commission that the town should purchase miller 's crossing that was against a backdrop of many years worth of attempts to have amendment number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current minister for planning unfortunately efforts to have amendment number 56 approved by ministers for planning past and present had not been successful and the proposal by the wa planning commission that the town could purchase this land did appear to be a opportunity that we could certainly look at unfortunately in my view the value that was placed on this land by the wa planning commission was the value of the land in the hands of a developer for residential purposes and the cost that was indicated was so significant over three and a half million dollars that ultimately after the town 's public open space strategy was finally adopted in 2019 officers presented a report to council recommending that the town not purchase miller 's crossing given the costs that have been indicated for that purchase now i am aware that at that time i voted in support of the officer 's recommendation that the town not purchase it i was of the view then and i remain of the view now that the town would have not been able to justify the expenditure in order to acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as parks and recreation and i know that that was a difficult decision for all elected members myself included i know that it was a difficult decision for some members of our community to hear and understand and accept and indeed i 'm sure there are members of our community who have not accepted that decision by council but it certainly is the case that the decision had to be made and it was made at the time the position that we 're now faced with which is clear from the officers report is that the wa planning commission has indicated a desire somewhat differently from previously to see this land rezoned not just um or not rezoned because it 's currently zoned residential but up zoned so in other words to have its density increased from r30 which is the usual density zoning for carlisle to r60 which is considerably more significant than r30 and my feeling is that if we were to accept the officer 's recommendation tonight we will have permanently sealed the fate of miller 's crossing it will be rezoned at r60 and there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the news that came to me at the end of march i think on the 31st of march it was reported in the media that the minister for planning had acceded to the submissions of the city of melville through their mayor and their local members of parliament that there was sufficient strong support within their community to not see some particular small parks uh re-zoned as residential and the resulting decision by the minister to change the position from previously and to agree that those parts could be rezoned as public open space meant that some 13 small parks within the city of melville were protected and would continue to be protected for the benefit of their community i feel like that 's an opportunity for us i feel like it 's not going to be without its challenges but we should jump on that opportunity we should engage with the local member for victoria park who wasn 't the member for victoria park the last time we made submissions to the minister about rezoning this land and i think we should try again to generate a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support one last effort to advocate on behalf of everyone for miller 's crossing to take its rightful place as one of the future parks and recreation zones in our town so that 's me councillor sandro as the seconder of the alternate do you wish to be heard yes thank you mad vermin um firstly i 'd like to thank uh thank you mayor vernon for um moving this alternate motion um i certainly campaigned and as i 've mentioned in my uh declaration of interest i do knocked and in my campaign i gathered a number of signatures asking for this part to be our this fellow 's crossing to be retained as parks and recreation so given the fact that it is a strategically located piece of property it does provide a future that if it can be retained as parks and rec recreation a green corridor within the town and importantly also an area that our endangered species the red tails and carnaby cockatoos can land on so that there are photographs of them landing on on miller 's crossing um also given the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not support um uh the amendment in relation to upzoning to r60 and their concerns and still pleading for um willis crossing to be retained as parks and recreation um i i you know when this item did come up in the april meeting um in 2020 i did vote against it and one of those reasons being is that i don 't think um given the lack of public open space in carlisle that um sumps ever would equate to what is potentially at miller 's crossing it is a really unique piece of land it provides a great opportunity for the town to provide further urban forest but more importantly it provides recreational buffers and reduces any potential urban heat island that could be created in developments um you know thick park has done a lot of the heavy lifting in relation to infill and we 'll probably continue to do that but i think that there are other areas that that can be done and particularly around the top areas such as the oak street boat streets train station so given given that and given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to the um lack of open space incarnate i 'm really pleased to see this amendment and i 'll be supporting this amendment and i 'd urge every elected member to consider supporting the alternate motion thank you uh thanks council sandro is there any elected member who wishes to speak against this item no um i 'm not going to do the usual call for dissent at this point in time are there any elected members who do wish to speak to the alternate motion um counselor i i 'll come back to your counselor sandra because i see you 've got an electronic hand up and you may actually want to ask some questions uh counsellor i first and deputy mayor anderson second and then councillor potter thank you vernon i 'll be very brief um i was very sad uh in the early 2020 when we voted on this issue um i have always wanted this to remain as park space and green space and the reason i voted with the officers recommendation two years ago was that i didn 't feel we could justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete uncertainty of the beginning of the covert 19 pandemic um so this opportunity to have another final push to try to keep this as green space is delightful and i 'm optimistic that we might be able to make some progress in this area so i am delighted to support this thank you thanks councillor eye deputy mayor anderson thank you meghan and i 'm just reflecting on the decision that was made originally a couple of years ago it was an australian challenging time not just the council but for community as well and i think this is such a golden opportunity for us and we need to grab it with both hands it may be challenging but we can 't let that go so i think um you know with what 's occurred with the city of melbourne and now that there 's a new member for victoria park so we just need to have that voice one more time and see what we actually can achieve so i 'm very happy to support this uh thank you deputy mayor anderson councillor potter thank you van and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote whether we were going to buy miller 's crossing or let it see it being turned into housing uh no one wanted to to vote not to buy it but also we couldn 't i i felt i couldn 't justify a three and a half million dollar um price bill price tag for that piece of land um and using the ratepayers money which could be used for so many other things at that point um i 'm really heartened by the decision of the city of melville um when when this was coming to us again i had kind of resigned myself to the fact that we couldn 't afford to buy it there 's no way we could get it we were stuck with whatever we were going to have to do and hopefully the um the plan would save some trees but i 'm really heartened by this decision in the city of mobile i 'm really hopeful that um we can get a similar decision for miller 's crossing it 's um it 's uh environmental uh importance is well documented its importance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got some really good arguments to go back to the minister with and hopefully this time we 'll get a positive decision we certainly can 't not give it another try so i 'll be certainly supporting this alternate motion thanks councillor potter um is there anyone else who wanted to speak on the item before i go back to council sandra who 's got some questions no all right um council sandro you have um questions yes thank you mayor vernon my question just relates to um the obviously the city of melbourne and what land area that those 13 parks would be equivalent to um compared to miller 's crossing and i know that this will probably have to be taken on notice um but also just in relation to informing our community and whether our community will be informed of this council decision i 'm hoping well i know that we can inform them but i 'm wondering whether um there would be any avenue within the motion itself to allow for community to be able to be informed um that this is what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um to the minister and our local member as well so i 'm just wanting to know if there 's consideration to do that thank you thanks councillor sandro did you want me to pose your question about the size of the land in the city of melville to one of the staff because you indicated you thought it would be taken on notice but if if you don 't ask the question and i don 't pose it to someone who then asks to take it on notice it won 't get taken on notice is that something that you are wanting to follow up on or is that not sufficiently material tonight to your decision about the alternate motion and we can perhaps gather that information separately on another occasion it 's probably not material for this decision but i think it is important in relation to looking at advocacy and kind of arguing the case to the minister um to know what though what that land area is um in relation to those 13 parks well what i can say council sandro is that it was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceo to engage in that advocacy is that i 'll be reaching out to meet with the mayor of the city of melville um to walk through with him what they did what steps they took to secure their strong community push and how they rallied their local members of parliament to get behind the matter i am aware that one of the local mps did an online petition that garnered support from the community and obviously you need to be able to secure a local member of parliament who will conduct such a petition um and uh certainly all of those can be aspects of the advocacy that we would engage in um and i certainly wouldn 't intend on leaving any stone unturned and that would include knowing uh the comparisons between our miller 's crossing and the land that the city of melville was fighting for in terms of its comparative size its location its potential uses etc etc so i don 't know if that helps you on that point but on your other point about how the community could become aware of this um as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the community are aware that after council meetings as mayor i do do post council meeting videos um we 're scheduled to do that filming later this week that is a great opportunity for me to talk with the town 's communication staff about decisions that are made tonight that we might wish to promote to the community and so i would certainly be expecting that this particular item would be one that would be included in the post council meeting briefing update for the community i 'm not sure if that information helps you or you 'd like me to direct that question to one of the staff now that information is sufficient just my last question just relates to obviously advocacy um and the importance of this site whether that uh the importance environmentally for this site whether it be for urban heat island and also for laura and fauna so particularly are endangered um red cockatoos uh red tail cockatoos and carnabies whether that will be um kind of part of the advocacy and that 's my problem my last question thank you uh council sandro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is included in our advocacy in support of why we wish to retain millan 's crossing as parks and recreation again no stone unturned and i welcome elected members giving me all of their suggestions for what should be included in that advocacy um post this meeting if that helps councillor devaro you have a question uh yes may vernon if i may um and and i 'm very supportive obviously of the idea of being able to retain this as green space that would be wonderful if it 's possible my question relates a little bit to our opportunity to advocate for the space on environmental grounds and just whether because i know on the tree and site feature survey i don 't think i saw a species level of documentation but i wonder if i 've missed something and if we do actually know what the species are in question because i think that would certainly help our case in terms of biodiversity corridor and so on thanks thank you councillor devereaux i 'm going to direct that question to our chief community planner ms martin good do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miller 's crossing uh through the chair i need to take that on notice thank you thank you we 'll take that on notice and counselor deborah that will ensure there is a written then answer that follows up because it 's been taken on notice was there anything else that you wanted to ask ah sorry it wasn 't just about wildlife it was actually also about tree species which would be quite significant for the potential biodiversity birds and so on so yeah i don 't think that was captured in the question but i think that 's a really okay information to know thanks uh thank you uh ms martin good do we have any details about tree species on miller 's crossing uh through the chair i would suspect so because looking at uh attachment uh 12 point 1.3 there is a list of tree numbers the diameter height photo id it 's not including the intestine but i suspect there will be some species analysis i don 't have that with me but i suspect it will be easy to get thank you ms martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's taken on notice um that it is to include a request for details that we have tree species on site thank you um i do have a couple of questions for the administration that i think elected members will be interested in hearing about before we conclude and move to voting on this matter um so my question is if we proceed with the alternate motion and we engage in this advocacy is it open to the minister for planning to make a determination to proceed with the residential r60 zone without further recommendation from the town or council ms martin good uh through the chair yes it is open to the minister to make a determination notwithstanding what the town 's advocacy is uh thank you that leads to my next question um would it be the town 's recommendation that my alternate motion includes a fourth point providing for the circumstances should the minister for planning determine to proceed with the residential r-60 zone that would include the requirement currently appearing in the office 's recommendation regarding the inclusion of a local development plan ms martin good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include a point four uh to include the local development plan in case the minister makes a determination contrary to the town 's recommendation it 's quite similar to the approach taken with jdap or stat matters where a local government will provide what 's called without prejudice conditions which means conditions that are not necessarily consistent with the recommendation but are to use a colloquial term hedging the town 's bets in case the town 's advocacy position is not supported by the minister thank you thank you ms martin good in light of your answers um i am going to um propose an additional 0.4 be included in my alternate motion and i 'll be seeking the seconder 's approval for that um so governance i think may have access to this because it came in separate advice to me um so i 'd be seeking to add a further point four which would say should the minister for planning determine to proceed with the residential r60 zone currently proposed to also support following modification and the words now appear on the screen which is a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdivision and development of an r-60s owned land at miller 's crossing in the same terms as it appears in the current officer recommendation so for the benefit of elected members this the reason i 'd be proposing to now include this in my alternate is that it 's a backup plan so if we begin this advocacy and while we are taking the time to secure our meeting with the minister and progressing our advocacy if the minister has the power anyway to go ahead and make the decision without us if we do not advocate for the inclusion of the local development plan we will miss the opportunity of having a mechanism that addresses issues like vehicular access environmental sustainability land um landscaping buildings setbacks and importantly the retention and the conservation of those mature trees on site so that is um the wording of the addition to my alternate motion um i am now going to go to council los sandro to see if you 'd be prepared to have that incorporated into the alternate motion that you seconded thank you medven and i just have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.4 and the local development plan um i 'm wanting to know from the town offices in relation to if the minister were to proceed with the r60 zoning and were unsuccessful in arguing arguing that this remains parts and recreation um whether they whether it can be stated that for any tree that is removed that there is a replacement ratio of six to one as what occurred with the west coast eagles so i 'm just wanting to know if that can be included in this local the plan or whether that is something that is then done at a development application process thank you thanks counselor sandra i direct that question to ms martin good through the chair if the town would want to include such a provision the time to do it would be at the local development plan stage if you leave it to planning application stage there 's no head of power in which to enforce that when the planning application comes in so yes it would be the preference to include any provisions like that in the local development plan thank you uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response how would we proceed in relation to providing in point four that this be included oh i 'm not sure if you 're wait i 'm waiting to be preferred to me but i 'm happy to ask you sorry ms martin good um yes i i 've referred it to you yes thank you uh through the chair uh then i would recommend an amendment uh 2.4 uh stating that thank you um thank you um [Music] given that response from the town officer i 'm just wondering if you would be willing to include that in in the event that um the minister were to consider r60 and any subsequent development on this site that saw the loss of trees there would be a replacement ratio of six to one uh i 'm i 'm prepared to consider it counselor sandra i did want to get some more detail from ms martin good ms martin good with the proposal for paragraph four to be included in the alternate motion um where it says that if the minister were to rezone it at r60 we 'd be seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development plan then separately have to come to council for approval in the same way that it did for the national archives site on berwick street and is that the opportunity for us to set out what has to be included in the local development plan or not and then finally is council alessandro 's proposal about replacement of trees six for one entirely separate to the local development plan uh through the chair uh yes a local development plan um would come back to council so a local development plan is very similar to or is another word for either a guideline or a planning policy so council has to adopt them so it would come back if i could add if uh council were inclined to include some words about a replacement of six to one for trees my suggestion might be adding in brackets after landscaping which is in the third last line of point four including a replacement of one to six trees uh or something similar it may be as easy if that as that if you 'd like to take on those words thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you if you had any suggestion for wording and where it would appear if i can just follow up and ask another question if we were to do that with that replacement six for one it wouldn 't be on the same site would it because if it was developed at r60 uh and trees were removed i 'm not sure i could conceive of how we 'd be able to get six times as many trees as were removed back on the site plus the development does that make sense ms martin good uh yes through the chair uh yes it does make sense and from memory council alessandro asks a very similar question at i think it was abf and my response was it 's correct we couldn 't have uh all of those trees on site there 's not likely to be room but they could be replaced some of them could be replaced in the land that is in close proximity thank you okay thank you so i 've heard those answers i note that counselor sandro still has her hand up and now councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity to explore this so thanks councillor sandro for putting your hand down i haven 't yet got to the stage of incorporating this information in because i just want to make sure we get everyone to ask their questions counselor potter do you have some questions with regards to this either the extra paragraph 4 and or the discussion that 's just ensued with some answers to questions about tree retention and replacement yeah thank you man i 've just got some questions around the tree um the tree retention replacement sorry just choking on air um just our current planning policies for other um land which is owned by individuals uh and developed what is what is our what is our current policy around tree retention and replacement if um people are removing um existing trees from from their properties i understand what we what we did with the west coast eagles that was a separate that was a separate part of the lease agreement but what is our current policy that we have um with with um in our current planning policy with regards to tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ms martin good uh through the chair it 's not a six to one ratio it is it depends on many things so for instance it classifies trees as trees worthy of retention which is a particular circumference around the sorry diameter of the uh of the tree and it depends on the size of the lots uh and how many dwellings are being proposed so it 's not a straightforward sixes to one it depends on several factors uh so sorry that 's not it 's probably a straightforward answer it would apply thanks uh councillor potter um so if we if we tried to put a six to one ratio in this um in this extra point and it 's not in line with our other planning policies um is it likely that that could go to sat or something or that the minister could just disregard it and um do whatever they want with the treats are we are we are we better off having something that aligns to our current policies that we can show that that 's what our stance is with with tree retention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um history with that policy i direct that question to ms martin good uh through the chair in terms of going to sat over such a provision first of all there is no appeal against a minister 's decision uh relating to a scam amendment secondly if such a provision was included in a local development plan that is the town 's statutory document so the town wouldn 't appeal its own statuary document the only instance where that type of vision could be appealed is if it was imposed on a development approval we wouldn 't recommend that unless there is a statutory document that is the head of power to back that condition up counselor potter anything arising so i 'm just a little bit confused so what i i guess what i 'm trying to establish is um i i don 't want to put in uh a uh something sorry count councilor potter before before you go down that road because that 's starting to sound like an argument yeah i understand that point i i would like to see if you could focus it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist ms martin good uh with the local development plan that we 're proposing here should the minister wish to proceed or determine that she 'll proceed with the r-60 could the minister ignore our request for the inclusion of a local development plan through the chair yes that 's correct the minister could ignore that what would be the reasons why the minister would be minded to agree to the inclusion of a local development plan although that would be a question for the minister and rather me if i was to hypothesize i would think that the minister may agree for a local development plan because they do agree that there should be very specific provisions that apply to that site that go above and beyond what the standard r codes would allow for thank you okay thank you so then going back to councillor potter 's point um [Music] what is the disadvantage to the town if we included too prescriptive a level of replacement number of trees in this particular clause regarding the local development plan what 's the disadvantage to us in doing that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair uh that is an amazing question uh i would think that perhaps the disadvantage would be that the minister might say this is far too specific for a scheme amendment and then that detail should be sorted out at the local development plan stage so so remember if you look at the last sentence they 're very general about the requirements there is nothing specific in there so perhaps that may be what the minister might say in that a six to one ratio is entirely specific and perhaps more appropriate at the drafting of the local development plan stage rather than the scheme amendment thank you thank you my next follow-up question from that is this the local um the requirements of the local development plan would need to be met by the developer who purchased the land is that correct uh through the chair by anyone who develops the land so someone that develops the land may or may not be the purchaser okay so if it is the developer is in your in your opinion is the inclusion of a six to one ratio tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potential developer of the land through the chair possibly because it is relatively high uh and as uh council of potter said before it is not a six to one ratio is not consistent with what 's in the town 's current policy it is quite different i 'm not aware of any metropolitan local governments where there is a six to one ratio thank you thank you in your professional opinion what would be an adequate replacement ratio in line with the town 's current policies uh through the chat my answer would be a replacement ratio that is consistent with the town 's current planning policy is what i would recommend all right counselor potter you raised this line of questioning anything come out of that that you feel like still needs to be clarified they were the questions i was trying to find the words for thank you that 's fine counselor sandro um yes thank you just in relation to those responses i 'm comfortable kind of to wait until possibly the local development plan is done but i 'm wondering whether a general statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees but also have a question in relation to parking and traffic um that could be generated from both both from the developments through rutland avenue and also um raleigh street and i 'm wanting to know um given that it is an r60 if this were to go to r60 um whether the person purchasing in the developer would be required to do any type of traffic and parking management plan in relation because there is only one entry in exit into this area because it looks like there will be no entry point from um miller 's crossing or from roberts road and so there will be quite a lot of traffic to movement through rutland and raleigh thank you thanks councillor sandro ms martingood through the chair in terms of a requirement for any traffic or parking uh assessment or management that would normally be something that would be assessed at the local development plan stage so let 's argue make the argument that it 's zoned to r-60 uh the town prepares a local development plan what would what we would do would be to liaise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing what would be the maximum uh number of dwellings and a configuration of road and vehicle access we would seek advice from them as to whether they thought uh one whether the local traffic network could accommodate that increase in traffic and to whether they thought it was reasonable to actually request a parking or traffic management plan having a regard to uh the traffic that exists in the area and the capacity of the the traffic network thank you councillor sandro anything further uh no that that 's pretty much it in relation though to that going back to the ratios and the officers advice i 'm wondering whether then after landscaping it could include um provision to tree replacement in to be consistent with town policies so a general statement thank you thank you miss martin good um would it be your advice to us that we included such words or would it just be your advice that we included words along the lines of uh including replacement of trees generally without reference to the consistency with our policies how specific do you think we should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general statement about replacement for trees lost rather than it necessarily being consistent with the town 's policy i feel as though that may be perhaps a little bit too specific thank you council sandro would you be happy then if after the words landscaping it said bracket including replacement of trees lost yes i 'm happy with that thank you thank you miss horner are you able to add those words into the part about the local development plan after landscaping and before building please just repeat the into the center so you 'll be you 'll be inserting an open brackets including replacement of trees lost close bracket is not good is that acceptable oh through the chair yes thank you thank you just a moment that i 'll be back on the screen shortly thank you just checking where it needs to be inserted in the point please uh after the words landscaping in the third last line from the bottom and before the word building that starts the second last line from the bottom uh thank you miss horner i don 't know are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacement thank you all right um i 'm prepared to accept that um as part of the alternate motion counselor sandro are you content with that yes thank you melvin thank you is there any descent to the alternate motion no there being no dissent declare that carried unanimously thank you everybody for all of your assistance and your comments um and the assistance from town staff to get this matter put forward and over the line uh elected members uh i note that the time is now 8 30 8 p.m uh and in keeping with um our previous practices of having a break uh certainly when by the time we 've hit the two-hour mark i feel like there are still some matters that need to be dealt with on the agenda tonight so i think it is appropriate um that we look at taking a short break um do elect members have a preference for five minutes or ten minutes if you could just indicate somehow with your hands i 'm seeing a 10 a 10 a 10 there 's another 10 the 10s appear to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now going to take a short adjournment in this meeting ladies and gentlemen um so i 'm now going to move a motion that we adjourn the meeting for 10 minutes um from 8 40 p.m can i have a second to please for that procedural motion uh secondary counselor potter is there any descent there being no dissent declare that carriage unanimously thank you uh so we will now adjourn uh as we 're hitting the 840 mark um could i ask all elected members please to turn your cameras off and your microphones off and we will see you back here at 8 15 p.m for the remaining items in the agenda thank you all right everyone uh it 's 8 50 pm and we are back on board with the meeting so we 'll be proceeding on now to the next item on the agenda which is item 12.2 the transport strategy and parking management plan the recommendation is that council one notes the submissions received and adopts the transport strategy and parking management plan and two repeals the integrated movement and network strategy 2013 and parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a seconder for the recommendation still seeking a mover you 'll see him over so uh moved councillor sandro seconded councillor potter um councillor losandro as the mover of the motion do you wish to speak to the motion uh thank you mayor vernon um not at this present point in time but i do wish to move an amendment all right um thank you um councillor potter um i won 't come to you just at this stage then um to ask you i 'll um have counselor sandro outline her amendment yes thank you um the amendment reads that point one be amended as follows one notes the submissions received and adopts the transport strategy and parking management plan subject to the following amendments a the benefits of this project including improving road safety and travel times enhancing local connectivity and congesting and reducing congestion and noise on page 73 of the transport strategy revised as attached in 12.2.1 under the heading orong road plan study be removed and b the words draft concept plan to be added to the notation for figure 5.6 on page 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment is that this is a value statement and the current concept plan by main roads wa is still in still a draft and is yet to be set to advocate for by the council to the relevant state authorities also as stated on page 22 of the attachment 12.2.1.7 it outlines that the town still needs to assess issues of the impact of any future design and adjacent community also the concept design has not been finalized and any figure in the report may not reflect any future plans that are on road thank you uh thanks councillor sandro um could i call please for a seconder for councillor los angeles proposed amendment uh seconded councillor devereaux council alessandro do you wish to speak to your proposed amendment uh no i think i 've outlined my reasons as to why thank you thank you councillor devereaux as the seconder do you wish to speak to the proposed amendment uh thanks man vernon just um very briefly um to say i support this uh small um suggested amendment uh although i 'm for settling a amendment of my own after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think i don 't think there 's any need for this reference like that to the orang road situation thank you thanks councillor devereaux um i 'd like to ask a question about this proposed amendment from the administration what is the town 's position with regards to this proposal to remove one of these sentences and add some further words to ah a figure in the documents ms martin good uh through the chair uh don 't have any objection to those thank you thank you um is there any dissent to the proposed amendment by council sandro no there being no dissent to clear that carriage unanimously thank you council sandro councillor devereaux all right thanks man and i also wanted to propose an amendment to the um item yep please proceed thanks i just had a small amendment uh that was that came up last week at the agenda briefing forum when i asked about the title of the strategy and i wanted to amend point one of the current report to note the submissions received and adopts the transport strategy and parking management plan subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh thanks councillor deborah so looking at the um the amendment that 's just been carried which remains on the screen if that were now seen in light of the substantive amendment are you proposing that your amendment will be point c like where do you see your amendment sitting now that point one of the officers recommendation has had an amendment to it where do you wish your words to appear i hadn 't thought of it like that so you probably anticipated that you were going to be perhaps the only one making an amendment or going first to it um i suppose in the grand scheme of things um can i offer you this advice it 's probably not going to make a lot of difference because if the amendment is passed the effect of the amendment will take place in the various places in the document it needs to so you 're wanting to amend the title of the document but throughout the document there may be other references to the document and i assume you want the amended title to appear wherever the words appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have your amendment appear as now 0.1 c just for convenience sake um for the minute secretary so perhaps um if you have some thoughts about that let me know before i call for a second up so that they know what they 're second um if that works to have it as uh point c um okay and council deborah your proposed amendment has been shared with governance already so they should have a copy of it as it was as it was worded um i wonder if we get our minute secretary to bring that up please okay she 's been working on changing it for you so this would be that point one to the office 's recommendation which has now already been amended will contain those words 1c the strands transport strategy being renamed to the integrated transport strategy yeah great thank you all right um thank you um so can i call now please for a seconder for councillor devereaux 's amendment seconded counselor alessandro counsel devro did you want to speak more substantively to your amendment i didn 't have the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's okay vernon more than happy for you to do that thank you um so it was just um in the reason i suggested that i note the importance mentioned in the offices report on aligning with the document 's vision and improving clarity for the community the stated vision is to provide an integrated accessible and sustainable transport metric network which connects people to places and supports the town as a livable inner city community given this community my proposal is that the transport strategy title should say integrated transport strategy so that it can better convey the intent of that strategy vision to connect people to places and hence connect they will convey the integrating contribution that the strategy will bring to making the town more livable green socially and economically viable the other point in terms of reason was just that it would also give some continuity with the old strategy name but also be shorter and clearer clearer than the previous title which was integrated movement network strategy thank you thanks councillor devereaux councillor sandro is the seconder of the amendment do you wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissent there being no dissent to clear that carriage unanimously thank you so we 'll now go to the substantive recommendation as amended all right um so uh counselor sandro as the mover did you wish to be substantively heard on this recommendation no thank you thank you councillor potter as the seconder did you wish to be heard really briefly just to say really excited we 're finally moving this integrated transport strategy i think one of the earliest things i did when i came onto council was move the imns which was the integrated movement network strategy so the upgraded it 's uh is uh and and pmp um is is quite exciting to have those two moved into one strategy and to move forward into the future um with a new and upgraded plan thank you councillor potter um is there any dissent there being no dissent declare that carried unanimously thank you we now move on to item 12.4 given that item 12.3 has been dealt with by exception resolution item 12.4 is operating subsidies 2022 2023 round one and we need councillor lisandro to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i ask ms bray to confirm that councillor lasandro has left the electronic meeting room completely yes she has left thank you thank you so the recommendation uh is that council award three-year operating subsidy commencing one july 2022 to harold hawthorne 's senior citizens center and homes incorporated for 99 040 cash payment plus perth cpi applied for years 2 and 3 and in-kind 960 dollars per year um can i call please for a mover and a seconder of the recommendation uh moved myself mayor vernon seconded councillor potter um i don 't wish to be heard councillor potter do you wish to be heard no is there any dissent no there being no dissent declare that carriage unanimously thank you uh if we can now invite councillor losandro to rejoin the electronic meeting room please uh i can 't see council sandro ah she 's down the bottom but without a camera switched on there you go um thank you you 're back um all right so we 'll now be moving on to um subsequent items on the agenda um the next item that is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we moved to item 13 the chief operations officer reports and item 13.1 has been dealt with by way of exception resolution and i did think that item 13.2 had also been dealt with by way of exception resolution um ms horner can you confirm that 's the case 13.2 is investigation of a verge bomb system um i 'm just scrolling back now just straight notification it wasn 't included in methods of dealing with the gender business no it appears that it hasn 't been um so uh yeah it probably should have been in hindsight but never mind um all right so the recommendation for this item is that council one notes the findings associated with the potential introduction of a verge bond system two endorses the town 's preference that no verge bond system be introduced and three endorses the chief executive officer to put in place a more formal mechanism to detail a report on damage to infrastructure which may have occurred due to building or demolition activity or future consideration can i call please for a mover and seconder of that recommendation moved councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be heard no thank

regulations 1996 and two confirms the direct lodgment of payroll payments to the personal bank council employees student to regulation 13 of the local government financial management regulations 1996. can i call please for a mover and a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anderson councillor potter did you wish to be heard no thank you thank you deputy mayor anderson did you wish to be heard no thank you thank you is there any dissent counselor homer just a question i think deputy mayor anderson raised one at the abf about the the 16 000 for training did that get an essence uh deputy mayor anderson i think that um you received an answer to that is that correct yes it 's in the um further comments in the report should be that 's where i read it yep um councillor hamer is there anything arising from that um i can i can ask the like i can i can either read out what 's in the further comments to you or direct you to it uh nothing else thanks moving thank you so i 'll call again is there any dissent to this item no there being no dissent declare that carriage unanimously thank you so we now move on to item 15 which is the committee reports the first item that we have to deal with is 15.1 amendment policy 117 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amends policy 117 business grants to allow for emergency relief funding as per attachment one and two declares emergency relief is required for the purpose of the business grants program can i call please for a mover and a seconder or this recommendation still seeking a mover moved councillor devereaux seconded councillor homer councillor devereaux as the mover of the uh recommendations you wish to be heard no not at this time thanks moving thank you councillor homer as the seconder of the recommendation do you wish to be heard nothing from me thank you maven uh thank you uh is there anyone who wishes to speak against the officer recommendation i will speak against the officer recommendation as i said during the policy committee when this item was presented to policy committee i don 't support the officer recommendation for this amendment whilst i understand the intent was to create some flexibility into the business grants policy that would allow for emergency relief funding and for a current declaration of emergency relief uh i was not satisfied that emergency relief had been properly considered in the policy given that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as global pandemics further there was insufficient detail throughout the proposed amendment to the policy that would indicate the criteria that council should apply in order to determine whether there was sufficient circumstances that warranted a declaration that emergency relief would be required there was certainly in my view insufficient information in the office 's report to the policy committee justifying why council should now be recommended to declare that an emergency relief is required at this point in time there were also issues with how this could actually be achieved given that in august last year after the conclusion of the covert 19 action plan by the town of victoria park um determined that the business grants program that have been introduced as covet-specific covert business grants should now move to the development of more general grants policy which we did do and that that was designed to give greater flexibility to the business grants and not to tie them to the circumstances of the pandemic the problem is that in the report that was provided to council the officers were of the view that the micro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coveted action plan had been incredibly time consuming to operate on the part of the staff that it had only reached a certain number of people and that the question of the overall value and impact of making very small grants available in such a scenario of an emergency was perhaps not the best way forward and that developing a more fulsome and detailed business grants policy was the better way forward so we did do that we took that advice um the business grants policy 117 was uh developed and implemented by council last year and indeed the first round of business grants was dealt with by council towards the end of last year i remain unpersuaded that this type of amendment is needed i would prefer that we take some further steps to grow the business grants program into the future as a more useful and more universally accessible program for people rather than us seeing that we have some money left in the budget and we somehow declare that emergency relief is required for what purposes necessarily i wouldn 't know and then we proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with that and more work would be required i think to persuade council that this sort of amendment should be made so i won 't be supporting the officer 's recommendation on this occasion is there anyone who now wishes to speak in favor of the recommendation is there anyone who wishes to speak against council alessandro yes thank you vernon um i just want to reintegrate um the comments i made at policy committee and and that is that um i think um having an emergency relief policy should be a standalone policy that it should also if we were to pursue it needed much more further work and should also include elements of investigating what contributions could be done for community not just businesses residents and ratepayers so um on that basis i won 't be supporting this recommendation because i think that it kind of scrambles and and makes it it kind of muddies the water for a grants policy i think there should be a standalone relief policy emergency relief policy thank you thanks council sandro is there anyone who wishes to speak for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the recommendation to close the debate if there 's no one else who wishes to speak um i 'll call upon councillor devereaux as the mover of the recommendation do you wish to close the debate just very briefly i also felt like there was some confusion in bringing these two things together so i also had that doubt in my mind and i have some sympathy with the views of both the mayor and council los angeles thank you thanks councillor deveraux so now like to ask elected members to please vote on this matter uh declare the recommendation is lost unanimously uh we 'll now move on to the next item on the agenda which is um item 15.3 given that item 15.2 has already been dealt with by way of exception resolution item 15.3 is review of policy 404 fireworks management results of public consultation and the recommendation from the policy is that council adopt the amended policy 404 fireworks management as shown in attachment 5 subject to 5 separate and discrete amendments which should now be on the screen can i call please for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mover moved councillor sandro seconded councillor potter councillor sandro do you used to be heard as the mover uh thank you mayor vernon i wish to move an amendment to this item thank you all right thank you can you outline your amendment please yes thank you um i wish to know the following amendment that the officer 's recommendation be numbered one with the numbered points to be relabeled a to e and a new point to be added and that 0.2 reads that the ceo provides a report to council on possible ways to encourage alternatives to fireworks displays such as but not limited to light and drone shows to a future council concept forum on or prior to march 2023 and my reasoning being um that the towns are the office 's report has not fully explored and investigated other options to fireworks such as light and drone shows and it is unclear if the current fireworks policy can cover these types of shows or would or if it would require a separate policy this is especially timely as the city of perth and city of coburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these due to cost as well as community attitudes to new forms of celebration of events thank you thanks councillor sandro can i call please for a seconder for the proposed amendment still taking a second uh second ed councillor devereaux council sandro do you want to speak um further to your proposed amendment thank you mayor vernon just only to add um further that i think it timely given that the city of perth will downscale their fireworks um and that may provide us some opportunity to learn from that from their um processes but also just in terms of providing alternatives given that i don 't think that we have any policies that cover light or drone shows and it would be timely to have some type of report presented back to council through a concept forum to just highlight whether this should be a separate policy in itself not contained within the fireworks or whether it could be containing the fireworks that would be up to the town offices at the time so that 's all i 'll probably add thank you thanks councillor sandro councillor deborah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard oh yes thanks mayor vernon i just i wanted to start uh with it with a question because i think the note 21 of the officer 's report did say they would um conduct further research prior to the ordinary council meeting but i 'm assuming given the very short time that we had between the two meetings that was not possible but could i just check on that please uh yes thank you refer that question to the chief community planner ms martin good uh through the chair no there wasn 't an opportunity to research that in detail thank you thank you councillor deborah any further questions no further questions but um what 's going to speak to the uh if you 'd like to speak to the amendment yes please yes to the amendment yes um just to say i think um the fact that we don 't have um further information about the options i think the proposal to have this considered further particularly in the light of the city of coburn review from last year that looked at both the policy but also alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to consider alternatives as part of our policy and proposing that to proponents and i think uh councillor lesandro 's uh proposal to seek further information to help us consider that uh would be very helpful and also be very timely given uh both the coburn report and as council alessandro said there have been from the city of perth and others some queries about ongoing use of fireworks and so i think it 's timely to consider it but also in the light of our community strategic plan with its emphasis on sustainability thanks very much thank you councillor devereaux is there any dissent there being no dissent to clear that carriage unanimously thank you now go back to the substantive recommendation as amended counselor sandro as the mover did you wish to speak to the substantive amended recommendation sorry uh no thank you thank you councillor potter did you wish to speak to the recommendation no thank you thank you is there any dissent there being no dissent to clear that carriage unanimously thank you next item on our agenda for decision is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public consultation uh this item comes to us from the policy committee but it is an absolute majority which is why we 're dealing with it now the recommendation from the policy committee is that council one considers the submissions received in relation to the proposed town of victoria park amendment prescribed defenses local law 2022 and two makes the town of victoria park amendment prescribed defenses local law 2022 as shown in attachment one in accordance with section 3.12 of the local government act 1995. the purpose of this local law is to amend the schedule one of the town of victoria park activities on therapists and trading in therapies public places local law 2000 to reflect the correct clause numbers for items 32-44 and move to the penalty unit system in accordance with the town of victoria park penalty units local law 2021. the effect of this local law is to amend clause 9.4 and schedule one of the town of victoria park activities on thoroughfares and trading therapists and public places local law 2000 can i call please for a mover and a seconder of the recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor anderson councillor potter do you wish to be heard so thank you thank you deputy mayor anderson do you wish to be heard no thank you uh thank you is there any dissent there being no dissent to clear that carriage unanimously the next item for us to deal with is item 16 which is applications for leave of absence and so on this occasion we have two requests that are set out for leave of absence and they the recommendation is that council approved the leaves of absence for councillor hamer for the date of 2 august 2022 and mayor vernon for the dates of 3 may 25 may 2022 inclusive and i call police for a mover and a seconder for this recommendation still seeking a secondary thank you uh move to council apollo seconded councillor hendrix is there any dissent there being no dissent declare that carriage unanimously thank you our next item on the agenda is item 17 motion of which previous notice has been given um we have uh two motions in which previous notice have been given um the first one is noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have a motion that you wish to present on the table council 's consideration yes i do thank you miss would like me to read it out i would like you to read it out please and so read out your motion and then read out your reason and then i will call for a second can do my motion reads that council requests the chief executive officer one to run a survey to gather community input and feedback on what they are facing with covert 17 in 2022 and how the council can most appropriately support community groups businesses residents rate paid and electors so they can best support and encourage each other to be a resilient caring and inclusive community in the face of covert and the many pressures and stresses it has caused two seek to learn and implement any best practices of support to any businesses organization or community group that currently operates in the town third report back to cancel the findings and look at multiple recommendations to assist my reason in 2022 for the first time the town of victoria park is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain open without lockdowns while navigating the current restrictions and health advice that is my motion thank you councillor hamer can i call please for is there a seconder for this motion still seeking a second though uh seconded councillor devereaux councillor homer would you like to speak to your motion yes thank you vernon um just briefly i know it 's getting late um obviously i will be supporting this motion as it wears my name for many organizations the issues around covert has evolved from the threat of lockdowns to being replaced with isolation requirements the optimism of returning to normal when they developed a vaccine has been replaced with policing vaccine passports open borders has moved into community transmission this survey isn 't asking the council to do anything sport any action or even advocate it 's just ask questions and to listen i hope council will support this survey and give this topic more prominence than the limited scope of questions raised at a breakfast event back in february thank you thanks councillor homer councillor devereux as the seconder do you wish to be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did receive a petition in relation to covert mandates uh some time back um and there was some consideration of how that might be dealt with and i know at the recent electors meeting as well there was a number of people concerned about the impacts of covert that meant a number of electors raised concerns at that meeting of electors i think the covert pandemic has had an impact on all of our community and a number of emails and other questions that we 've received as counsellors has highlighted the level of polarization that the issue of covert has caused in different ways but also i i really recognize that the tiring impact on all of us uh of the covert situation over the last two years and i think uh there is a real value in hearing from all of the community not just businesses but from community groups um and the people in in all ways across our community to see uh how they 're feeling and how they feel the council might be able to respond in a supportive way in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants that have been a very helpful support i think and been appreciated but we haven 't canvassed the range of opportunities uh for supporting people right across our community to cope with this difficult pandemic that we 've all had to face and so i really value the suggestion from jesse iv canvassing of broad community attitudes to see how we might best support and respond to those and and just listen to the community about where they 're at thanks very much uh thanks councillor devereaux um councillor le sandro you have your hand up do you have questions or are you waiting to be able to speak to the motion thank you mad vernon uh yes i do have some questions i 'm just wanting some clarification um with point three report back to council the findings i 'm just wondering if um the administration would be able to provide some clarity as to when that would occur so whether that needs to be that particular point needs to be amended so that we do have a date and i 'm just wanting to know also um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific date in terms of reporting back to council thank you uh let 's ask the question first um direct that question to the chief community planner ms martin good uh through the chair without having spoken to the relevant staff it 'd be very difficult for me to give a precise answer if i was to give a very rough answer it would have to be sometime next financial year sorry that was sometime next financial year did you say or this financial year next financial year um i don 't think that 's going to be particularly helpful councilor sandro for you or councillor heyner to know when precisely in a 12-month window of time that hasn 't started yet um he should ask for the report to come back to council um [Music] so i take it we can 't advance that any further so council of sandro did you still wish to ask councillor homer a question about him amending potentially point three of his motion uh yes thank you vernon just in relation to the officer 's comments i 'm just interested to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said in relation to the next financial year that 's fine councillor haimer um obviously council sandro was hoping that she could fix the date after consultation with the staff and ask you to amend your motion to include a request for the report to come back to council by a certain date now that you 've heard the answer is there anything that you would wish to say about that yes i did recall the questions raised at the abf were around the time it would take for this survey to be done and that was four weeks and i questioned that so i 'm a bit confused of why it would push push out to a number of months to come back to council but um maybe there 's something i don 't know there ms martin good are you able to provide any broad considerations for the benefit of elected members as to um what would need to be done um before a report could come back so that even though you can 't tell us the timing we might be able to gain some insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 of the further comments section of this report talk about the approximate time to do the survey which includes procurement of the consultant is three months at an approximate cost of fifteen thousand dollars so if i was to estimate a time for that to come back in terms of uh the survey results to come back and for the town staff to formulate responses that would be a minimum of six months i.e the three months that stated in the report and at a minimum another three months for for staff to to formulate some options for council to consider via a report councillor homer or councillor sandro anything arising out of that i just wish i asked the report back in november it would have been uh well councillor heyma um we don 't try to make off-the-cuff comments um during the course of the meeting i 'm all meant do you have any specific questions that you would like to ask now that you are given that information that can help um towards advancing your emotion i think just to respond to counselor sandro 's question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm open to suggestions of what the wording would be to assist in in that which i don 't have any ideas all right thank you obviously it is your motion so you will get uh more opportunities if you want to ask questions and you will get to close the debate in due course um councillor los angeles do you have any questions arising um that are remaining or you about this item yes thank you vernon just in relation to the officer 's comment about three months and a further three months then i gather that would be six months from now would that be correct all right well we 'll ask ms martin good would that be three months from um today 's date or would that be three months from the start of the next financial year i would estimate uh six months from now so that would make october council sandra anything further uh given that response i 'm just wondering whether councillor hamer would consider asking for a report back to come back to council in october or november thank you i 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him have the opportunity to continue to consider that while i see if there are questions from other elected members in the meantime i do have a further question i was about to ask do you have further questions yes thank you just in relation to point two um it says seeks to learn and implement and any best practices um i 'm just wanting to know from um councillor haimer whether that would also mean whether those best practices would have costs attached to them is he seeking for that to be included in a report thank you counselor homer are you able to assist with councillor los angeles question we can 't hear you counselor homer you 're on mute sorry mispressed um i did choose wording that was open um because i don 't know the answers to the questions and i don 't know what the best practices are so i would have to leave that in the hands of the town staff to get back to me thank you um ms martin good with regards to point two um which requests the ceo seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any business organization or community group that currently operates in the town um are you able to give us your professional advice with regard to what type of time period would be necessary for the town to learn about best practices of support for businesses organizations or community groups currently operating in the town and how much time thereafter it will take to implement those best practices once having learned about them through the chair not knowing what the best practices are it would be impossible for me to give a time estimate on that all right um thank you can i follow up with another question then this is partly one of my own but partly to clarify and assist for other elected members um would you anticipate there would be some cost to the town in seeking to learn um and implement best practices of support to the parties listed uh through the te in terms of learning i don 't necessarily think there would be a cost associated that with that there may be a cost with implementing all right thank you um counselor potter you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions yeah thank you man um yeah i 'm just wondering with a whether some of these questions are already being asked of community groups particularly around best practices and what kind of support the town can give to them um yeah so if those questions are already being asked and if that sort of information is already being gathered in an in a different way uh ms martin good sorry i didn 't quite understand the question could you repeat that again yeah and one sorry i 'm wondering that if some of these questions around best practices and what sort of support the town can give is already being collected from community groups in maybe a different way through the chair we certainly talk to community groups and they recommend what they 're doing whether that is best practice that 's probably something that we would need to do more research on um are there any other questions from elected members about this item council alessandro yes thank you matt vernon i 'm just given the response from the officer to council potter 's question um and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the councillor homer would include um in point two six to learn uh research and implement or whether that needs to be included thank you it 's the research component thank you so you want that question directed to councillor heiner yes thank you councillor homer thank you very much yeah i 'm happy you would look at including the extra word research in point i 'd say learn and research are very similar and that 's that was needed to be put in that 's fine by me that 's well i don 't think that 's quite the way the question went counselor sandra wanted to know if you thought it should be included not whether you thought it could be included i don 't think it changes the meaning of that sentence at all but if it wants to capture research as opposed to learn i i interchangeable to me so i think that 's the answer counselor sandro was looking for because she did preface like she did end her question by saying or is that necessary so it 's really like i think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interchangeable so um that 's designed to inform council alessandro as to whether she should be asking you to amend your own motion so she now needs to think about your answer in that regard counselor i thank you mev um i have a question for um the staff given the information that is currently being collected by the economic development team um for an upcoming concept forum from community groups from other data that we have access to do the staff feel that this survey would tell us anything new i 'll direct that question to ms martin good through the chair not knowing what the questions would be really difficult for me to answer that question certainly the concept forum topics is going to give a good indication but without knowing and without having the expertise of how to write a survey uh potentially to look at the gaps depending on what comes out of the concept forum if if if a survey was to uh focus on the gaps that we 're not getting then yeah they could be very different from data sets potentially thanks ms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you able to elaborate from elected before elected members or would you like me to do that about the coming concept forum topic discussion about this through the chat i suspect you 'll be much more articulate than me about elaborating what the next uh what the concept forum topic is that i was mentioning thank you um thank you ms martin good can you just confirm that this is going to be discussed at concept forum in april this month yes that 's correct all right um so i 'll just assist elected members if i can very briefly so i had a detailed conversation earlier in the year with councillor devereaux i had a separate conversation with councillor hamer and that resulted in me putting in a concept forum request form which is now on the list for this month and if everyone just gives me one moment i 'll just bring up the concept forum topic oh that didn 't go to plan i opened up the one that it wasn 't and now i 'm trying to find the one that i did submit um ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept forum topic here that are not helpful at the moment um i don 't know uh ms horner um are you able to access the concept forum topic request that i submitted just a moment i 'll see if i can get it thank you um in the shortest terms possible um the request was for us to have a concept forum that would actually look at some economic data for the town with regards to the impact of covert 19 i 'm looking more broadly at some of the drivers of what 's been happening in the community and it does seem to create an opportunity for us as elected members to discuss what the town 's understanding is of what is happening in the broader community what the town has been doing particularly since covert 19 community transmission developed in wa earlier this year and also for us to have that kind of conversation that we once would have had in the covert 19 recovery working group about what types of things we could look at doing i know that the concept forum request form became quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devereaux about some avenues that should be put to the staff so that is what is essentially in that concept for a topic i suspect that it might cover some of the issues about support levels and what can be done like at the end of the process of inquiry but it wasn 't a concept forum that focused for example on conducting surveys within the community to gather the information it was to look at what other information does the town have available to at its fingertips because myself deputy mayor anderson and councillor i 've had the benefit of being on the covered recovery working group where monthly the town 's economic development staff and other staff would present to us on everything from google mobility data to commonwealth bank acquired information about spending patterns throughout the town and how for example purchasing was being quite responsive to what was happening in the economic environment as well as the social environment at the time foot traffic pedestrian counts we were looking at lots of data showing what was going on in the town and the town staff had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was quite useful we would always get that snapshot of what was going on but i take the point that was at a time when there was no community transmission in western australia so if that data was available back then to the town staff i was keen to see that that data might still be available to the town staff now and they might be able to interrogate that data and tell us what it tells us um since perhaps january this year um in the concept forum so that we could then discuss it miss horner did you have any luck i 'm afraid i 'm still tracking it down sorry all right okay uh might be in my emails um i just can 't tell you what well it should have had the topic heading concept forum request form so maybe i need to be scouring my own emails counselor deveraux i 'll ask for your question and i might have a chance to scale my emails while you look i 'll endeavor to make it a really long question to give you more time oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really long questions at this time no i won 't um my question was just given we do have an mou with curtin university and i wonder whether there 's ever been an experience of drawing on the expertise of for example masters students to give support this sort of research endeavor that might assist us in looking at innovative approaches to responding to the concerns of community and other stakeholders about covert thanks uh thanks councillor deveraux um ms martin good is that something that you can assist with uh yet through the chair we have on numerous occasions used not just master students but uh other types of students from curtin university from various disciplines none with a particular discipline relating to covid but certainly we are able to use that mou and have done uh in the past and are currently using that councillor deveraux um anything further arising out of that so given the positive experience that has been had in that space um would you consider it worth pursuing to complement the other suggestions that have been uh placed in the offices report around ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes it would be uh very logical to do that unfortunately elected members i 've had no luck whatsoever i 'm finding my email that was sent through requesting the concept forum topic so i can 't really advance that conversation any further but um we do need to bring this matter to a close so we haven 't actually heard any debate say for the mover and the secondary speaking to the item um counselor sandro you have your hand up do you have more questions uh just one question and that is directed to counselor heimer i 'm just giving all the comments and also in terms of the time frame of when this report could come back to council um would he be willing to seek to have a time frame given that it will be six months from now um to the october that october concept forum i 'm just wondering whether he would be willing to provide an amendment to his notice of motion thank you so there 's some time thanks councillor thank you uh yes thank you mayor vernon i can amend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned that that 's the time it 'll take if that 's the time it 'll take i don 't think having uh sorry councillor homer um just to interject to make this quick um the reason why that we the elected members are used to requesting town staff to provide reports by a set date is to keep that front of mind so it 's also a date that everyone can work towards it also pins a time for it to be ending up in a future agenda if you don 't specify time in your notice of motion the town staff will take whatever time they consider as appropriate but without further reference to you so if you wish to request that the report comes back by a set date it 's advantageous to include that from a governance perspective in your notice of motion so counselor sandro is obviously inviting you to do that the question is if you want to do it what date would you like to put in because it is your motion we only need to get agreement from the second that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time frame that you consider appropriate given the information you 've now got sure i 'm happy to lock in october or i can be more adventurous and look at maybe september but it 's really a matter for you councillor homer the questions have been asked we 've gained some information from the staff um you need to consider what you do with that sure well then no later than october and if earlier if possible yeah all right so um well the earlier if possible doesn 't need to be in the recommendation um so on that basis you 'd be looking to add the words in report back to council by october 2022 yep so the words by october means if they can do it sooner they will present it sooner than that but that 's the end date that you wish it to come back to council by then ms horner are you able to add those words into council lahaina 's notice of motion clarify whether he would like it in the middle there or at the end of the point thank you oh uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the words go in the middle or at the end i 'm keen to move on it 's ten o 'clock so yeah keen to move on as well thanks um so it 'll stay as it is now um is there anyone who who wishes to speak substantively to this motion either for or against who hasn 't spoken so far counselor i thank you may vernon um i 've listened with great interest to this because i agree that it 's good to ask questions and find out the impact on our community of things that are happening i 'm however really concerned that this would be giving us a report in six months time this is such a moving feast if you look at what covert has happened in the last what 's happened with covert in the last six months information collected six months ago would be um of questionable relevance now i actually think that it 's also premature to be passing this given that we are discussing what data is available and what information we do have at a concept forum um in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am impressed with um with council hamer 's intent with this i feel that it is um it 's probably not helpful until we know what data we already have collected which we 'll find out from the concept forum which would allow us to examine any gaps and then then we 're still talking about six months down the track at which point the relevance of the information would be could well be questionable so at this stage i don 't think i 'm willing to support this thanks thanks councillor is there anyone else who wishes to speak to the item uh councillor hendrix thank you mayor vernon um i have reservations myself a little bit because we 've only just entered this period with covert um covert 's probably going to be around for quite a while and different strains possibly um so we 've got to learn to live with it so um the fact it 's not here for six months or the early result won 't be there and and the fact you 're having a possible concept forum on a similar discussion um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing and also i mean with a look after our budget and i see this also recommended you 're going to put 110 000 aside for this as well so um that 's that to me is a big concern so in light of it all i mean i think it 's better to wait and i think the issues the town 's having or the communities having is because of the restrictions and mandates and i think we probably can do far better for the communities to advocate on those things as the um as it came out at the electors meeting so that 's just my opinion on that thank you thanks councillor hendrix council sandro yes thank you vernon um just given all the comments and i do take them on board um i will actually be supporting um this notice of motion i think you know having the argument that you know it 's going to be six months out of date you could say well you know the data that we 're going to receive at the april um you know concept forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected that could be also out of date the fact that it 's um going to be encompassing residents and ratepayers and electors i think that that 's really important to hear their views as to how covert has impacted on them um and it is just a it 's a report coming back to council and i think any data um collected be it whatever cycle whether you know we 've got you know future outbreaks or a different strain or whatever is really valuable to have our community be able to present how this you know pandemic has affected them so on that basis i will be supporting um the notice of motion thank you thanks counselor sandro councillor potter yeah thank you mevin um i won 't be supporting the motion um for many of the same reasons that council arrives stated um i think that it 's premature when we know that there 's a concept forum a topic on this this month um i 'm more interested in seeing what we 've already gathered and who we 've gathered it from and what that data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the holes are in that in the future and i am concerned that by just a survey to the community with not really anything targeted that we may be just asking the same a lot of the same people the same questions um and i think that that doubling up is a waste of towns resources so um i think that uh i 'll be waiting until after the concept forum before uh i 'll be looking at what what else we need to do and um and then we can make a more informed decision at that point uh thanks counselor product counselor sandro do you have a question to ask given that you have already spoken on this item yes i do have a question um i just wondering if councillor hamer would look to further amend his notice of motion to include the upcoming concept forum in april and whether that could be a consideration thank you uh council sandro that is effectively part of you speaking to this matter um you should have in my view reached out and have discussions with council homer about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week and it has been circulated amongst elected members for some time um so i 'm not going to invite councillor hama to answer that we really need to get this fairly straightforward matter dealt with look i 'm going to speak to the item and i 'll certainly give any other elected members who haven 't spoken an opportunity before inviting counselor home to close the debate um i 'm not going to support this item um i do understand councillor homer 's intent behind it i feel like that intent has come from a place of wishing to see something happen uh very quickly but there are a couple of things that are really important i 'm not persuaded that simply running a survey which undoubtedly would be an electronic online survey is going to actually secure useful data that can then inform action by the town because that 's what we do we don 't do surveys to find out about how people feel and how they 're responding so we can then do nothing with it the intention would be that we would need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey be a part of a project that the town decided that they would wish to run and that a survey would be one component of it and they would determine how to target such a survey and to whom they should target it um secondly i do accept um and councillor potter alluded to the fact that the town staff for some time have been participating through community development with regular meetings with community not-for-profit and service providers to the most vulnerable members of our community and those are round table forums hosted by those service providers and the town staff get to attend them and they were they 've been happening fairly regularly and they allow a good opportunity for the sharing of information about what 's going on particularly in that sector which is the support services sector the next thing is i 'm mindful of the fact that the town 's officer 's response to this notice of motion has been to say that they don 't support running such a survey but even that notwithstanding there are issues about the cost of doing this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take us i personally would much prefer to see us have an open conversation as an elected group about whether we would like to see the covert 19 recovery working group be reinstated and start looking at perhaps a potentially covert action plan number two we still do have a covert uh 19 recovery strategy called restart vic park and that strategy remains in place and it has all the necessary pillars to it or how we will move through covert all the way through to post the pandemic and how we can start to thrive so i prefer to see it followed through in that way as a logical consequence of the detailed and targeted manner in which we approach covet 19 when it first caused an immediate impact not only on our local community business and residential but also on the town 's provision of services now we 're in a different phase and perhaps that 's a better way to approach this i 'm also very concerned about point two in the notice of motion about seeking to learn and implement any best practices of support um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be something that the town can quite readily do either by talking to their colleagues and local government elsewhere doing as councillor devereaux says and utilizing um the great knowledge base at curtin university and students who are already quite active potentially in this field of gathering data and researching best practices and writing papers on them i agree that perhaps that can be done but the cost of implementing those sorts of best practices there would need to be an awful lot of work done before the town could ever bring that to council for endorsement and this motion says that we are to do just that without anything further we 're to seek to learn and go ahead and implement without anything more and to me that isn 't a proper governance approach to taking on projects that could be of enormous significance both in terms of their cost but also their resourcing so for a number of reasons i would prefer that we took a step back rather than trying to rush into surveying people and we do look and assess the outcomes that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then that we do start to focus on the gaps and i 'm just not convinced that a survey is the gap at the moment so for those reasons i won 't be supporting this motion is there anyone else who would like to speak to promotion if not i 'm going to go to council lahaina to close the debate council homer would you like to close the debate um and if you 're wishing to make any changes to the wording now is your time to do so thank you vernon um i do agree with a lot of your points and this does have its flaws and isn 't my first preference to move forward um i would mention that the cost was 15 000 which is higher than what i would like not 110 and the data we currently have is from 2020 and from a breakfast in february so there is an issue with data having an expo date that being said i don 't know what we would learn because i we haven 't learnt it yet so i am somewhat optimistic that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honestly don 't know um that 's all from me thanks thank you elected members if you could please now vote so i declare the motion lost those in favor of the motion councilor haimer councillor deborah and council sandro goes against the motion myself mayor vernon deputy mayor anderson councillor potter councillor hendricks and councillor um thanks councillor homer for bringing this to our attention these are always important conversations to have and yeah rest assured we will continue as a group to work on what we do for our community we now go to the next item on the agenda which is the next member notice of motion which is a notice of motion from myself so i 'll just indicate that my motion is as follows the council requests the ceo to list the following items for consideration in the draft annual budget 2022 2023 one higgins park flood lighting to the football ovals two road renewal at wall street local center areas from the end of the new revitalization works to extend through each round about to finish it off three cool body park removable shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enclosed dog exercise areas and fourthly aqualife removable shade sails for a portion of the outdoor swimming pool uh the reason for moving uh this motion is that firstly the existing flood lighting at higgins park is very old and it 's no longer working satisfactorily there is an underlying issue with the power supply to the whole park that does require intervention from western power and that will have a cost for the town that needs to be factored in new flood lighting for the oval football over is a feature of the master plan and de-scoping the delivery of that flood lighting should now be considered to see if it can be done in the 22-23 year at well street the residents have complained that the new local centre project looks unfinished in part because the road surface upgrade does finish before each roundabout starts at the either end of the project so extending the resurfacing through each roundabout to the other side would make the project look more complete kulbati park dog enclosed areas are very popular but there is a distinct lack of shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to produce really useful shade and aqualife shade sails over outdoor pools in my view is a necessity to prevent skin cancer so what i am seeking is a secondary please for my notice of motion sorry um i apologize i submitted to um the ceo after the beginning of the meeting a declaration of interest for this so i just wanted to put a declaration in now um thank you apologies i didn 't do it at the very beginning amazing i did about five minutes after you asked us to um i have had contact from members of the vic park raiders who use higgins park um advocating for flood lighting off those football ovals thank you thank you um that 's fine um i uh i 'm assuming that um council if you sent through you end up sending through your written declaration of interest and partiality for that item thank you council alessandro yes thank you melvin and i too wish to declare an uh declaration of interesting partiality as i 've been approached by um the park raiders in the past in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my declaration um this evening thank you thank you if you could send that through by the end of the night i appreciate that um so can i call please for oh a second is already there councillor hendricks has seconded um thank you as the mover i don 't wish to be heard um in any substantive way um the motion is merely to request these items to be listed for consideration whether or not they will end up passing um our scrutiny and meeting the criteria for inclusion in the uh budget for 2022 23 remains to be seen um so i 'm asking for these to be included since none of them are currently included in the draft budget developed to date um councillor hendricks as seconder would you like to speak yeah thank you mayor vernon um i 'm too very i 'm grateful that you put this forward particularly to do with the lighting that 's something i 've been sort of keeping a close eye on um and the fact that it was described i think like you say it 's given us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pleased that it 's something maybe can be done about it so yeah thank you for bringing this one through thanks councillor hendrix um is there any dissent counselor deborah uh yeah thanks mayor vernon um i won 't be supporting this motion i am i feel like we 've already been struggling over a long period with the budget for this year there 's a number of uh high priority issues that we 're struggling with already i feel like um pulling out specific additional ones at this stage that is the water for me um and so uh while i don 't uh negate to any extent the um the need for these things um i 'm conscious of the need of so many other things already on our uh budget list that we 're having to look at and consider and so um on that basis um i won 't be supporting this because i yeah i just feel like it 's um it 's too difficult to add more at this stage of the budget process um thanks thanks councillor devereaux is there anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor potter yeah thanks move and i 'm happy to support it um it 's probably different to councillor deborah as i 've been through the budget process i think 10 times now i 'm used to things going in coming out going in coming out something else goes in um i i don 't have a problem with things being put for consideration in the big scheme of things we 've still got a fair way to go um and we can easily pull these things out if um they don 't cut the mustard it when they 're put up against other things so i 'm happy for whatever to be considered thanks councillor potter is there anyone else who wishes to speak against no anyone else who wishes to speak note um then it falls to me to close the debate um councillor deborah i appreciate your reflections on how you see the process i take the view quite firmly that notices of motion to counsel are the right way for elected members to raise items for potential consideration in the budget not to be done as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we might like to see happen town staff now have presented us with drafts those drafts did not include any of these items and each of these items have come to my attention from members of our community who are desirous of seeing us to consider them and i think that that is the appropriate way for us to deal with it um could we potentially have seen my notice of motion a little earlier um possibly so um but at the end of the day it 's only been recently that we 've been digging into where we sit with the budget so i think like councillor potter there 's plenty of time for us to hear from the staff what each of these items might be worth and whether or not they have any priority town staff will give us advice about that and we can consider that i think every year there are endless amounts of items that will have priority for some and not for others and that is the joy the budget process and i 'm quite happy for these four items to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider that it 's only four more items um three of which are quite small in the scheme of things to potentially be considered by us for inclusion so can you all please now vote still waiting on a vote uh so somebody hasn 't voted correct are you happy for me to indicate who um i got it i got it come through if you 've got it then you don 't need to name names at this late stage of the night but all right uh so declare the motion carried uh those in favor myself man vernon deputy mayor anderson councillor hamer council of potter councillor hendricks councillor ife and councillor sandro those against councillor devereaux thank you elected members for your contributions to both the notices of motion tonight from elected members so we now move forward on our agenda which unfortunately we are not yet finished with um but i am mindful that we 're boxing towards um our second lot of two hours sitting um so we 'll see how we go from here as to when we might need to test your patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item on the agenda is item 18 which is questions from members without notice are there any questions from elected members without notice no there being no uh questions from members without notice we 'll move to the next item 19 new business of an urgent nature introduced by decision meeting we have none item 20 public question time uh do we have any members of the community still in the electronic meeting who wish to ask questions if so please raise your hand electronically that is ms bray do we have any members of the community who

you very much for the work you all put in so that that 's a great statement mr pruitt thank you so much for that that 's really nice to hear of what is coming towards the end of a long meeting so we appreciate it very much all right thank you that concludes public statement time item 22 is meeting close to the public in this instance we do have a matter for which the meeting needs to be closed to the public in these circumstances um i am going to first consult with my fellow elected members um given that we are almost at the two hour mark since we last had a break um and we do have a confidential item to go behind closed doors and move out of this meeting room and into another one do elected members want to have a break for a short period of time before we start that closed session no no one wants a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry to all the staff um who might be involved who are hoping that there might have been an opportunity for a break um and uh yes so we 're going to move forward on that basis so i now need to move a procedural motion that council one closes the meeting uh to the members of the public uh at 10 25 pm to consider item 22.1.1 in accordance with section 5.232 a of the local government act 1995 and secondly permits the chief executive officer the chief operations officer the manager property development and leasing the manager governance and strategy

additional impartiality for 13.5 i have attended events for one of the contenders in the confidential attachment thank you sorry councillor sandro you broke up right in the middle of that um i heard probably uh the first couple of words and then it faded away i think it might have been your movement away from the distance to your microphone potentially because i could see you moving and as you moved your voice went in and out you could perhaps say it again please for us yes thank you um i too wish to declare an impartiality for 13.5 as i have attended events for the for the applicant who is within the confidential attachment thank you uh thank you council alessandro we might just have to give you a gentle reminder if you 're speaking later on to keep your voices close to the microphone of your computer as you possibly can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there any other elected members who have a declaration of interest that they have not yet made councillor karimi i apologize i 'm having issues navigating with those streams um i too need to make a declaration for item 13.5 as i too have attended events by applicants on that matter um okay thank you councillor creamy i don 't know about other elected members but i also had some difficulty hearing some of what you have to say so i 'm not sure if this is a um [Music] ominous port end of bad things to come with our sound tonight but let 's hope not um so it 's item 13.5 for you counselor creamy it 's an impartiality interest and on the basis that you 've attended events um by one of the parties in the confidential attachment yes that is correct thank you um um suitably comfortable um our minute secretary ms noon have you managed to get all of that information recorded yes i have mayor burnham uh thank you are there any other elected members who still need to make a declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about that um and if you do have a declaration it needs to be made before the item comes before this forum however um it is certainly the case that we may not discuss all items at tonight 's agenda councillor ive sorry i too have the same declaration at 13.5 as having attended events for that same organization i 'll email it through right now thank you councillor i and can i say to all those councillors who have now declared an interest in tonight 's meeting you do need to submit your declaration of interest for the end of the meeting you can do that either by the online submission tool or you can do it by sending it through by email thank you we will now move on and proceed with the remainder of our agenda so we 're now at the stage where we 're about to begin public uh participation time and as i indicated at the outset we 'll be giving priority in terms of order to those people who pre-submitted questions and statements in advance before i call on any member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation option so um governance will be making a note of the time and will now commence public participation time at 6 47 p.m so there are a number of matters that have been pre-submitted we start with david wartly of black lane who has three questions and a number of statements regarding item 12.1 and i will read out his statements statement number one in relation to the roads at rally street and rutland avenue i would like to see these remain cul-de-sacs no through roads so that miller street does not become congested with further traffic this is with either them being as they are open space or as proposed residential property additionally i would like the roundabout at miller street and bishopsgate street to remain and no traffic lights added i do not want vehicles flowing to stop on miller street roberts road or these other two streets i am just going to pause there for one second to say are elected members able to hear me well enough thank you glad to uh get that sorted out so i will continue uh with mr walter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i do not want another train station at miller street as there is already sufficient access to vic park or carl stations i also do not want any additional walk bridges over roads around that area his next statement i do not want the side road section of robert 's road modified in any way i.e seven roberts road and would like the traffic flow to remain as is whereby entering miller street one way and mandatory left turn towards the roundabout he then has a number of questions which will be directed uh appropriately so the first question is if lots six and seven one thousand and three and one thousand four and forty five one thousand become residential what does r60 mean in regards to the number of dwellings the height of the buildings the type of the buildings i.e house unit apartment multi-storey and i will direct that question to our chief community planner ms natalie martin good thank you uh through the chair thanks for the question in terms of how many dwellings there could be it depends on what type of dwellings so if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to townhouses they could have approximately up to 31 dwellings if they were apartments or that 's otherwise known as multiple dwellings it could be up to 55 dwellings and the height could be anywhere between 5 meters and 15 meters there is some more detail in the report about a combination of permutation of those different types of drawings and heights thank you ms martin good the second question that we have from mr wartley is as follows if lots six and seven one thousand and three and one thousand four and forty five one thousand and five become residential would you consider factoring in a publicly accessible small cafe in the dwelling complex if not what about one at lot 1002 bt avenue where the parks and recreation open space is proposed to remain i 'd direct that question again to our chief community through the chair a residential zoning a cafe or restaurant is actually prohibited use it 's an ex-use if it was a public open space zone it could be considered but uh as council probably aware we 're working on a new town planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the land would be important to know in terms of what the new town planning scheme might consider as as suitable on a residential owned land in that regard thank you the final question from mr wartley is does this set a precedence to enable further parks and open spaces to be turned into residential dwellings around that area and i 'll address that question again to our chief community through the chair a precedent it is only only occurs when you have very similar circumstances the circumstances of miller 's crossing is highly unusual so the likelihood of there being a similar zoning circumstance and land owned by the western planning commission wanting it to be zoned residential is highly unlikely in saying that though as the land is owned by the state government um uh it 's up to them what they propose the town is doesn 't own the land it 's state government land and it 's up to the state government i.e the west australian planning commission and the minister as to what that land is zoned ultimately through the skin amendment uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final part of mr wartley 's contribution by way of statement he says i want lot 1002 bt avenue to remain parks and recreation open space alternatively keith miller 's crossing lot 1003 now move on to some questions and statement um from the rate payers association of victoria park so uh the rate pays association there 's a combination of some uh statement and questions it begins item 15.5 2022 minor review of council policies in june 2020 policy 223 was amended to include the provision that town employees issued with the vehicle inclusive of private use conditions will pay a fortnightly contribution rate based on the state government vehicle usage rates as outlined in the senior officer vehicle scheme this rate currently commences at 150 dollars per fortnight question one how many light vehicles does the town currently have going to direct that question to our acting chief operations officer mr denham through you uh chair 43 thank you mr denham the next question is how many light vehicles are currently issued to employees for private use i 'll again direct that back to mr denham through you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you the next question is how many employment contracts have been created reviewed or renewed since june 2020 for any employee who has been issued with the vehicle for private use direct that again to you mr denham through you chair the answer is none created with private use within that time frame thank you the next question is how many employees issued with vehicles for private use are paying the rate published in the state government 's senior officers vehicle scheme of which the nominal rate shown in policy 223 in 2020 was 150 per fortnight direct that to you mr denham through your chair the answer is currently one and i would add that only fixed term contracts can be renegotiated other existing staff with vehicles are subject to the terms and conditions of their existing contracts thank you the next question from the rate payers association is as follows on the 29th of march 2022 council held the annual electors meeting in the council chambers with 17 electors present in the room why are the council abf and ocm meetings still being held online so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting in the local government act that is required to be held in person that 's why it was held in person on the 29th of march 2022 i don 't address the assertion in the question about the number of electors who are present in the room as that 's an assumption by the questioner the question about why the council abf and ocm meetings are still being held online is as a result of a determination that i made in exercise of my powers under the local government administration regulations regulation 14 d sub paragraph 2 subsection a the local government administration regulations 1996 provides that the presiding member or council may make a determination that it is appropriate that meetings of the council be held by electronic means where there is a state of emergency that is continuing in the state and that is a decision that i have made in january this year ahead of the february council meetings and i made that decision again in late february ahead of the holding of the march a gender briefing forum and march ordinary council meeting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency in western australia and i was satisfied that conditions prevailing were such that it was appropriate meetings that were able to be held online could be held online and should be held online and i made that decision again almost at the end of march where i determined that the state of emergency continued in place i also noted in the four weeks prior to the end of march that the wa borders had opened on the 5th of march as a result of which community transmission of coronavirus had escalated exponentially from a seven day average number of 205 cases daily uh prior to five march to a seven day average of over 7 500 cases daily suggesting a greater risk for elected members administrative staff and members of the public at public-facing meetings in our chamber and that there were in fact 9754 cases in the 24 hours prior to me making my decision and although the wa government had issued further restrictive public health directions at level two ahead of the five march border opening there was then a proposal to transition back to modified level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 14th of april however i was of the view that there remained uncertainty about what the month of april would bring in terms of the extent of community transmission and the ongoing risk to all persons by public gatherings indoors in limited areas such as the confines of the council chamber in relation to uh next question from the ratepayers association why was the annual electors meeting held in person direct that question to the manager of governance ms branovich the annual meeting of elections was held in person because local governments can 't electors meetings online under current legislation and it was also held in person to allow the town electives to be able to raise motions and votes on them thank you thank you uh there is now a statement from the ratepayers association which i will read out this statement says answers provided at the march ocm disclosed that the town has not done a risk assessment in relation to access to town buildings and is relying on the state government 's proof of vaccine directions number three direction number three does not preclude the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of vaccine be a determining factor or attendees and such meetings the next question is as there is no documented resolution by the council to hold meetings online who has made the decision to hold the meetings online as i have just answered uh in my previous answer the decision about holding meetings online uh has been made by myself as the presiding member as i 'm entitled to do so under the local government administration regulations final question from the ratepayers association is as no risk assessment has been done please explain on what basis the council is excluding the public from abf and ocm i will answer this question there has been no exclusion of the public from the agenda briefing forum or the ordinary council meetings the local government administration regulations provide a power to the presiding member or the council to make a decision to hold ordinary council meetings and other meetings of the council except for annual meetings of electors and special meetings of electors to be held online provided that the local government makes available a mechanism by which the public can continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town 's chief executive officer by making an appropriate mechanism available for members of the public to pre-submit their questions and statements to be read out during council meetings that has continued to be the case until tonight where we begin our newest process after some testing an investigation of the options open to us where members of the public are invited to join us live during this meeting and indeed i understand there will be members of the public who will be joining us shortly so there has been no decision by council to exclude public from abf or ocm we are not required to conduct a risk assessment on the basis that direction number three does not apply to the town of victoria park 's administration building and there is no policy that has been implemented by the town of victoria park to exclude members of the public from the administration for building on the basis of their covert 19 vaccination status or otherwise so i 'm satisfied i 've answered those questions on behalf of the ratepayers association we now have two questions and statements from ratepayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 months how many additional staff positions have been created for waste management what are their position titles and duties direct that question to our acting chief operations officer denim thank you chair through you um the answer is two multi-functional positions the first is a project manager with environmental and waste management duties and the second is a project officer again with environmental and waste education duties thank you thank you the next question is breaches of the waste local law 2022 approved by council last month have the potential to result in a person 's driver 's license being suspended who is responsible for these breaches is it the rate payer for the property or the tenant direct that question to mr denham thank you chair through you uh the answer is that uh at council last month um the waste local law 2022 was endorsed by council to go out for public consultation the town 's waste local law is based on the model approved by the joint standing committee on delegated legislation where there is indisputable evidence that someone whether the property owner the tenant or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contaminants in a bin despite having been repeatedly requested by the town to refrain from doing so that person may be fined 350 and the general rule which is applied which will be applied is three strikes with town notifications for proven intentional breaches thank you thank you we now have um one statement from mr maxwell which i will now proceed to read out and it is as follows last week while traveling on horden street i picked up a cardboard box that was in the middle of the road and placed it into a yellow top bin in front of someone 's house the bins had not yet been emptied under the waste local law passed by council last month there are penalties for placing items in the wrong bin but i placed the cardboard carton in the green bin the owner of the property could have been fined by a town officer who under the local law has the power to issue 350 infringement without warning it is unclear in the local law as to whether the owner of the property or the tenant would be fined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be responsible however the effect of the infringement would make them guilty and they would have to prove their innocence under the threat of greater penalties including fines of up to five thousand dollars and the suspension of their driver 's license there is no provision in the local law that could cause the ceo or his appointed staff to investigate or to first issue a warning any discretion that the ceo or his appointed officer may apply is determined purely on their own judgment there is no formal process in the local law to protect the rights of citizens i believe the council has erred in providing this unfettered power to the ceo and urged the council to amend this local law to include some checks and balances that concludes the statement from mr maxwell but i will highlight mr denham 's answer to the previous questions by mr maxwell made it clear council has not endorsed the waste local law 2022 they have endorsed for the draft to go out for the public comment so until such time as it has been endorsed by a council and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local laws it will not actually be the law we now also have pre-submitted from steve walker bentley two questions in one statement regarding item 12.2 and at will street question one considering the known facts of the 2021 may june july consultation process of the november council meetings why did relevant town offices not forward the draft november transport strategy to city of canning and city of belmont by emailed letter requests during november or december 2021 so they could contribute any real comment direct that question to the chief community planner ms natalie martin good through the chair uh the town did provide the draft transport strategy uh and parking management plan to both the city of canning and the city of belmont uh we just didn 't receive any uh comments from them thank you thank you ms martin good next question please explain the length of time the hired consultant wsp was engaged for drafting and finalizing the april 2022 revised town of victoria park transport strategy and the total fee paid to them again direct that to ms through the chair the consultants undertook work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year at a cost of 104 000. thank you uh next is a statement from uh mr walker which i will read out as follows the statement reads regarding atwell street east victoria park despite receiving no explanation from town of victoria park offices my understanding is both the duplicate residential compounds at 63 at wall street and 66 at wall street were built by the same owner at the same time year 1988 legacy city first shepherd award decision purely for short-term student accommodation despite being right in the middle of residential suburbia that each has 15 rooms rear laundry washroom and car parks for 12 vehicles each this is your publicized at wall street local centre as of april 2022 it seems only one shop business on the local center section is open the two residential compounds with their deliberate short-term stays that avoid residential tenancy agreements avoid six-month leases avoid one-year leases avoid non-students dominating the local centre and appear to be dictating its direction that concludes the statement pre-submitted by mr walker that also concludes all of the pre-submitted public questions and statements i now understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask question live in our meeting and we will now be about to hear from amy holdsworth who will be the first person to join one of our council meetings held electronically online so i could ask our meeting support person spray to usher mrs holdsworth into the room i can see her now indicated that she is present so miss holdsworth um we 're still in the middle of public participation time you may ask your questions and make any statements that you wish to do so but please do note that we do have meeting conduct rules around uh appropriate conduct when asking questions um questions and statements are not to personalize any comments regarding elected members or town staff so if you would like to please begin with your questions and we 'll do them one at a time so that i can direct them to the appropriate staff member for answers so welcome ms holdsworth and please proceed thank you may vernon um also i have three questions in one statement all of my questions relate to item 16 of the agenda and specifically to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers a comment um my question my first question um i will give it a small brief um summary before that to give context offers a comment too for this item states that feedback has already been sought from a sample of the business community at the business breakfast held on 8th of february 2022 two surveyed questions were asked of the attendees my question is how many attendees of the february 8 business breakfast provided answers to each of these two survey questions uh thank you miss holdsworth i 'm going to direct that question to the town 's chief community planner ms martin good through the chair uh there were 32 responses from attendees to question 1 and 33 responses to question 2. thank you miss martin good ms holdsworth your next question thank you mayor vernon uh question two relate relates to officer comment 2d again part of item 16 of the agenda officer comment 2d states that a broad survey of the community was also undertaken in 2020 to ascertain the impact of covert 19 and in response to the above a support local project is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are currently implementing or intending to implement to support local business based on the current needs of the community right now as assessed through community engagement or based on data that was collected two years ago when we did not have community transmission mandates or the same long-term restrictions thank you ms holdsworth to direct that question to ms martin good uh through the chair the current mem uh measures that we 're implementing are based on the town 's current feedback from the business community so in particular the february 2022 business breakfast feedback in addition we regularly meet with community groups and also uh we have recently done some engagement more general engagement on different projects but we often get feedback and related to business covert effects the 2020 survey is just another source of information that the town has used to inform its communications and approach uh relating to covid thanks thank you ms martin good miss holdsworth your next question please thank you mayor vernon um question three relates to officer comment six from agenda item 16. officer comment 6 refers to statistics from the abs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of impacts from covert 19 on households in australia my question is given that abs data represents australia as a whole and is not state specific and given not all states in australia have the same level of restrictions in place and therefore any impacts are possibly not comparable state to state what section of the abs data gives insight into the specific nature of impacts from covert 19 on households in victoria park thank you miss holdsworth i 'll again direct that question to ms martin good uh through the chair i 'll need to take that question on notice thank you thank you miss martin good uh miss holdsworth did you have any other questions that you wanted to ask um thank you mayor vernon i have a statement not a question yep that 's absolutely fine um we generally don 't distinguish it agenda briefing forums between questions and statements we just call it public participation time we find that 's a little easier for our community so you may proceed with a statement if you wish to make one okay um thank you i would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding the number of um businesses that participated i note that the first question was 32 the second question was 33 coincidentally i have a number that is 33 during march i spent a few hours visiting businesses in the big park area and i spoke with owners and managers of 33 businesses in these conversations i asked these business owners and managers if they would be open to answering my questions regarding the impact covert 19 and associated mandates are currently having on their business and a reflective back in the last six months so the 33 business that i actually spoke with a few more than that but 33 businesses did volunteer to answer these questions and i did a collection of their answers i would just like to provide three summary statistics on that just as a point of reference so that same figure um 33 76 of businesses that i spoke to reported a decrease in revenue in the last six months 70 of those businesses reported an increase in operating costs in the last six months and 48 of businesses reported that they currently have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a current this is within the last few weeks that snapshot of businesses which i would note represents a fairly consistent number than attended the business breakfast and that 's the information that i have received from them thank you uh thank you miss holdsworth and thank you for joining us um as i say as the first member of our community to take up the opportunity to participate um live during an electronic meeting of our council so thank you very much i will now say that we 'll conclude public participation time since i 've not been notified that there are any other members of the public who are waiting to enter the electronic meeting room and we will now proceed with the remainder of our agenda item 8 is presentations we have none item 9 is deputations we have none item 10 method of dealing with the gender business although we don 't make any decisions at agenda briefing forums i would like to say this to elected members we have received indication of questions from elected members so far in relation to only three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment number 56 to town planning scheme number one miller 's crossing carlisle item 12.2 the transport strategy and parking management plan and item 15.3 which is the review of policy 404 fireworks management results of public consultation now in accordance with our usual process for agenda briefing forums we 'll only deal with those items on the agenda that elected members have indicated they have a question to ask or multiple questions to ask for that matter tonight are there any other items on the agenda that are not included in 12.1 12.2 and 15.3 i 'm now going to go through elected members and have you add the item numbers onto our list so that we make sure we get through all questions so um i 'm going to hear from uh deputy mayor anderson first followed by councillor hendricks and then councillor hayner deputy mayor anderson thank you i 'd like to ask the question of 14.2 please uh sorry was that 14.2 yeah 14.2 thank you thank you councillor hendricks sorry and thank you man 13. i 'd like to ask a question on please thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh councillorhamer thank you vernon uh number 16 for me please number 16. thank you next i did see councillor if i think you had your hand up but it 's disappeared now um would you like to add another question another idea i was going to add sixteen point one but councillor hamer beat me to it all right thank you that 's good to hear any other items on the agenda that uh elected members would wish to ask about um it 's going to be a case of a bit of going going gone for this i would like to add one item in that i would like to ask a couple of quick questions about and that item is item 13.4 which is the proposed disposal of cafe spaces that leisure life and aqua life by way of lease which unfortunately does mean councillor creamy having declared a financial interest you will need to leave the meeting when we get to that particular question or that particular item rather but um i will note that and remind you because with us using other zoom webinar function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exiting the meeting completely and will need to log back into the meeting as there are no breakout rooms during the webinar so uh we 're proceeding now forward and we are starting with questions on item 12.1 uh which are the chief community planners reports um so if we could proceed to those first please thank you so these are questions in relation to item 12.1 which is the modified amendment number 56 to the town planning scheme number one uh residential density upcoding uh miller 's crossing carlisle um councillor hendrix you have some questions and then i 'll go to counsellor sandro thank you mayor and i 've got quite a few questions on this one so is that okay just time off one at a time uh yes i think i was given an indication that you had about four questions but um there 's no limit on elected member question numbers so um please proceed um what i will get you to do though is do your questions one at a time so that we can direct them appropriately to the officers who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be written in the command tense and require the council to do something points two and three of the recommendations should be in command tense but they are not so they don 't read correctly and by that i 'll just read point two so it would say as it is now that council the scheme amendment report documents being modified to reflect that doesn 't make any sense i 'm saying with point and the council the documents referred to the point to above and so on um so my question is what is the command for each of these points and can they be worded correctly for the ocn direct that question to chief community planner ms natalie martin good uh through the chair council hendricks is quite correct there is some words missing um in two and three such as endorses and 0.6 needs to be changed to point a we will make those uh corrections for ocm thank you thank you councillor hendricks your next question please so the next question um if flights 1004 and 1005 were combined and offered as a single lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would be more conducive um to which the aim of this you know to showcase um the classic development um who would make that decision and who would action it ms martin good uh through the chair that would be the west australian planning commission councillor hendricks please proceed there 's no is there a guarantee that they would do that or is it um or is it up to them completely and we just get what we get yes martin good through the chair while there 's no guarantee if i was a land developer either wanting to develop it as the commission or sell it uh it would make sense to actually amalgamate them into one lock because you 're able to get a higher dwelling yield but to answer the question there 's no guarantee but highly likely in my opinion okay thank you and another question um out of the submissions there was 53 out of 60 submissions which supposed the r60 residential zoning so what would be the consequences if we were not to go along with this resolution correct that question to ms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minister of planning ultimately makes a decision on the amendment uh and not supporting the officer recommendation would not likely change either the ministers or the australian planning commission 's uh position on this it 's been uh the same for some time uh not supporting the resolution would also forfeit any potential for a local development plan uh to be considered as a requirement of the land thank you okay and i 've got a couple of other questions which i didn 't um send through because i thought of these ones afterwards please proceed councilman hendrix so and again do them one at a time yep so the next one is um it 's going to ask how can a high quality medium density housing be ensured when point 14 of the report it states that a local development plan would also assist in ensuring that future development advice of the future development of the sites could be indeed a showcase for high quality media density housing as per say as stated by the intention unfortunately such intentions do not guarantee such an outcome so my question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ensured that we 're going to get a high quality um housing but there 's no guarantee of it sort of contra enter into it uh well just ask um confine ourselves councillor hendricks to the questions without um accompanying statements of sentiment uh is martin good uh through the chair in the town 's opinion the the best way of ensuring a high quality sustainable outcome is through the uh the requirement to have a local development plan so local development plan will go above and beyond what the minimum r code requirements are and it will it a local development plan is binding if you don 't have a local development plan and you purely rely on the provisions of the r codes it is left to chance depending on how good a developer and design you get with with pure vr codes and no local development plan if you get a great designer then yes you could have a good outcome but uh there the country may also be the case thank you okay and the last question i have is to do with the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our local tree planting policy states um that there will be one tree or they need to provide one tree for each dwelling so so if there 's say 30 odd dwellings um i the question is can they put 30 trees um with a high yeah with a lot of dwellings on the block on that block or or do they need to put the extra trees somewhere else um is not good uh through the chair i would doubt there would be room for 30 additional toys on trees on site however it would be a common sense approach to allow those trees to be planted in the immediate locality uh preferably with on public land and all the street verge uh thank you okay thank you that 's all my questions thanks councillor hendricks councillor sandro yes thank you mayor vernon um just following on um in relation to officers um comments earlier in the discussion i think with the community there was a question about the total number of dwellings for uh 60 being either 31 if group and 55 if an apartment there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the height for possibly 31 dwellings uh direct that question to ms martin good um and again council sandra will need to try and keep your voice close to the microphone because i lost you there at the last bit it trailed off ms martin good are you able to answer that question uh through the chair yes i did hear most of council alessandra 's question so hopefully i 'll be answering i think you asked what would the height be of the 31 dwellings um so it will vary and it also depends on whether there 's a local development plan so a local development plan can prescribe any height that is deemed to be appropriate if you don 't have a local development plan and you 're relying purely on the r codes then uh whether it 's uh single houses group dwellings or multiple germs the height can vary between 5 meters and 15 meters so 5 meters is generally a one or two story house 15 metres is generally a three to four story dwelling thank you thank you um if the wa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be something that would come back to council or would this be um just hearing from the responses something that um the wapc could instigate or that the town could delegate in terms of sowing it 80 or higher is martin good up through the chant notwithstanding that the state isn 't seeking to sign the land r80 but uh let 's assume that they would the town doesn 't have the delegated authority to uh to approve that they would need to the commission and the minister would need to instruct the town to re-advertise that because that would be a significantly different proposal to r-60 council then re-advertise that and a similar process to what 's happening now would then come back to council for then a recommendation to the commission and minister but again it is a minister that has the final saying not the town thank you thank you um subsequent question um if it is zoned at r80 then what would be the composition of the number of dwellings on that site is mountain good as well as height through the chair i would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the density r80 is an apartment zoning so there is actually no minimum uh lot size for apartments rather than a minimum lot size it is the number of dwellings is constrained by design having a regard to setbacks and height so it will be a very open-ended question in terms of apartments uh also r80 it would be highly doubtful whether you would get single houses or group dwellings otherwise known as uh townhouses with an rit zoning in rit zoning is very much geared towards apartments thank you thank you there are my questions thanks counselor sandro councillor hendrix you 've got your hand up again you have more questions yes i did have one more is the if the developers come up with a design that 's um that suits them can they go to saturn have design approved even though we don 't like it ms martin group uh through the chair uh an applicant could only go to sat in if they either got a refusal from the town or the jade app jdop i suspect would be the determining authority or they get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e we 've taken more than statutory time um so so the short answer is yes they can go to that thank you thank you thanks councillor hendricks are there any other questions about item 12.1 uh [Music] i 'm just trying to check because i 'm not seeing all counsellors on my screen at the moment so i 'm trying to ascertain if there 's anyone assume i should say to elected members you are all aware you can raise your electronic hand which probably gives me the greatest understanding of whether you 're seeking to ask a question council alessandro yes thank you mayor ben and just a subsequent question in relation to road reserve and where there is a road reserve through those lots and whether that could be indicate indicate whether where that road reserve is thank you i 'm sorry counselor sandra i didn 't hear your question and i 'm pretty sure it won 't come out on the recording well enough you said that it was in relation to a road reserve that was through those lots um yes what were you wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve is located within those lots okay thank you thank you good uh through the chair hopefully there 'll be an attachment that actually shows the current zoning because those three lots are a combination of road reserve residential uh 30 and unzoned land so uh just because i don 't have it in front of me off the top of my head the most northern lot uh about 50 of the lot it 's almost cut in half in terms of what is zoned road reserve and then it tapers down to slightly less than half to the more southern lots but there should be an attachment um in there very happy to uh in the further comments section ocm maybe point that out a little bit more clearly for you thank you thank you thank you ms martin good um so there being no indication of any other questions in relation to this item we 'll now move on to item 12.2 on our agenda which is the transport strategy and parking management plan councillor deveraux understand you have some questions that you would like to ask yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to say that to start with i really appreciate the minor refinements to the work on the transport strategy that have responded to some of the feedback that was received i have three particular queries about the new draft the first one relates to what i note in point three of the officers report which talks about aligning with the document 's vision and improving clarity for the community in the changes that are made the vision states to provide an integrated accessible and sustainable transport network which connects people to places and supports the town as a livable inner city community i wanted to ask given that could the strategy title be modified to say integrated transport strategy so that it could better convey the intent of this vision to connect people and places direct that question to ms martin good please through the chair uh administration have no issues with with that change the neatest and simplest way to do that is when council considers this item at april to just have a simple uh amendment uh regarding the renaming in that respect thank you thanks very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 suggested adapting images to better represent the town 's current and desired vibrancy and pedestrian orientation i wondered if the integrated element was to be included could the front page framing image capture this integrated vision in a different way like the corporate business plan which shows a vibrant street with pedestrians family cyclists trees shops and cars it 's not good uh through the chair that 's a relatively simple change to make we could even do that after it 's adopted because it doesn 't it simply would be considered a formatting change thank you councilman deborah thanks very much the third question was that i really appreciated seeing the strategy on a play page that 's been put together which really captures in simple terms the intent of the strategy in keeping with the above questions i wondered if part of that strategy on a page could include a representation through an image of um the same sort of vibrant livable people-centered streets as part of that one-page strategy is mark good out through the chair yes happy to make that change thanks councillor deborah thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 30 and i look at wonder given the stated aim of this is to measure the success of this strategy in meeting the town 's vision and objectives i wonder if it would be possible in addition to the mode shift target to consider other modest and simple indicators that could be included for example related to the provision of infrastructure or other inter innovations of the sub programs like the end of trip facilities in town assets the infrastructure for cycles and e-writable devices or street cape improvements and skinny streets i wonder whether that could allow tangible short-term recognition of progress and success broader than just the mode shift thank you is mark good through the chair the short answer is yes in any event we 'll need to report on the performance of the transport strategy program which includes reporting on all the sub programs and all of the projects this is quite similar to how we report for urban forest program and economic development programs and that reporting will provide uh outline of success and the progress of the programme of work thank you thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions on this item no in that case we will move on then the next item that was indicated on the list was item 13.2 so 13.2 is investigation of a verge bomb system um so questions about this item please councillor hendrix thank you mayor vernon um my question was to do with the recommendation is not to go ahead with it because of various reasons um so i was wondering if they had investigated the possibility of maybe putting a um a camera on the on the um either the demolition demolition side of building side or both just for the duration of the project um and that way they can identify who 's actually making the damage and and recoup the money that way it 's just wondering if that was something that the towns considered direct that question to the acting chief operations officer mr denham through your chair yes uh that the possibility of putting in cameras and cctv has been investigated if i could perhaps refer that question to mr john wong manager of technical services who can comment further on that thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new button yeah through the chair um we we 're still investigating the uh the use of cctv um or similar type of camera systems to monitor the construction activities um affecting the uh the veg area so it is something that we are keen to to to adopt um um and we might even consider a trial um for a uh a high-risk construction uh project project thank you councillor hendricks anything further that have said thank you uh thank you um i would like to ask a question um that uh follows on from that answer from mr wong given that elected members have recently been informed about the significant expense involved in using cameras to monitor noise from premises how expensive would it be to be installing cameras for extended periods of time during some building constructions that can last for months if not longer for the town and what is it likely to take in order to store all of that electronic data just so that you can look at it all later and determine whether or not there is damage that can be the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madam chair um we are definitely aware that um the hiring or even buying of such cameras will be expensive and also to have somebody to monitor or to extract the relevant footage um from the recording uh will be quite time consuming and obviously could be costly as well to have staff member or even a contractor doing that so that 's something that we are still investigating unfortunately we don 't have um an indicative uh cost for such camera users at this stage so if it 's okay we will take the question on notice and perhaps provide further information as part of the further consideration section of the report thank you uh thanks mr wong we 'll take that on notice are there any other questions about item 13.2 councillor heyman um thank you bennett is it possible to go back to 12.2 after this question um yes we can um do try and do these matters in order if we can counsel homer um i did i did have my hand up you just missed it at the end sorry i yes i 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me moving on it means i have not seen your hand up so please speak up um obviously the electronic hand can only be seen by me at the moment something is guiding my screen and i can only see a handful of elected members not all of them so that might be something to do with the organization of this software so we will go back to item 12.2 but please i encourage councillors don 't wait around if you hear me go past the item that you want to deal with i think lawana might have a quick question i can see that councilor homer thank you um i was about to go to councillor los angeles if your question relates to this item yes thank you melvin and just um a question first 13.2 um coming out from obviously the comments about trials um given the recommendation um as it is if that were to occur would that have to be an amendment would that have to be an additional point within the recommendation in terms of allowing for a trial to occur if that is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you um i might go to mr denham first given that that 's a like a higher order question about this item yeah thank you chair um it it could be dealt with by means of an additional um recommendation or perhaps which perhaps could be framed if council is so minded just as a recommendation to look into the the scope to use cameras or ct cctv thank you thank you thanks council sandro um mr denham if i could just flesh that out with you for a moment so you 're saying that if council wished to direct the town to conduct such a trial they would do that through an amendment to the officer recommendation but otherwise would it be open to the town to conduct such a trial in the course of their ordinary business subject to there being sufficient budget available for that whenever the next budget cycle commences and that would occur just as a part of the town 's ordinary business completely aside from this particular item on the agenda thank you chair um the second part of your of your question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this in the ordinary course of business subject to budget thank you uh any questions arising council or sandro yes thank you just arising from the office 's comments if it is um not an amendment to this item um how would feedback be conveyed back to elected members if the town did have sufficient funds and were able to undertake a trial thank you mr denham thank you madam chair um we would use the en portal to provide this feedback to elected members thank you thanks mr denham anything further counselor sandro yes thank you mayor brennan um given that response um if it were not part of the amendment and was done through the budget and through the town administration would that trial be available to the community in terms of its results if it 's not through an amendment thank you sorry council sandra there was a couple of words there that cut out you asked would that would it be the results of the trial you are wanting to know would be available to elect members know if the results of the trial if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how would the community be able to access those results if they were wanting to know the results of that trial if it was not part of an amendment on the item thank you thank you i 'm assuming the answer to that question would be those members of the community who are interested may be able to make such an inquiry at a subsequent council meeting or they could write into the town or the town might choose to publish details such trial to the community mr denham would that be right or there are there other mechanisms that results of such a trial might be shared with the community or available to them thank you madam chair it could be done in a way that you you have explained that also the recommendation already provides for a sort of a formal mechanism to detail and report back on damage to infrastructure and we could probably sort of accommodate that through that part of the recommendation thank you council alessandro that 's all thank you thank you um can ask the minute secretary please to move us back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologies uh my question was just about the profiles that they have in the uh transport strategy is there any um way to mention i 've seen in other documents there was like a percentage uh mentioned of a high 70 to 80 percent of people who live in the town who actually work outside of the town and vice versa people who work in the town are actually traveling from outside of the town the profiles mentioned didn 't sort of pick up on on those um figures is there anything to add there ms man good uh through the chair are you talking about the eight user profiles that are in the transport strategy yes uh those are hypothetical people used to test what 's uh the actions in the transport strategy so i understand what you 're saying in terms of there are statistics that are that relate to people that either live in the town or work in the town but those user profiles are there to test the the strategies robustness one might say so they 're a little bit different thank you okay so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the chair they are it would be very strange if we chose a user profile that is completely foreign to the town but i don 't think that they 're meant to be statistically uh perfectly representing every single facet of the town that would be really difficult there would probably be a hundred profiles we did pick eight that we thought were generally commensurate with people that could be in the town but it is not meant to be a hundred percent um representative that makes sense thanks thank you one more further question um page 30 has the the targets which mentioned the the pie graph with the 12 bus and the uh 2031 targets are those percentage increases uh vicious or are they what the town was hoping for that i mean i was trying to be confused with the colors trying to reference which was which to be honest is martin good through the chair the colors are the same it 's the change in the percentages that are aspirational so for instance um i don 't have it in front of me but from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car usage look at the percentage the color is the same but the percentages is decreasing for the number of the percentage of people that are using cars to get around the town so the way to read that is that the colors are the same look at the change in percentage as aspirational targets thank you okay just in my screen the bus and the bicycle look to be the same color so it 's just ambiguous there for me ms martin good anything arising out of that comment from councillor homer uh through the chair very happy to provide some further explanation of that in the further comment section the report if that 's helpful to council hamer yeah thank you thank you ms mark good uh thanks councilor homer um if we can now go forward please to item 13.4 13.4 is the proposed disposal of the cafe spaces at leisure life and aqualife by way of lease so i had essentially only one question that depending on the answer to that question i might have another my question is predominantly in relation to the cafe space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrender of the previous leases for those spaces were completed that a casual arrangement had been entered into by oh sorry um this is item 13.4 is councillor karimi gone yes she has left the meeting great thank you um so confirm at 7 53 council creamy 's gone from room already um so going back to my question um with that casual arrangement with the basketball association if we were to approve re-advertising of these spaces and we again did not receive any expressions of interest that were compliant um what is the office 's position about at that stage seeking to um separately move towards a more formalized position for the perth basketball association for the cafe at leisure life assuming they were to want that to continue um is that an option mr denham yeah thank you chair the feedback we 've had from the uh sort of facility managers is that the basketball association 's arrangement is working reasonably well um it is a fairly limited service which is limited to certain times um but yes it it could be looked at to to retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their existing higher arrangement or in or in terms of some other enhanced arrangements uh whatever uh they would be willing and able to uh to deal with um i would point out that uh if we were to move uh to uh say a lease with that association uh the retail shop legislation does not uh does not allow a landlord to impose a requirement on a retail shop tenant uh to uh to be open for certain hours it 's fair go legislation and uh if if it were intended to uh have a binding commitment from the basketball association to to be open um uh sort of for longer hours it may not be it may not be possible to achieve that because of the limitations of that legislation thank you um so in the offices report on this item referring to i guess the community purposes aspect that it said in the report i guess is the intention for trying to achieve by way of disposing of these spaces noting that there 's reference to social enterprises is there is that a limitation um for seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitation after potentially another round of advertising is there a mechanism for council to consider changing that limitation in order to i guess broaden the scope of parties that might be able to apply to utilize the spaces under a lease or a license or some other arrangement mr denham yes thank you chair um if i have understood the question correctly i think we have already moved uh towards that sort of position with recommendation two uh which which uh no longer requires uh that a social enterprise um be uh be a criteria uh for the new lease and merely that the criteria be that we seek a service provider community or sporting organization that would complement the services provided by the town at the at these centres thank you um thank you so my final question then is so is it the administration 's view that we could not make that change now with the submitters who 've already made proposals do we have to re-advertise with that new criteria i guess that 's what i 'm trying to get at through your chair um we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advertise uh with the new criteria um we 'd potentially be looking at a much wider market if we did if we did that with the new criteria thank you i don 't have any further questions on this item is there any other elected member who 's got a question about this item i 'm not seeing any hands going up so i 'm assuming that there are no more questions about this particular item so on that basis we will move on to the next item that was indicated which is 14.2 um and that is schedule of accounts for february 2022 deputy mayor anderson you have questions yes i do thank you mayor um it 's just in relation to a line item from the 10th of february and it 's for the australian institute of management for 16 274.50 could i have some more clarification around what training that is please thank you deputy mayor anderson um to our acting chief financial officer mr ellis is that a question that you 're able to assist us with please uh thank you mayor vernon through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll take that on notice deputy mayor anderson anything further nothing further thank you thank you um are there any other questions about 14.2 i 'm not seeing any hands up so on that basis we will move on from 14.2 our next item is 15.3 which is review of policy 404 fireworks management results public consultation counselor lisandro you have some questions yes thank you matt vernon um i have a number of questions i 'll ask them one at a time my first question is um can the words and surrounding environment include including birds and wildlife and brackets be added back into the policy at the icm council sandro are you seeking a ques an answer to your question sorry um sorry and could environmental considerations being included in the policy but if it was targeted specifically for larger scale and reoccurring fire work events um sorry councilor sandra i was seeking clarification from you are you seeking an answer to your question from the town 's governance staff about this as a governance matter on a recommendation are you seeking a response from the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town 's other staff members so that i know who to direct your question to um probably both i 'd say all right i 'll direct the question first to the manager of governance and strategy ms branovich thank you to the chair that it 's not recommended by officers or the policy committee however it is open to council to make such a change thank you so counselor sandro that would require an elected member to move an amendment um to the review of the policy and the recommendation from the committee when the matter comes back to council next week at the ordinary council meeting uh in terms of directing this now to a member of the staff in terms of the environmental aspects of it um probably going to need to go to our acting chief operations officer mr denim can you inform me mr denham who might be suitable to answer this question if it 's not yourself you madam chair um could we take that uh question on notice please yes thank you take it on notice council sandro yes thank you um subsequent question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildlife considerations to be assessed which would not incur demands and constraints on time and processes for town administration mr denham um madam chair could we take uh that one on notice as well uh the previous question um the chief community plan has actually indicated that she can answer the previous question uh at this meeting now if that 's desired uh thanks uh mr denham so we 'll take that question on notice and we 'll go to the chief community planner ms martin good for the previous question and also miss martin but if you can indicate at the same time do you wish to take all further questions about this item through the chair yes i 'm happy to take all questions on this item so in terms of the previous question uh which was about um [Music] the wording of the policy um i would reaffirm what uh the manager of strategy uh said in that yes uh it is open to council to make uh those changes to the policy however it 's not recommended by officers in terms of the question as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy and what that would what implications that would have with the staff uh quite a considerable implication for staff in terms of what specifically that would be staff would need time to consider uh to give a detailed response to councils on that matter thank you um thank you ms martin good i will need to on behalf of council alessandro ask you to be able to clarify that further are you saying that you would be in a position to provide that information ahead of the ordinary council meeting next week by way of comments in the further consideration section of the report or are you saying that it would take longer than that period of time for you to be able to report back to elected members as to what would be involved through the chair we would certainly be able to give some preliminary advice i 'm not sure we 'd be able to give some detailed advice thank you all right thank you and do i take it when you refer to preliminary advice that advice would go in the further consideration section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair that 's correct thank you thank you council sandro including whether there 's anything arising out of those answers yes there is thank you matt vernon just in terms of that response from the officer um was that specifically um for um i guess my question was in relation to targeted specifically to larger scale and reoccurring fireworks events so not ones that are shorter length and but ones that are reoccurring and larger so that the policy is more nuanced so i guess that 's my question uh well i i understood you counselors to be asking about what kind of resources would be needed from the town to do that kind of assessment yes so but also whether it could be implemented within the policy on a governance level all right uh ms martin good uh through the chair in terms of the first question in terms of focusing any uh additional work by town staff to be on larger events we can certainly try and differentiate what work would be required for the larger events as opposed to the smaller events in terms of uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff i think was the second part of the question uh yes we 'll give some preliminary regards to that so was that did i cover off the questions and and reoccurring fireworks events yes yes we will uh include some preliminary consideration of that in the further comments section of the report thanks thank you all right thanks ms martin good in that case sorry counselor sandra before you go any further um for our minute secretary you can remove the taking on notice of this type of question that count mr denham indicated he need to take on notice it appears that ms martin good has answered that question now council alessandro counselor sandro judge please proceed yes thank you um a fourth question is has the town sought advice um from other councils within wa or interstate in relation to environmental and animal and foreign impacts for example city of coburn you mean fauna impacts of fireworks yes the interacts of fireworks thank you ms martin good uh through the chair no we haven 't uh because we 've sought advice from dbca department of biodiversity conservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thank you ms mark good councillor sandra um [Music] subsequent to that and this probably will need to be taken on notice if they haven 't provided it in advance given that response are there councils within wa or interstate that do have or take into consideration environmental and animal and fauna impacts in relation to fireworks just their policies not their in depth if there are councils out there um that just so you know council of sandro there is still an issue with regards to hearing all of the words of your questions ms martin good did you get all of that sufficient to be able to answer it uh through the chair yes i did hear that but my answer is that i 'm sorry i 'll have to take that question on notice thank you all right thank you we 'll take that on notice councillor sandra anything further no that 's all thank you thank you is there anyone else who has any questions in relation to this item counselor deborah thanks mayor vernon i just wanted to ask um and i 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i wanted to ask about the city of coburn 2021 review and impact assessment of their fireworks because it suggests trial alternatives could include drone shows and light shows because it says they are appreciated fireworks are appreciated by many but the overall perception of fireworks is changing and more people are becoming concerned about the impact on animals and the appropriateness of the displays my question is if our officers aware of this review and suggestion for alternatives to be considered and could this be encouraged as part of the policy changes we 're making to the fireworks policy thank you is martin good uh through the chair uh no i wasn 't uh aware of this and happy to do some further research on that particular matter included in the further comments section of the report thank you so on that basis we 'll take that on notice councillor deborah so that it goes back next uh agenda is there anything further no many things thank you are there any other elected members who have questions about this item note um it looks like there are no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last item that was listed item 16.1 thank you councillor heyman do you wish to go first since it is about your notice of motion yes i will thank you man vernon um a couple questions um why would a survey take four weeks to complete could this be done via an email to a number of local businesses well i will direct these questions councillor homer but if the question is why will it take four weeks then we should start with that question first um before going into how the survey is conducted because the answer your first part of your question why will it take four weeks may very well answer any subsequent operational technical aspects that you might want to know about so um ms martin good through the chair a four week time frame for a survey would encompass compiling appropriate questions testing the it whether it 's with the survey monkey or some other software program you would want a survey to be out for a minimum of two weeks for the public which would include time for the communications to be promoted regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyze those results that would what would be the what the four weeks would comprise of thank you councillor homer thank you um does the town have access to greece 44 percent um sorry counselor homer um there was a bit of electronic interference in your speaking then that i could hear i 'm not sure if others heard that um you said does the town have access to something google mobility data google mobility data is not good through the chair i don 't know what google mobility data is so i 'm not sure i 'll need to take those on notice thank you um i think there is potential for me to say that and ms martin good might recall this that when we had the covert 19 response working group we used to receive data monthly about what was going on in the town and if memory serves me correct we did from time to time get some information given to us that came from google mobility about where people 's people were traveling based on like google collects mobile phone data and stuff like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how often i don 't really know so that will be taken on notice further questions uh yes um does the town have any estimate from its regular community inputs to concerns around the duration of transmission length of restrictions masks difficulty finding employees operating costs and revenue reductions uh council hammer could i ask you to give me some indication of whether your question should be qualified with in relation to the transmission of covert 19 or is it in relation to both the transmission of covert 19 and public health directions associated with covert 19 that impact on businesses or is it only the latter and not the former in other words covet 19 as a medical condition the impacts that it might have versus covert 19 as public health directions and things that impact upon the operation of businesses just so that the staff know what it is that you 're asking them to answer sure i i didn 't really think there was a difference but if we 're experiencing um you know at least a few thousand cases per day i mean what what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are we expecting that to last three months or six months or what 's the kind of concerns around around that duration which would obviously then lead on to health restrictions well i 'm just trying to be really clear here for the benefit of the staff councillor homer because you did ask from the various means that we have available to us what information we might have to hand about a variety of things but if you 're asking about simple things like how people are coping with having covert as in experiencing it as a member of the public who gets the virus versus businesses in the town who are are reporting information that the town is collecting in some manner about the impact of there being lots of people who are not coming into their businesses versus people who are unable to come into their businesses because of a variety of covered public health restrictions and or compulsory mandates or the like it would be important to know which aspect of it or you want all those aspects covered in your answers by the town staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence that comes with well the lack of confidence that comes with community transmission and how that affects community groups or businesses or not for profits to operate all right ms martin good from the town zone resources do we have any information about the number of topics that council lahoma indicated uh through the chair i would need to take that question on notice thank you we 'll take that on notice councillor homer and yep that 'll do for me for that thanks move in okay thank you counsellor eye thank you vernon i just have a brief question um i suppose it 's to councillor homer as the as the person who drafted this um motion um i noticed the motion says that council survey community input um is councillor hamer proposing that it actually be carried out by us as councillors or actually that council requests the ceo to do counselor homer uh my impression was that the town would would run the survey as i experienced some advice that i was not able to run my own survey all right um so council if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if councillor homer would like to consider rewording his motion before next week in that case that is all thanks um i 'm sure councillor i um that 's a question that you can take offline and deal with councillor homer in due course leading up to the next council meeting um council alessandro yes thank you melvin um i have a question just in relation to um obviously the intent is to seek feedback from the residents and businesses in relation to covert and what 's happening and how they 're being impacted and to see best practices but i 'm wondering whether there 's any consideration for providing some type of a working group as we did with the covert recovery working group um in the advent that there may be increasing numbers of increasing transmission and also increasing impacts so i 'm just wanting to know if that would be a consideration and with a counsellor homer would even consider amending possibly this motion to look at providing that working group to be reinstated to include um so councillor sandro is your question very illustration yes well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's both it 's whether that whether that could occur whether that working recovery group could be reinstated and also i guess for council homer as well i guess what his thoughts would be thank you all right um well i 'll direct um the first part of your question to miss natalie martin good with regards to the town reinstating the covert recovery response working group through the chair there was a council report some months ago when i say some months ago from memory it was last year sometime the council resolved uh to note that the majority of the covent recovery strategy and the covert action plan the majority of that work had been completed which was the terms of reference of the covered working group so in terms of restarting the group it would be unclear to me what purpose that would be for if the recovery strategy and the action plan has either been completed or the majority of the actions in that plan are ongoing so while it is open for council to do that they would need to be very clear about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you thank you uh thanks councillor sandro deputy mayor anderson thank you mayor berlin um i have a question for the staff just in relation to the financial implications um i note that the report says there 's sufficient funds exist in the annual budget um and that 110 000 has been recommended in the 22-23 budget um economic and the business perception survey how much of these funds would need to be allocated to running a survey of this type please uh so councillor anderson the 110 000 that 's referred to um is both the economic development strategy and other matters as well as the business perception survey are you only interested in the amount of money for the business perception survey are you interested in financial information about the cost of the survey proposed in councillor heimer 's motion i 'm actually looking at what funds would need to be utilized for councillor hayner 's survey and just thinking that there was 110 that had been allocated in the report and i 'm wondering whether well i guess it 's twofold one how much would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two would that would those funds be coming out of the proposed 110 000 in the 2223 budget please thank you for the clarification ms martin good uh through the chair i need to take that question on notice thank you uh thank you deputy matt anderson anything further uh no nothing further thank you um thank you um i 've just got uh one of two possible questions about this item with regards to the references by the staff in the report to this is point 2 h where it says this is why the staff don 't recommend this it says if a formal survey was to be sent out to the business community take a minimum four weeks from survey creation to gathering results um as i read the elected member motion it 's to survey community input and feedback on how the community is coping so that we could appropriately support a large number of sections within our community so my question for ms martin good is the officers have only identified in their report a survey of the business community is it the officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position that councillor hamer 's motion only goes to a survey of the business community as stated in paragraph two i think effort was or is um the understanding that this type of community input would need to be surveyed from more than just the business community in order to answer the questions that have been posed by council lahaina in his motion is smart good uh through the chair if uh council was to resolve that we did a survey it would need to be wider than the community the purpose of our paragraph 2h was simply focusing on one aspect of councillor hamer 's notice of motion there are other paragraphs such as paragraphs four and nine of the report that talk about how we uh currently gain information from the community whether it 's not-for-profit groups or whether it 's through different consultation of the town but uh just to summarise it would have to be a survey of more than the business community because of the wording that 's used in council haymon 's notice of motion that talks about community groups residents ratepayers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then is how long does the town staff estimate a survey of that breadth would take and do you have any indication of what the cost of such an exercise would be for us to reach all of those broad sections within our community through the chair i need to take that question all right thank you um we 'll take those questions on notice um are there any further questions about this item from any other elected members other than councillor homer before i give him an opportunity to be the last one to ask questions about his own motion all right it looks like nobody else is uh raising their hand by the looks of it so counselor hamer was there anything that you wanted to ask arising possibly out of questions that your fellow elected members have just asked the administration and the answers they 've given yes i will respond to two of those questions offline for council for luana and council life the other question if the budget estimated costing was too high would it be possible for council to move emotion or emotion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it at a lot lower cost i feel than administration so counselor hammer you 're wanting to know that from either a governance perspective or a town subject matter officer perspective because if you 're just asking whether it 's possible for the council to resolve in theory for you to run such a survey then i suppose anything 's possible in a utopian world um but uh look i 'll i 'll direct your question first to the chief community planner and then to the manager of governance because i consider your questions got both governance and substantive issues to it ms martin good through the chair i 'm not sure i have any subject matter expert comment to make on that particular question but i suspect that the manager of governance will do so i would defer to her thank you all right i was perhaps meaning ms martin good as to whether or not um your administrative staff would have a view about what utilization would be made of by the town say place leader of economic development of a survey conducted and analyzed by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the town 's preference all right thank you um ms bryanovich as manager of governance you 're views about that thank you to the chair uh i do not believe that council should resolve for councillor hema to run this survey as there are various governance implications in relation to this thank you all right thank you um ms branovich anything further councillor homer well that 's it thank you vernon uh thank you so uh there being no indication of other questions in relation to any other items that are on the agenda um we 're now at item 17 of our agenda which is questions from members without notice on general matters are there any questions from elected members on without notice on general matters counselor lisandro yes thank you melvin and um i just have a question in relation to um children crossing signs and whether the town advocates for those to be either installed or um [Music] fixed or whether that is outside of the jurisdiction of the town and some other body oversees that thank you direct that question to the acting chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that the question uh sort of the the audio dropped out a little bit in the middle of the question i didn 't quite catch it uh counselor sandro are you able to say it again please yes thank you um my question relates to children crossing signs the orange ones um that display or um i guess high traffic areas and whether they are the responsibility of the town or another body if they were to either be in need of replacement or repair mr denham thank you chair um those would be the responsibility of main roads western australia thank you um thanks council sandro any other elected members who have got general matter questions without notice no looks like there are no further questions for general matters without notice so on that basis we move to item 18 on our agenda which is confidential matters we have none and so at 8 30 pm uh i declare this agenda briefing forum closed thank you to those who joined us on live streaming tonight thank you elected members thank you town staff we will see everyone next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnaround time between our agenda briefing forum and ordinary council meeting because we 're bringing it forward to next week instead of the usual two-week window due to the easter holiday so that 's

tonight 's being recorded um uh it 's it 's byo drinks tonight being a uh at home night so if you need to run and grab a cup of tea or a glass of wine then i suggest you do that uh now before julian launches launches right into it um one thing we ask is that if we can keep everyone can keep themselves on on mute it seems that um i have successfully set up the meeting that everyone joins and is automatically on on mute so that 's that 's surprising that i 've nailed that but that 's good and we 'll keep if you can just stay that way um that would be really good the camera is optional up to you if you want to have your camera on on or off that 's totally fine um julian is a university lecturer so i 'm sure last couple of years he 's had a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening um so i 'm sure he 's not even pretending most of the time okay yeah the last thing as well is that we will have a good good amount of time for uh questions and and answers that you at the end so if you have any questions that you would like to ask uh ask julian then put the into the chat function okay so if you um select chat and then just type it in there and i 'll scan through and and read them out to to um to julian so we can all participate in in that and yeah he said he 's open to uh spicy questions so don 't don 't um don 't hold back uh what else so the last thing as well is if you are struggling to see the slides a bit if you click on the three little dots if you 're not used to teams there 's three little dots there and the word more at the top if you click on that and then you go down there 's a couple of options gallery on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that bottom full screen you can click that if you like and then you should get a full screen presentation of the slides otherwise it sort of comes through in a bit of a bit of a slightly smaller box but you can see other people around it so anyway we can 't control that that 's that 's controlled at your end um so you 've got that that option there okay so uh what are we doing tonight and why are we doing this really why we 're doing this is because the town of victoria park has been on a a bit of a um a greening journey of the last few years you could say uh and that has involved both physical greening planting lots of trees and those sorts of things but also in terms of a lot of the environmental and sustainability strategies that have been adopted and they 're moving towards implementing them so some of those strategies that you might have heard of if you want to check out have a look at to see uh where they sit uh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest strategy and the public open space strategy they 're all adopted strategies that we 're now moving into actually implementing uh also on the way soon to be hopefully adopted is a transport strategy uh and a new town planning scheme so it 's really at this stage of a lot of work work 's been gone into these strategies and now we 're starting to implement it and we want to bring the community along on that journey with us so uh julian 's talk tonight really brings all of those things together um and looks at the the role that city design plays in improving uh our sustainability and our relationship with our environment and also the role that city the city design but also you know where you live as well and and as well as how you live so hopefully it brings it all together tonight and places us uh within the broader perth context and looking at a lot of the challenges uh that perth is the perth is facing um so with that i 'll i 'll stop there and i 'll um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so uh dr julian bolita is the co-director of the australian urban design research center which a lot of people call audric which is the um the acronym so if you hear that tonight that 's what that stands for so uh that 's at the university of western australia and he 's programmed director of ordrix master of urban design course his role at audrick also includes conducting research projects for the australian research council and the west australian state government julian is an experienced urban designer and has practiced in australia the usa uk and the middle east he 's completed a phd and has commercially published six books uh one of which i think is shamelessly plugging tonight and um has received funding from the australian research council healthways and the west australian government um what 's sort of missing from that buyer is that julian has spoken it who knows how many uh conferences um around australia and probably overseas as well uh and he 's he 's a frequent addition to lots of industry conferences as a is thought of as an industry industry leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes with what we were what were our original idea of was a community conference so rather than a conference of of uh experts or listening listening in um we wanted to sort of open it up to the community and then have like i said a community conference so um with all that uh done i 'll um i 'll pass over to julian to share his screen and and jump into his presentation thanks julian okay thanks pierre for that um gracious introduction and um and the opportunity to speak to you all tonight thanks for all being here i 'm sure you 've had a long day or some of you have had a long day on screens already so i appreciate you signing up for more you should see there a slide if everything 's working correctly excellent okay so bear with me just one moment okay okay so this presentation i 'll give today i think we 'll we 'll talk to a whole bunch of broader issues which victoria park is probably a microcosm of and the presentation really argues that for too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has tended to mask some you know issues around climate change mitigation which is how do we you know not compound climate change and also adaptation which are often not being comprehensively addressed in planning at the broader scale obviously it varies the government to local government but specifically our australian cities are bedeviled by issues of biodiversity loss extreme heat events an urban heat island effect which is where urban areas get hot and stay hot which has huge consequences for human health um so-called bushfires and soaring greenhouse gas emissions so there 's a whole bunch of issues there which are you know really wicked problems but nonetheless you know our society is one of city dwellers and a great number of the benefits of the australian way of life are provided to us by cities but they remain at the point at which our effect on atmospheric geologic hydrologic biospheric systems is most pronounced and so it 's where the problems are and where the solutions need to be found so this presentation ventures a critical appraisal i guess of where perth generally is at uh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three parts so zooming out of it in part one we will look at it 's called fraying edges and we 'll look how the australian suburban dream on the urban fringe is being stretched to breaking point we 're doing a huge amount of suburban sprawl at the moment irrigated in many cases by building booms precipitated by the pandemic so there 's real issues there uh the problems of urban sprawl at that broader scale have been well known for for a long time and a favorite topic of of academics but you know the the dominant response to that is that we must build compact cities and we must do infill uh in part two of the talk however i 'll talk about the fact that infill development in the way it 's being delivered in many cases in perth is actually compounding issues and not leading to climate resilience and and to the kind of the goals that compact city policies say we should be achieving so after two relentlessly negative sections first about sprawl second about infill we 'll then look at a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is green space orientated development it 's a way of kind of trying to find a joyous marriage between leafy suburbia and well-designed compact density in in a way that 's climate sensitive so um i 'll probably go for about 35 minutes and then i look forward to your questions and critiques okay at the dawn of the 20th century the american planning proponent frederick howe wrote the great cities of australia spread out into the suburbs in a splendid way for miles about abroad roads with small houses gardens and an opportunity for touch with the freer sweeter life which their country offers and suburbia has offered us many advantages we 've been able to produce food cope with household waste on site we can express ourselves through our gardens we can moderate the local climate through planting we can pursue hobbies we can have pets and we can live outdoors in nature and relative privacy despite these undoubted virtues the suburban model is starting to run out of steam across australia 's city and it 's enviable livability is in some respects on the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates to the eurasia biodiversity globally we 're living through what is popularly known as the sixth grade extinction a third of all amphibian species are at risk of extinction a fifth of the globe 's mammals are classified as endangered threatened or vulnerable and suburban sprawl tends to um lead to a lot of these issues now perth is in the southwest australia biodiversity hotspot they are the life support systems of the planet in terms of biodiversity uh we 've already cleared 97 93 of the biodiversity hotspot and we can see a lot of that was for agricultural development but also for urbanization here we can see the endemic plant associations of the swan coastal plain around the time sterling and fraser journeyed up the swan river and then we can see in 2017 that was looking something like that um so obviously of suburban development uh in conjunction with agricultural development has seen the relative erasure of those the biodiversity of of this one coastal plain around perth now a lot of this is because of outer suburban development here we can see the little black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the um outer suburban development little lots that have been created since 2004 and we can see them eating into this biodiversity hotspot we can see the environmentally sensitive areas and light green and the remnant vegetation in green so there 's a whole bunch of issues which go with how do you deliver this kind of development without trashing biodiversity and there 's the global significance thing here really a significant biodiverse area at a global scale and one of the big stories i think of urban design and planning in this century will be how we reconcile urban development with these these systems these natural systems between 2001 and 2010 we will delete will destroying about 841 hectares of remnant bushland per year um and that 's that 's a couple of times the size of kings park so you know the biodiversity hotspot is now in a parallelism condition we have more species of threatened plants 2 500 than other australian states and indeed most countries in the world okay the loss of biodiversity through land clearing has been compounded by climate change as brendan gleason explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be turning on us terra australis is becoming terror australia 's a blast furnace of drought heat and capricious tempests and one of the clearest evidence pieces of evidence that something big is a miss is that nature 's timetable has been badly messed up by climate change and it has been described to be running like a bad public transport system seasonal insects are arriving earlier and later flowers have reset their clocks and are blooming in unpredictable times and so for creatures which are dependent on each other which eat each other or fertilize each other such changes can spell disaster and here we can see mapping from climate change australia um which shows under an rcp 8.5 projection which is the highest projection for climate change by about 2090 uh you know areas near perth could be you know getting up around four or five degrees hotter in terms of the average max daily temperature um you know and obviously we this isn 't the future projection we 're now in amongst this sort of increase so there 's mounting worries about the thermal conditions in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of natural hazard um so it results in a greater proportion of deaths 55 than all other natural threats um and this is obviously concerning because it 's extreme heat events becoming more common and more extreme so for example the decade 2011 to 2020 was australia 's hottest on record and cities make this worse because there 's a lot of hard materials there 's a lot of dark materials and they essentially absorb a lot of heat during the day and radiate it at night producing what we call urban heat island effect at the same time the um stream flow into dams is decreasing and has been decreasing uh since the 1970s pretty markedly um you know there 's been i think it was um tim flannery said perth will be the 21st century first ghost metropolis due to a lack of water well we built a detail plan proved him wrong but the issue remains and we can see this when we look at local government areas which have no groundwater available or have exceeded their allocation here marked into orange this is from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how you know how this new suburban development on the fringe how they irrigate public open space you know is it desalinated sea water is it groundwater we know the issues with that because extracting groundwater can reduce water levels in wetlands and it 's not necessarily a renewable resource so there 's issues here about how we find the water to irrigate these suburbs to give them their suburban livability and here 's data from the um curtin uni sustainability policy institute suggesting that in a green in a green field setting on the edge of the city households are typically using more water uh than in an infill setting 70 kiloliters in comparison to 42 kilo liters per person per year um i don 't think i need to dwell on this but one of the issues of the city eating into a biodiversity hotspot is you create a very long linear edge between um areas of bush land which are vulnerable to bushfire and new suburbs which becomes very difficult to police so we had the you know we 've had a series of infernos the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canberra the disastrous 2009 black saturday fires and of course the mega the mega fires of the 2021 summer uh you know it start to push in on this kind of suburban dream and again here we can see um mapping from the fire and emergency services a couple of years old showing bushfire vulnerable for fire prone areas in orange and we can see this new green field development eating into the into the biodiversity uh hotspot and also yielding tremendous fundamentality to bushfire um at the same time as as cities are bracing for the impact of climate change and experiencing it they 're becoming less affordable and less egalitarian so surging house prices in the city of melbourne um have kept australia near the top of the annual list of the world 's least affordable countries second only to hong kong the typical australian house cost 5.6 times the median household income so and sydney is the worst at least second least affordable city in the world with prices 12.2 times average incomes so we 're seeing an urban design a divide forming in our cities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels uh mapped onto purposes some years old now but you get a sense of stratification and concentration of deprivation um between many fringe suburbs and and some of the sort of golden triangle kind of suburbs as gene francis kelly from the gratton institute says one result is a new urban divide one that is changing australian challenging challenging long-held ideals of fairness there 's a growing gap between people who live near the center of our cities and those who live near the outer fringes and given that the the outer areas are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change it brings to mind the point that we 're not all in the anthropocene together we 're not all in the climate change disaster together to the same degree uh as has often made the point the poor and the dispossessed are far more on it than others so there 's an inequality there um at the same time that centrally located housing has become very unaffordable um providing transport options to the fringes have become also unaffordable leading to a decline in livability um so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of um quite alarmist rhetoric about peak oil well it turned out to be alarmist at least for the most recent decade but there isn 't you know we 're seeing this with the fuel price surges at the moment um that there are real issues um when there is very little public transport to the fringe about how you get around when petrol prices go up um you know we might all be zipping around in tesla 's now but according to my um survey today the cheapest tesla you could get in australia was 65 000 so the idea that particularly an outer suburban household who might have two or three cars are going to eco-modernize a whole fleet is not realistic at current prices um and obviously you know this doesn 't yet show the metronet diagram which helps to fill in some of these gaps between the radiating spokes of our transport system but obviously servicing a lot of these other areas with transport public transport has not proven easy and certainly hopefully the metronet diagram which is a good one will help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can 't read shows something concerning which is um essentially since 2012 public transit uses in perth has dropped off considerably particularly with the pandemic for obvious reasons but how you know i think particularly there 's a ongoing question of how we embed the train stations of metronet and existing train stations into a kind of mid-tier transport network which allows which feeds into those train stations remains a bit of an unanswered kind of question in perth one effect of relative isolation sometimes a lack of jobs punishing mortgage repayments and and some societal deprivation on the fringe can be the development of chronic mental health issues the australian philosopher glenn albrecht coined the term nostalgia to mean a form of distress caused by environmental change to describe the unhappiness of people whose landscapes are being transformed about them by forces beyond their control such as climate change he proposed this new term to describe this distinctive kind of homesickness and certainly when we look at levels of psychological distress we can see uh certainly there 's you know um some some city center situations like in fremont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat a kind of um a compounding of that in outer suburbs so obviously there is you know these other factors are being brought to bear on people 's mental health and well-being um and obviously this is not limited to perth the world health organization has predicted the depression um will be the second most devastating disease in the world by the mid uh 2020s uh and certainly you know some of our suburbs are harbingers in that respect so given these worrying issues facing fringe development how we 're reacting typically it 's been through urban densification hopefully in slightly better forms than what you 're seeing here so based on urban density being considered a crew lever for achieving sustainability outcomes across the nation um about 60 of all future development is meant to be infill development which is density within the city uh as opposed to new suburbs on the fringe in reality we don 't achieve nearly any uh nearly half of that uh and in much of much of the infill we do particularly in perth is just the small scale of suburban conversions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know into what we call you know villas or duplexes or triplexes this is known as background infill so in the following section we 've attempted to appraise scientifically this kind of background interference we 're delivering in perth and to see whether it 's delivering the kind of goals that we we 're seeking the compact city to deliver are we catching public transport more uh are we more connected to nature are we walking more are we more healthy these are all open questions which i 'll um attempt to embrace you know engage within the next section of the talk so we do it via mapping so here you can see perth 's what 's called the central sub-region and planning speak this grey line and the little black dots are all the new lots which have been created since 2010 when we directions 2031 came out big plan for urban densification um and what we find here is with this mapping that all these little dots which are suburban subdivisions most of them are not near regional open space where you get your most pure experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you huge mental and physical health benefits but most of this density is not occurring anywhere near regional open space which is concerning most of it is occurring however nearer to um little public open spaces i.e parks and we can see them here in green and we can see that the areas of background and phil are reasonably well served by those parts excuse me [Music] and this is important particularly in in terms of making our cities more comfortable in terms of microclimate parks can produce what 's called a park cool island effect so they help to cool the areas around to some degree the problem in perth is according to data from the now defunct center of built environment health that our parks generally in perth and with lots of exceptions but as a general characterization a lot of them have not been upgraded systematically to kind of provide the amenity that people living at a higher density might see so when we look at the the kind of ubiquitous parks in perth 's core um 22 percent have no trees according to this data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks have a ubiquitous underlay of reticulated turf poorly suited to perth drying climate 54 have no walking paths so you know this is an example we did some time lapse photography at parks not far from where i live in bayswater um and it shows a minimal engagement with the park uh some days this is not always the case but there 's just a question here whether these parks could be performing more ecosystem services which is the benefits nature provides people but also being more multifunctional and to provide you know sort of communal backyards for instance for people who are living at a higher density you might not much have much access to green space it 's been a lot of talk about urban forest canopy cover and here we can see um again background infill in black with urban forests overlaid and really it 's been the suburbs which have really um i guess shoulder the burden of infill development perth which have the lowest urban canopy cover i 'm thinking places like belmont and thinking places like um blaze water whereas when you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good at resisting density uh urban forest canopy cover you know is up around 40 so it 's a lot higher one of the reasons for this is 60 of trees generally on private land and most local governments don 't have statutory protection of trees so when you redevelop the tree it just gets knocked over and we 've seen that across the cross perth middle ring suburbs this is the kind of happy leaf leafy green suburban i grew up in and um this is what it 's becoming now you know there 's a certain view which um is that um that that urban canopy is just it 's the parsley on the pig it 's just the trimmings but the problem is the urban forests are so important for yielding ecosystem services they regulate the local climate they sequester carbon they purify water they provide habitats to plants and animals and they clean the air and a whole host of physical health and mental health benefits which i 'll get into in time and you know when we look at these middle ring suburbs and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of the suburbs where there has been quite a lot of density physical inactivity is quite high reflecting the fact that people are likely um you know often the streetscapes are not ones that really would excite you to get out and go for a walk but also that public transport is you know is not available and when we look at a lot of this density in these inner northern suburbs it 's between these you know in the kind of wide segment between these radiating spokes of heavy rail of course they 're much better served by buses but our bus system tends to emphasize coverage at the cost of frequency and legibility of the service so there might be a station nearby or bus stop but the likelihood that you 'll bother waiting in the full sun in the middle of summer for a bus is pretty low for most people and it certainly is for me and we can see that in when we look at car dominance the amount of people who drive to work is is pretty high in some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the idea that infield will lead to people catching public transport and getting out of the car is not necessarily happening now of course this form of infill is not really what the state government are promoting as their flagships for infill development these pimples are activity centers perth has a host of activity centres where density is meant to be happening it 's just proven a real challenge it 's not easy to corral development uh within a dashed line and typically it 's just you know it 's dispersing in this more ad hoc kind of manner so this policy has been a struggle even though the ambition of it i think is is is bang on um so you know like a little field survey i guess of some of the forms of density in the middle ring suburbs uh the view from my roof um and then kelly that 's all about the slot and you get it so the problem with a lot of this is um we 're losing the leafy greenness of suburbia in middle middle ring suburbs but we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban conditions which incubate urban life and the cafes and the restaurants and the bars and the street life and the buzz and hum and the ambience and the problem is in many cases what we 're delivering is something which is stranded between those two poles in the middle and to some ways of thinking is the worst of all worlds as a result of some of these issues around australia about 13 percent of people support infill development in their neighborhood according to the gratton institute and i think that you know it 's been described there as a public solemnness in relation to infill development education campaigns have had some effect and people are generally aware of the issues of sprawl but that doesn 't necessarily mean they 're going to sign up for density in their neighborhood the british sociologist peter maris argued that people cannot reconcile themselves to the loss of familiar attachment in terms of some impersonal utilitarian calculation of the common good such as avoiding sprawl while people might recognize that sprawl has its issues that is not necessarily going to cause them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their own personal environment because people 's identity and their well-being is tied to the unique character and of their neighborhood and and and their access to nature that their suburb and their their lot and their street provides you know so there 's there 's good reasons that communities are often resisting in film people call them nimbys not in my backyards another term is bananas which just build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything um which certainly is you know pretty accurate in some suburbs i 'm going to do a little bit of shameless promotion here we 're running a survey at the moment which is called the density my way survey and basically it 's asking people in their neighborhood not so much do you support density or not that question is being done to death but in what forms could you consider supporting it and what would the triggers be that would either cause you to oppose it or support it this is just a little excerpt from the survey but it asks people you know would you prefer density around the train station here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is you know do you like the idea of colonizing these these main roads and turn them turning them into urban corridors bustling with life and cafes and things or do you like the idea of upgrading parks which might be at the moment just boring sort of recreation spaces and actually densifying around a park which is a multi-functional backyard for the people living around it or do you just like this sort of distant this gradual disembowelment of the suburbs where you densify in suburban backyards you you kind of disperse it in a way that it 's not too noticeable and it 's all one or two story um and as long as you don 't appear beyond the front fence too much nothing much appears to have changed but we know there 's some issues with that so this is a fairly unprecedented survey and welcome your involvement in it i don 't mean to prompt your reactions but what we 're finding is communities actually support um density and precincts where you do it in a targeted way and then you leave the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens is not raining well but it 's early days and i 'll be really interested to see your responses so this has been a really relentless um relentlessly negative talk uh in the first two so i 'll try and um inject a little bit of hope here so this brings me to the central question of the third part of the talk today so what could be an australian dream for the challenges presented by this urban century how could we remake our cities as lifeboats for humanity in the climate crisis we are in and will continue to be in brenda gleason implores we have a chance of surviving the climate crisis and even living well but for that to be possible we have to make our lifeboats seaworthy now what are our lifeboats they are surely the cities the few cities in which most of our population are science cities the source of many problems of overproduction and over consumption of which climate threat is the greatest example can be recons conceived as escape rafts during the painful journey to a new climate regime so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for humanity in the storm we 're in and here we 're going to um we 're bastardizing a diagram by ebenezer howard who 's a famous sort of anarchic planner from the early 20th century he came up with the idea of the garden cities which was bringing together the best things of towns and the best things of country or nature and then introduce splicing these two things in a joyous union between town and country so what we 're essentially doing with our model which is called green space orientated development is taking the leafy greenness and access to nature of suburbia which you know it 's expressed preference of most australians frankly and we 're trying to hybridize that in a joyous union with transit orientated development which is density around transit which is what the state government is trying to do so the idea of god is it could look something like this um so where todd this is a train station just down here where one is there 's another one there transit orientated development which is what we 're trying to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hub makes sense people there catch the trend maybe they don 't any cars as much maybe their carbon emissions go down accordingly so it makes a lot of sense but the idea here is actually you spread things out a little bit so that they are within a sort of 15 minute walk of a train station perhaps not a five minute walk but a five minute cycle or electric scoot um upgrade the parks and densify around them not in them at a higher density so there 's people living around them have access to the nature of the park so it 's called green space orientated development you probably won 't be able to quite read the text in this but it 's based on the presumption and the understanding the densified urban form is provided a lot of benefits by upgraded parks okay so if you live around a park you 'll likely have improved physical health even if you just look at nature even if you just look at the park and don 't go in it because we 're not designed to live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body is able to recover from life stresses been a lot of experiments on people um recovering from operations being put in hotel hospital rooms either say overlooking a freeway or overlooking a landscape courtyard and there 's a difference a market difference in recovery time because you relax when you look at nature and the body can recover improve mental health which goes with being in nature increased social cohesion um carbon sequestration these are all benefits the park is providing that densified urban area local climate regulation we talked about park cool island effect which is the areas around the park are cooler because the vegetation is evapotranspiring water into the air which cools it and also providing some shade it 's purifying the air which is good if you like breathing and it 's purifying water as it goes into the aquifer which is good if you like drinking but what hasn 't been talked about so much is the benefits such as you getting god of densifying the urban precinct to the park so you get passive surveillance in the park um so people look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park maintenance you can involve the community around it looking after the park it activates the park and if we get organized things like nutrients can be used for communal composting in the park and also even grey water systems redirected towards park irrigation so there 's all kinds of synergies with god now transit orientated development has the synergy if you live near a train you might use it for transport that 's a good synergy but we would argue god potentially provides even more this is before a lot of our parks in the middle ring suburb are a product of the 1950s recreation movement which is all about making us physically healthy and and having active recreation also temper are supposedly immoral in impulses so our parks are often these kind of turf desert with a scattering of trees sports over ovals are really important i don 't denigrate their importance but you know is there a way of using them more efficiently is there a way of you know of getting of delivering a form of god where you have multifunctional oval spaces but then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide different people living around it to use at different times in different ways so much more multifunctional uh more urban wetlands more walking paths heaps more uh tree canopy coverage which would spin off into the streets and the idea here you might not be able to see it carefully but it 's just this idea of a 15-minute walk from train stations which is that little black dot upgrading these parks make them more multifunctional make them better for biodiversity and better for humans and also much more resilient to a changing climate perhaps a little unfair but i have to say this looks fairly familiar uh in perth and then after and the thing about the density is you don 't necessarily really notice it too much in the end because the trees reduce not the density but the perceived density which has been shown to be decreased when you plant trees around apartment buildings um here 's a detail of this what we call the loose fish space so you would actually work with the community to find out what are the functions they 're really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know beach volleyball is it is it trampolines is it a skate park is it an area to exercise dogs is is it a community garden all of these functions can be rotated through this kind of multifunctional space and then you need to stitch it all together so the idea here that this is the train station that you create a filigree network of of upgraded streets which are really well shaded um and which are not car dominated which allow people to get from the identified precincts around the parks back to the train stations so rather than the train stations kind of dropping you in a car park which is often the case now here it plugs you into a second level network um which is you know totally viable for both biodiversity and bikes and e-bikes and scooters and e-scooters and all of those things to zip along so they become a network of sort of linear parks okay so look by way of conclusion we 've we 've looked at the problems of sprawl um which are many and real we 've looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dealing with so many issues with facing this ball but we find that actually the way we 're delivering it in many cases is compounding issues around climate resilience you know um and the pandemic you know hasn 't helped the spanish flu irrigated waves of suburban expansion in australia in the early 20th century such as we can see pictured here you know our cities are some of the most spread in the world we tend to see that as a unique australian kind of issue it 's not around the world um the u.n has indicated that between 2000 2015 in almost all regions of the world the expansion of urbanized land outpaced the growth of urban populations so that means cities are now sprawling faster than they are actually growing a population i and the pandemic has certainly and a lot of the stimulus programs around australian cities and greenfield development suburban development have irrigated further waves of suburban sprawl so it 's incumbent on upon us to find creative ways of delivering density better um so the green space orientated developments the book i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about how we can reconcile the leafy greenness of suburbia with the density of of cities um so thanks for listening i you know i really appreciate the opportunity i appreciate um you guys kind of hanging in there um i really would more than looking at the book i 'd love it if you could do our survey it 's called density my way and i really stand ready both now uh and in the survey to be told what i 've said about density is wrong and why and we 're really interested in those opinions um so i will stop sharing now and uh yeah really really happy to take your questions great thanks julian no problem oh you 're back here good one thanks for that okay so we 'll just um open up now for anyone to either write a question in the in the chat function um or if you 're more comfortable you 'd like to ask it um on the screen then you can use the hand function which is under the reactions at the top there 's a little raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to julian uh he 's he 's already approved that 's okay um all right so we 'll go to the first person with their hand up which is miller um hi miller i 'll uh oh i can 't oh here i am cooking dinner um well first of all thank you for um the amazing talk um i 'm a healthcare worker so a lot of these terms just went right over my head but i 'm really yeah i i loved that you included the psychological um impacts especially on children um i work at the children 's hospital in neurology um and we find that um yeah the the beds are all uh facing outwards towards king 's park and there 's a very good reason for that um and we also use green colors um all the doctors that i work with had um input in colors and yeah we used some of the wreaths that you mentioned um i guess my question is a lot of people my age now um in their mid-thirties are you know struggling to afford a home um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the um sort of apartment living and a place that came to mind is probably on your drive to work which is the uh old perth children 's hospital site um yeah and so you know with how do you view those kinds of sites where um kind of where people that are normal normally councils are like city of subiaco in like really um wealthy areas have sort of like pushed density back for so many years um how do you how do you see those areas kind of expanding in the future acting on their density requirements but also keeping the green spaces like really you know importantly active thank you there 's a really good question milo and part of the problem is when you can 't assemble enough land because the city land ownership in the city is so fragmented and in the suburbs even trying to get two neighbors together to develop their lots together is next to impossible so you end up working with these tiny fragments and you can 't do anything much and when you do try and do something it typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move so i 'm a big supporter of where we do have sites where there is a bit of room to move and i guess the old peer match site is one of those where we got a consolidated land holding that you really try and go for it and and what we don 't want to do is undercook it where you come back in a few years and go geez ah we really should have gone a bit harder there you know so where there is a manatee and where there is parkland and there 's access to transport my personal feeling is you should go pretty hard so you don 't get stranded in this middle ground um and unfortunately that 's been the fate of so many um you know middle ring suburbs where they 've just they 're not really urban and they 're not really suburban now and they 're uncomfortably in the middle um so look i think we have amenity my answer would be really go for it but of course you know inappropriate forms great thank you thanks mila for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peter devereux thanks uh pierre i would like to defer to catherine b because it 's so wonderful to see a young person on the screen so maybe give catherine the starting thanks no problem good one uh catherine um do you do you know how to unmute your microphone yep would you like to ask a question uh yeah i wanted to ask a a student like myself how could you contribute in your school community and home well there 's so much you can do in your home and it 's a it 's a great question i think [Music] you know just the act of planting a tree in your garden can be such a such a beneficial thing um i just play i 'm not much of a gardener and when i moved into my house we planted a whole bunch of mini ghost gums beautiful white garden trees and every year when it blooms there 's just thousands of bees there 's birds going every it 's a riot of life and i just sit there and i sit up there and i look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that really took me maybe two or three hours to plant i never really watered them i just let them do their thing and i think if all the things i 'll do in my career nothing will be quite as beneficial nothing will be as amazing as those seven trees and all the little lives that swirl around them so i think um these little a little thing like that over time and replicated across the city is just a revolution you know that 's what i would do and i would encourage your school to do it there 's a lot of problems with kids being obese there 's a lot of problems with kids not walking to school and i re i think um you know lobbying the local government to say and and the education department to say we want big trees in our schools we want beautiful trees lining the streets leading into the school you know i think to put a bit of pressure on them to say there 's nothing more important than our children like you and and then being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds how do we make strengths which really enable that um but they 're just my thoughts from a middle-aged man and happy to hear your thoughts brilliant thanks thanks so much catherine good on you that was great that was awesome um okay uh so the next on the order was yeah back to uh councillor deborah yeah thanks so much uh how wonderful to have uh yeah a young person uh on the call that 's really terrific so great that you can make the time catherine um fantastic uh and one of the things i guess i remember when i was young was walking to school um and so i think yeah getting other kids to think about walking to school have a school walking bus or you know encourage other kids even if you have one day a year when everyone thinks how are we going to get to school you know i think that 's uh really important because often those behaviors start at school in terms of how you get there i had two and thanks so much julian really enjoyed your talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're facing at the moment in the town of victoria park which is around um the the stations and with the elevated rail coming to our area and other council areas bordering us one of the things we are looking at is having more green space along what used to be the place where the rail is but also potentially costs associated with maintaining a new new those new green spaces and i know there is a lot of research around the world that says mixed use around stations make uh make transport more viable but it also brings income into the community but i wonder how we can encourage the grant public transport authority and the government to really take those opportunities more seriously because it seems with metronet that 's not a given that there will be mixed use allowed around the stations and yet it 's so fundamental that was one the second one just quickly was and i was glad you came to this in your god bit and i love the the god uh angle that 's lovely but yeah just thinking about and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connectors between transport and homes and that sort of thing and green lines there but it seemed to be a little bit underemphasized and yet to me seems so important for example for addressing biodiversity corridors and active transport along those routes we want to have trees both for people be able to commute but also for biodiversity corridors thanks so much yeah our pleasure look in terms of delivering mixed use around trans transit one of the issues is it relates to the governments and i 'm sure you 're across it but you have the public transit authority and they 're all about rail patronage and you have the department of planning and they 're trying to stitch the um the stations into the surrounding fabric often often when it just comes down to getting these things built the focus goes on the station and what 's going on around it kind of just doesn 't really happen or it takes a long time to happen um and often i mean the public transport authority have kind of they do have codes for how much parking needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fact that we 're also building a lot of train stations in freeway medians means it 's really hard once all that 's been done to try and stitch it into the urban fabric and i really take your point about those mid-tier connections between the train station and the surrounding urban areas and we need to think you know like this a person walks out of their house in the morning and it 's 36 degrees and their cars just sitting there and they go oh geez that looks pretty good and then they look at the street and there 's no there 's no trees there 's no shade they know they 're going to walk down the street with no shade across a massive road across a huge car park with very little shade to get to a train station um and it 's going to be a very rare person who goes i 'm not just going to hop in that metal box that 's sitting there in my driveway which is beautifully comfortable and air conditioned and i think it is about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those connections can be so um so dignified and comfortable that people go you know i will walk and i just think in most of our precincts in the areas around them we 're not anywhere near that um so i i don 't necessarily have the answer but but uh obviously i think uh we need to be attentive to those conditions and we 're really not at the moment great thanks thanks julian good one thank you councillor devro for the question uh well now next on the list was councillor wilfred hendricks uh miller i thinks camilla you 're still there are you able to mute yourself sorry thanks uh councillor hendrix your question thank you peer my questions um to do with you mentioned julian like it 's how to get two people or two blocks to join together i 'm thinking bigger what 's the chances or possibilities of getting a whole suburban block and actually create a a beautiful urban village i suppose on that block [Music] and i 'm sure that 'll be a success and that could then be a a catalyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole metro area um just a thought just an idea is something that feasible possible yeah i mean it 's an enticing idea isn 't it because if you take that whole that whole block then you can really get serious with it you know um because you have room to move you 've got room to keep mature trees you can work around them a bit you know the problem i mean in a way that 's a little bit back to the 1960s where we had you know in 70s we had the big redevelopment areas and an area whole area suburbs would be would be plowed under and you would then you know go in there with development it i think it 's pretty difficult to do in terms of trying to orchestrate that just because you 're dealing with so many small land holdings but it is it remains the the holy grail is land amalgamation to get a decent slice of earth if you look at one example is the development in white gum valley which development wa did which is a medium density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i i 'm not advocating the redevelopment schools in any way but when you look at if you google that you can see what you can actually do when you have one consolidated land holding and i think it 's a bit like what you 're saying then you can start to deliver um you know precinct renewable energy grids you can start to recycle gray water on a bigger scale you know you can do all these things at a precinct level that you can 't really do when you just muck it around lots a lot a lot so yes you know a big issue i i mean i have some sympathy with moving a little bit back towards the 1960s model where where they 're um where i guess there is more power to orchestrate redevelopment areas but of course if it was applied to my house you 'd see a whole different side of my um thinking just build it okay thanks thanks cam councillor hendrix okay next on the list i 'm gonna um dive in and just give this a go here is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you well look i 'm i 'm just really excited about everything i 've heard tonight um i 'm a local resident i 'm on hampshire street um and i have one um comment for um with catherine um catherine our first um inquiry today and um look there 's uh millennium kids they 're doing wonderful work um in the climate action space um and and that includes um urban greening as well and um they have um citizen science programs going as well so if you want to connect with millennium keith that 'll be awesome and um for dr balter and pierre i am really interested in inactivating um some of the green areas that we have around here and you 've mentioned a wood that keeps coming back and that 's connectivity um one of the main issues um identified as a global risk is that social fracturing and lack of social connectivity and particularly more now with um the the isolation um of the pandemic so the i just wonder do you guys have an idea about bringing local residents together and um working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those parks do you have any thoughts on that pierre did you want to have a go at that or you 're happy for me too uh maybe you go first and then i 'll plug some things well we 'll look um vil de liz if i 'm saying that right sorry if i 'm not um so sociability and community connection has been measured around the world in terms of its correlation with the provision of green space and where you have more green space you typically have more community um interaction and things going on so so there 's a there 's a you know obvious an obvious correlation there um i think partly it 's because when people are in green space whether it 's streets or parks they 're more relaxed and when you 're more relaxed you 're more inclined to speak to people i think you know in a lot of our fairly degraded streetscapes and things you 're not that comfortable you 're not that relaxed um and i think that that leads to a situation where people um don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing buildings too is almost designed to destroy sociability i mean really where you have i 've heard them called snout houses in america there was a lady who came up with names for different housing types where you have got a big big double car garage bang on the street drive in there automatic door comes down and you 're into your you 're in front of your screen in the living room um so it 's almost like we 're designing the suburban streets to kill that sort of casual social life you know that goes with just just coming home and going out again and i think um we really should be reconsidering our cities in terms of sociability you 're right the pandemic is seeing people isolate and i think um we need to entice them out back into public spaces parks and streets in which there 's a dignity and there 's a comfort and there 's an access to nature and also a multi-functionality like if i think i live in bayswater the local park near me if i got a book and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot sun and sat under one of the few trees and read a book i would be considered suspicious at best strange maybe no stranger best suspicious at worst you know and that just shows how you know i 'm a middle-aged white man like i 'm meant to own this whole city right but i don 't feel comfortable even doing that and i think if i don 't feel comfortable there must be many others who are not so how do we make those parks something where you could do that and feel comfortable and i just think it 's about multifunctionality we should do needs based assessments of the people living around parks to go actually not what do we have but what do we want you know like you know is there a possibility of balancing active recreation which is essentially kicking hitting balls around with other forms of connecting with nature and socializing and other forms of use so as a roundabout question a roundabout answer to your question but i think the way the way we design cities won 't make people socialize it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll certainly help and it 'll it could catalyze i think a lot of these interactions which we 're losing through bad design yeah so i might um jump in to sort of say do you remember when does everyone remember the the the deep lockdowns that that we had and we were given 30 minutes of you know outdoor time and that was probably one time when it wasn 't weird to be reading in a park because everyone sort of clustered there and joined and i feel like they perhaps you know i 'm prone to being an optimist but but perhaps the the value of parks with has been um felt in the last couple of years a bit more and and of a lot of parks but big green open space so i 'm optimistic of the increased social life of of those of those spaces and we can keep designing them that way everything that julian said those time lapse photos of that that empty all or just lawn sort of park um you know is not going to attract anyone so i might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been trying um with the with the urban forest strategy as we as we roll that out one of the things is we 've been creating micro parks at the front of uh sump sumpland and what we 've done is for those particular ones we 've only invited the people on the street hasn 't been a whole town invite uh to come down and actually do the planting stage of of that often it 's really planting it out and i 've found that they 've been some of the greatest experiences that i 've had has been at those because you know we 've we 've done the full the full community ones which is great you get people meet each other from there the full vic park community and that 's that 's good but when it 's everyone just on the street it felt like it was just a social occasion and people were meeting their neighbors and it was just a great great way of doing that and then these little spaces the best maintained piece of green space in town is um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs his hose over and and waters the the um little micro part we 've done and pulls pulls the weeds out and um and i just love that so i think we that those sorts of things can be can be done more and trying to involve the community in them and they then they 're engaged they feel the ownership and they keep keep coming to coming back yeah so we 'll go to the next question if that 's all right so the next one uh we have carl are you there carl yes hi can you hear me yes we can so fantastic let me know how you talk about it um uh just to resurrect what everyone else has said brilliant presentation julian thank you um you mentioned about 60 percent i think it was of trees are on private land and the key issue there being the lack of statutory protection for those trees um i don 't live in um vic park but i live in a perth suburb built in the 60s where um houses were small blocks were large and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i 've i guess as i 've aged i 've actually noted that whenever i see a uh you know the ravens or the red-tailed cockatoos or the bubble cows at night and the kookaburras make pies etc i don 't have statistical numbers but almost every time you see them they are in the indigenous trees in the in the mari the jarrah they 're not in all the other trees that we plant around so it 's really easy to go and say oh there 's lots of greenery here but it doesn 't necessarily from a bird perspective have that food or the nesting sites or whatever and and i guess um i 'll come to my questions so i probably said what i what i 'm seeing is i 'm in in a suburb as i said in the 60s you have every few weeks you have another house knocked over and rebuilt but it 's not just the house is rebuilt it 's that the whole block is white it 's just sand it 's denuded um and and sometimes sometimes you get two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least then you 're you can go well i 'm saving some land out in the on the periphery being cleared but generally all you 're going to get is a instead of 130 meter square half square meter house you go and get a 400 square meter house just get them um but then whilst the housing stock turns over so too does the trees and hence you know the only requirement is and this is where i 'm coming to the question the only requirement that i 'm seeing for my council is that well if you knock down a you know if you don 't leave one big original tree then you have to put a two meter seedling in basically which which can 't possibly compare to the you know the benefits of 100 year old gerritry for example so the question therefore is what can we people do to to prompt council prompt local governments or whoever that there 's a there 's a currency there 's a value to yes we want to have the infill but where do how do we get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of you know but you know so there 's a as i understand you know you can go through planning permission it goes and says oh you need to keep this tree and they keep the tree and then they come down the next day you know it 's what we know if the blocks are divided they get the they get the title so the requirement of subdivision is they need to keep the tree and as soon as they get the two titles they can cut it down the next day and then build whatever they want how do we get these this poor mechanisms um fixed yeah look i i a very good question carl i have to say it 's not my expertise exactly but it should be so this is a really big failure of mine we worked though a few years ago in what was called the fremantle alternative so you have the r codes right which are the residential design codes which dictate the infield outcomes you get in the situations you 're talking about we got up an amendment to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had things like a maximum site cover so you could only build a fairly small building and you had to leave quite a lot of area of deep soil there was mandated deep soil areas so even if a tree was knocked down you could definitely plant a decent one there so there are controls which are in place which can help with that i i would get you to point your local government towards the design wa medium density infill guide which i have to say is really good on on the you know the protection and also the encouragement of mature tree planting so i think there is a kind of that policy is ushered in a mood shift from from the state government so there are things like that which you can begin to lean on but in terms of making changes to the actual regulations which allow developer to do that i 'm not so good at what the triggers are there to enable that the problem is in australia the the right to do whatever you want with your private land is something that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdividing the back garden is our kind of birthright and we and we build our you know retirement planning around being able to do that and if there 's a tree in the way well then that 's unfortunate um so it requires a kind of general mood shift i think where we actually consider the public good over the private interest and you know in a very neoliberal society like ours that 's not an easy thing to get up um but certainly other cities have done it and you know it would probably be worth doing a case study analysis of of how they 've gone about it and how they 've sold it to the public you know yeah um yeah pierre do you have anything you can add to that or anyone else in government yeah yeah i um i can we have been i guess um digging around trying to um trying to figure this out as as well because there has been uh desire from the community like like selfie expressed to us uh and also from our our counselors um and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it there 's sort of a bit of a requirement for a some state level um uh legislation or at least participation in in in the com in that conversation um i 've seen this few legal hurdles but we 're still progressing it and the significant tree list is is another like you 've mentioned it is a good way so you can create that but then how do you then protect those even those trees that are considered significant um and it seems like that you can do that through your town planning scheme so we 're doing our new town planning scheme at the moment and looking at including including that cena gets that that i guess statutory weight of the town planning scheme behind it um but yeah it enters sort of a bit of unknown legal legal territory when you start start going in there but it 's something that we 're still uh pushing pushing away at and it 's and it 's one of our actions in the urban forest strategy so so we are reporting against our progress against it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll try and get more questions in now that 's okay is that all good thank you yes thank you thanks thanks mate uh tracy rainford has been very patiently with a digital hand up um would you like to ask a question thanks hi thank you and thanks so much for your tour really enjoyed it um i 've been living in vic park only for about a year and um i guess you know my perception since being here is that you know we 've got some really good things going for us so obviously we 've got a really active and committed council are quite progressive compared to where i 've come from so i 'm really happy about that we 've got areas of high density we do seem to have sort of densities centered around albany highway but then really quite peaceful streets in other parts of the the town um we 've got i hadn 't heard about the burger project so that 's fantastic um the community garden lots of really cool things happening um but then there are also some areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree cover for the park is not great it 's only um it 's not uh sort of at standard um in some parts of the town are really hot like you just feel like you 're in a concrete jungle i 've described it as where you get you know you really need a lot more tree cover um and i guess i don 't want you to force you to bite the hand that might be feeding you but um if you were in charge of what would you do in vic park to make it better um i i 've got to be careful here not because i 'm worried about buying a hand i just i 'm just not really a crossfit park in particular but can i talk to the area the issues generically i think the problem is the the concrete jungle areas you identify there 's very little you can actually do once they 're built because you can 't get the mature trees in um you 're not going to be able it 's hard to retrofit them and also you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already fragmented enough and that development fragmented it even more you know into these little lots so the ability to unpick that in the future and to make it denser for instance or make it more biodiverse or whatever you want to do the horse is pretty much bolted and it 's going to be really really hard to do anything with that stuff so look i 'll go out and limb here but if i was in in charge what i would do would be to be very cautious about doing any more of that kind of development i would pretty much i would freeze those areas and go if we don 't have the impetus economic or whatever behind it to do density at a reasonable density which actually gives us some benefits let 's not do it at all let 's hold the line um now that requires a bit of patience and it requires i i guess um a bit of a bit of faith you know but what we don 't want to do now is squander opportunities by just carving them up and subdividing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit or near amenity in parks where in the future we come back and go we we sorry catherine i should be throwing um we really should have held the line here because if we did this now we would actually have the impetus to do it properly and unfortunately we squandered it we just squandered these opportunities so my answer to your question would almost be it 's more about what you don 't do even than what you do do at the moment you know because conditions will get to a point where we will be able to support decent apartment development let 's if we can 't do it now let 's wait you know now perth is coming out of its long real estate slumber so those conditions might be upon us pretty soon but obviously the pandemic is also working against density to some degree so you know it 's tricky but i i i guess in one sentence hold the line would be my answer on on background in phil right thank you so much brilliant thanks tracy i was hoping it would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that uh we have a question that 's been um sent into something just on the chat so the question is how can we get developers to build better form and carbon neutral buildings adaptable form yeah look what a great question i think um part of the problem we have at the moment is the development model for density i mean i 'm talking apartments here not background in phil um he is there 's a lot of costs which go with density and it 's not easy you know when when you look at when you go to a developer and go would you want to deal with this apartment development where you 're dealing with the possible resistance of community you 're dealing with unionized labor you 're dealing with the complexities of multi-story buildings you know are you willing to take that on compared to just you know subdividing suburban lots and doing single story which you know you can roll out which you don 't need to sell a whole bunch of the development of the apartments before you can even begin on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know are real and lead to developers going you know what it 's easier just to do background infill or even better just do suburban sprawl because that is a model we can just roll out without any problems so to ask them to do more is really is difficult you know in terms of being carbon neutral and adaptable but that is what we have to do and i think you know there 's a role for government for development wa to lead the way and to show you know how we can build buildings in an innovative way i think of developments like lights for you in adelaide where they 're doing um three-story timber built apartments where even the lift core is done in timber you know and a lot of the problems with density is i think people people fear it because they haven 't experienced good examples of what it can be so we need you know in this i would suggest and if you don 't already have it in a typical local government area you need a couple of really good examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is great obviously for sequestering carbon adaptable buildings by building light weight like that you are actually more adaptable than traditional masonry construction and i think what we need to do is go in the local government with development wa and actually deliver a couple of pilot projects which are really good and which actually are kind of tailored to the local community in some way you know and then you then you open them up and get people they can walk in it they can touch it they can feel it they can experience the spaces and they go yes i could live in this because i think people are at a point now there 's so many architectural renders floating around out there that people don 't trust them anymore and they 're seeing good-looking apartment buildings on the billboard turn into things which are pretty hard work and reality so i think you know a couple of pilot projects which could really um turn things around and it also proved to the development industry that by de-risking it by getting government involved to help deliver them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not um it 's not too complicated we can find the labor you know the skilled labor are required to build it uh and i think um pilot projects would be my simple answer to what is a very complex question around development feasibility great thanks thanks julian uh we have another one on the chat from wendy morris says thank you so much julian for your inspiring talk i live in the hills and i worry about the urban sprawl in kalamunda and les murdie area huge houses on small blocks with plastic lawns and palm trees this is our beautiful rural environment um well okay how do you see the fringe well that 's i guess that 's the question around the fruit around the fringe and how development occurs out there that 's perhaps not um standard sprawl or sensitive sort of development yeah the fringe is really hard you know because we we want to make our city denser and more compact so we 're delivering this what 's new urbanist inspired this is a new urbanism supports a compact city model so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed in on small lots it 's actually a bit like background you feel it 's just done in a greenfield situation and you know that produces all kinds of issues with a lot of black roofs without many trees with artificial turf you know the thing just radiates heat so urban heat island effect can be really bad in those areas which is just the urban areas get hot and they stay hot through the through the night and we know what a killer heat stress can be um so i personally think and this is a bit of an out there response but i actually think we should be looking rather than just the binary of sprawl versus infield which we 're both seeing are quite problematic you know at a bigger scale and over the longer term we need to look at population decentralization you know which is is back to the 1970s for those who are around to remember the gough whitlam government had all kinds of plans for growth centres in the regions to be connected via rail and whatever back to the capitals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city focused myopic view where it 's just all about the city you know and you know there 's plenty of room out there and with the appropriate infrastructure nbn and fast rail there 's no reason that we couldn 't actually have you know populations in the regions which are really well connected back to the capital city in those ways particularly given we 've been untethered from our offices with a pandemic so by doing that you would take the pressure off the fringes of perth and you might actually mean you can build a decent suburb like we used to rather than these horrible kind of um part suburb part not suburb kind of things we 're building at the moment and i 'm not surprised to kick back in the hills because they 've seen what 's happened to the flat earthers and they you know in many cases i think they don 't like it and you know it 's hard not to sympathize with that for you great thanks thanks julian okay we 're probably um getting close to the end but i might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see julian the the role of of big park in the broader perth uh challenge how do you where do you see vic park in that i see it as a local government um which i should say i don 't know well but you guys i mean like in terms of good bones you guys have got everything right you 've got heavy rail you 've got an urban corridor which is not necessarily an arterial road i know there 's a lot of cars in albany highway but you 've got shepherd and road and whatever taking the pressure off that so you 've got opportunities for a good corridor you have obviously an engaged community um you have you know great it 's very multicultural um so in terms of landscape you 've got the river you 've got beautiful parks and and natural systems to graft onto you have great bones in terms of transport and opportunities for density and you 've got an engaged you know informed community um so i reckon uh if indeed it 's not already victoria park should be leading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can 't do it there where can you do it you know um so uh yeah and obviously you know and hearing the work that you guys have been doing it sounds really inspiring and i think a lot of the issues i 've raised today um are not new you know to to to the planners at victoria park i 'm sure so there 's awareness of the issues and i think um you know i i have high hopes for victoria park leading the way and again if you can 't do it there where can you do it brilliant okay that 's a really really great way to um to end end the night so we 'll wrap it up there on that inspiring note that vic park is going to to lead the way um and i might just add to that that there was quite a lot of surveys done uh and and it 's repeatedly been the message back from the community around density in victoria park um and the community is focused on the birdswood peninsula which has train station and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along albany highway that was already mentioned in that sort of urban village type style and then the public transport nodes with with metronet as our big big opportunity sort of cluster around there so i feel like with that kind of message from our community we 're i guess aligned to to a lot of what you 've you 've mentioned there um in your talk talk today and hopefully we can lead lead the way around doing density right right good and just by the way in terms of doing density right density my way the survey please do it and and we will take it to the wapc in department of planning and everything so um your thoughts will be aired and i 'll stop promoting it now the the link is on the chat for anyone who wants to just click it and just do it straight away while you 're all uh in in the mode um and if not we 'll be promoting it on our um town channels as part of the wrap up for this this event okay thanks everyone thanks julian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paying us a visit and uh thanks everyone for for um getting involved tonight it was really really great i loved it and i hope you all did too thank you everyone cheers thanks have a great evening please bite thank you see you later bye everybody see ya excellent thank you so much see you around thank you julian i 'll be pestering you via email wonderful you

impartiality interest and item thirteen point five councillor bronwen if impartiality interest thank you mr ceo okay so our public participation time i have a list of questions our first question from our public is from graham first at what are the following amounts in the financial accounts form the first one is on the 16th of december 2021 nick haynes signed painter 1100 and on the 22nd of january 2022 nick haynes signed painter 1100 and on the 6th of january 22 boston brewing code for 990 i would now ask um luke ellis our acting chief financial officer please to respond uh thank you deputy mayor good evening everyone uh i 'll work through them in order uh the first uh payment to mick haynes relates to chalk wall painting for christmas the second to the same person was for talk wall painting in relation to afl finals uh and the third payment to boston brewery was for off-site training and review session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dallas okay the next set of questions i have ten questions and they are from mr vince maxwell and i will go through them one by one and ask for a response before i move to the next question so the first one with reference to the attachment 14 3 1 the annual budget review of 2021 to 2022 final page 8 employment expenses salaries and increase the rates 17 000 so please provide an explanation of what this amount is for i 'll now ask mr luke ellis our acting financial officer uh thank you again uh the 17 000 increase relates to salaries year-to-date and that 's in relation to additional hours and overtime required for the underground power projects are currently being conducted in the town thank you mr ellis our next question it 's from page 8 note 2 professional services expenses increase predominantly relates to additional parking contract services of 196 100. please provide an explanation of what work this additional parking contract services relates to mr ellis thank you the increase in parking from parking contract services is largely offset by a reduction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenditure and will be addressed through next year 's annual budget thank you mr ellis uh the next question from mr maxwell is on page eight and it 's note 4 it 's program expenses an increase in expenses due to security services at the life of 50 000 leisure life of 50 000 the library of 30 000 and customer services of 20 000. the total of these four items is 150 000. please explain what these additional security services were used for mr ellis uh mr i 'd like to call on luke ellis our acting chief financial officer oh sorry my apologies uh the budget amendments all relate to the same type of expenditure and that is for concierge services supplied by a third-party security firm working in those town buildings related to covert 19 vaccine mandate checking thank you and our next question is on page 9 note 15 non-operating revenue transfer from reserve reduction in transfer from reserve of 121 and 28 this is described as a savings from budget to pay out rrfa exit fees what is the total cost of the exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may direct this question for an explanation from our finance manager mr billingham thank you deputy mayor the raffa exit fee came in under budget at 7.083 million dollars we budgeted 7.21 million the saving is the difference between the original budget and the year today actually received hence the reserve fund will have a saving and the operating expenditure will have savings so there 's a new effect on the rate setting statement it 's uh it 's all covered by the two thank you thank you mr billingham okay the next question is on page 54 operations waste services capital expenses furniture and equipment of 417 000 the three beam system was known about before the annual budget was set why wasn 't this amount for additional bins already in the budget acting chief financial officer mr luke ellis i thank you i may also direct this to mr billingham thank you mr don thank you deputy mayor the three bin system was programmed for delivery in august 2022 that is into next financial year and again the current 2122 budget has no provision for purchasing a bins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this financial year the reason this item is bringing it forward in the budget review is we have experienced service for supply chain issues with purchase of goods and services due to covert so i believe mr wong has requested in the budget to bring forward part of that money for the bins this year so we can get them ordered now in time for them to be rolled out in august next financial year thank you thank you mr billingham um actually there 's another question here in relation to the topic uh why isn 't there a separate line item for the bins instead of including this significant cost into furniture and equipment would i be directing that to mr billingham or our acting chief financial officer mr billingham please yeah mr gillingham please thank you deputy mayor the line item is for capital expenditure with we 're buying the bins in bulk so we 're going to capitalize them against furniture and equipment that 's the best balance sheet category to put them into we don 't have line items in the balance sheet just called bins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just standard accounting practice thank you thank you very much okay the next uh question is in relation to the capital expense item items payment sweeper of 280 000. the question is how many squeakers does the town own and how many machine hours per year is recorded for each sweeper i 'd now ask um natalie adams our chief operations officer please thank you deputy mayor so the answer to the first question is the town has three sweepers and each sweeper for the second question does a minimum of 800 hours per year thank you i 'm on page 9 the capital expense items the library self-service system of 45 840 in this in addition to or sorry is this in addition to or a replacement of the existing rfid that was purchased a few years ago uh i 'd now ask natalie martin would our chief community uh through the chair that project was carried forward from the previous budget and was installed in the 21-22 financial year so that 's a new ice item not a replacement or an addition and just a follow-on question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in staff costs with natalie martin good uh through the chair uh not necessarily so uh manual handling and sorting activity so you can imagine uh the returning and sorting of books still needs to be done by staff we 're hoping that there will be some efficiencies in that uh and also you can uh there 'll be uh you can imagine staff tasks that have previously been undertaken through not having the rfid so scanning the books out that will be that that staffing will now be redirected to other processes so you mentioned the library is not just about books it 's about events uh it 's about training and so those staff hours will be directed to those type of stuff um activities thank you miss mum good okay that will be the end of our questions moving on to statement time our first statement is from mr mike gool from east victoria park and it reads as follows although traffic calming measures were last undertaken in 2017 as a local resident over over 10 years these have limited success in encouraging drivers to limit their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years three venues pizza kevans and sheesh have commenced trading until 3 a.m this has dramatically changed the traffic dynamics of the area with an increase in pedestrian motor vehicle for example uber food and pickups and delivery vehicles also late night prune and anti-social behaviour is prevalent daytime activities now include three very popular cafe outlets attracting mothers with prams dog walkers and elderly residents without a safe road crossing system a painted medium strip is ancient technology and is frequently ignored by motorists this area will only become busier with a planned child care centre and the future development of edward miller park i implore you not to become blindsided by past actions painted 40 per hour signs on the road surface are ineffective this is a dynamic section of albany highway and demands and requires smart solutions which could be achieved with low cost and disruption okay and our second statement is from neil teo from dynamic planning and developments and that 's in relation to 12.2 it reads as follows we dynamic planning and development pt by ltd act as the applicant for item 12.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a development application at lost 99-101 number 84-88 goodwood parade herein referred to as the subject site we are providing this written letter to the town 's elected members in lieu of us providing a verbal deputation relating to item 12. 12.2 by way of efficiently and ease in this virtual and covert 19 affected landscape the nature of this letter is to note our full support for the proposed development application and the officers positive recommendation for an exemption extension to the existing temporary approval of the tavern and brewery land uses at the site until the 1st of july 2033. whilst we acknowledge there will be no determination made at the 1st of march agenda briefing forum we kindly request that councillors support the officer 's recommendation at the ordinary council meeting scheduled for the 15th of march 2022 we consider the proposed extension of time for the approved use will allow the immediate locality to significantly benefit from the extended social and community activation that currently occurs at the site as a successful transitional use currently the town 's intended vision for the site being large-scale residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant evidence or interest from developers to suggest this will happen in the near future the existing approval tavern and brewery use users assist in revitalizing an aging industrial neighborhood to a vibrant and eclectic urban village to facilitate activity connections and public life into our future mixed-use neighborhood okay that brings us to the end of our statements we have no presentations this evening and we have no deputations okay so moving on to item 10 method of dealing with agenda business so questions have been raised by elected members on the following items 12.3 metronet management and maintenance of public spaces draft position for position statement 12.4 draft local planning strategy consultation outcomes and recommendation modifications 12.5 higgins park tennis club application 12.3 delegation for the ceo with a three being garden organic system procurement award we also have a question from 12.1 the burswood south streetscape improvement concept plan in the final stage and 12.2 uh 84-88 woodward parade east victoria park amendment to the development approval extension of time i 'd like to now ask elected members were there any other questions from other items otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the silence means no so that 's a good thing okay all right so we will then move to item 12.1 under the chief community planner reports the burswood south streetscape improvement concept plan the final plan and i believe i have a question from councillor wilford hendricks councillor hendrick thank you deputy mayor anderson um yes i have in this one as the community has raised concerns about traffic and it seems to be quite an ongoing issue with this area and in the final sort of um the officer 's report they this it mentions um the next stage and it says it can include an expanded traffic investigation and the next one actually says if we go ahead with this the next step is to carry out further traffic assessment i was just wondering what the difference is between a further traffic assessment or an expanded traffic investigation thank you councillor hendricks i would now address that question to the chief community planner natalie martin good please uh through the chair uh thanks for the question um i would consider an investigation um the same so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments about traffic so the next phase would be an analysis and an investigation um to address those traffic concerns so i would see them as one of the same okay thank you any other questions councilman hendricks before we move on right thank you all right we 'll move on to report item 12.2 84-88 goodwood parade east victoria park amendment to development approval the extension of time i have a question from councillor hendrix please thank you deputy mayor anderson yeah the first ones to do with the title that actually says this victorian park i think that 's a misprinting that should save buzzword um can that be fixed for the next uh the ocean number one hey yes councillor hendrix i 'm sure that can be fixed i could direct the question to the chief community planner mr natalie martinwood uh through the chairs yes it would be very easy to fix thanks yes there was another one i had mentioned again in the office report one of the most important considerations is that there 's no residential development that has yet occurred i was wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quite a large development very close uh chief community planner natalie martin group if you 're able to respond to that through the chair if i can uh refer that to the manager of development services mr crookshank please oh yes please mr cook shane if you could respond uh yes thanks madam deputy mayor the uh the statement i think councillor hendrix is referring to is at page 42 and just to provide a i guess a bit of clarity around that it does say that no residential development has yet occurred in the close to immediate proximity to subject site so yes there has been the crest apartments which has occurred um this is talking about close to media so i guess that 's probably more in terms of almost immediately adjoining or directly adjoining um is in that context that statements made thank you does that answer your question yep thank you moving on to item 12.3 the metronet management and maintenance of public spaces draft physician statement i have a question listed on councillor deborah thanks deputy mayor anderson i just uh wanted to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in both the attachment and the report a reference to securing uh in this item 12.3 agreement for leasable spaces to help activate the precincts around stations and fund the care and maintenance for open and community space i wanted to know or ask um how assured are we that this would be agreed to and are there other successful examples of the pta or the government allowing it around other station precincts successfully thanks thank you i 'll refer that question to our chief community planner natalie martin good please uh through the chair uh there 's no level of assurance that this would be agreed to however metronet staff have indicated that they 're certainly open to considering that they 've not given any assurances yet in terms of other examples uh not been away aware of any examples where the pta has agreed to leaseable space within the rail corridor i am aware of some examples over east but not in wa thanks very much thank you for your response with any other questions counselor deborah before i move on no thanks uh deputy mayor anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like to ask a question yes um definitely i have got a question on this one it 's um to do with the um local planning strategy the station preset plans it mentions in the in the i think in the strategic plan that the uh at kl station the station precinct plan is no longer necessary and yet in the report itself it 's on a couple occasions one in the letter from the ceo to to the thing it actually mentions that they want funding and said the state government should contribute an additional 200 000 funding um to fund the carlyle or the precinct planning for the carlisle and ocean oak street station i 'll also have another part there um the same thing this is in the analysis point number 13 funding for the precinct or station precinct structure requesting state government contributes again money for the carlisle and oak street stations i was wondering if the klr1 should actually be in that because because it 's no longer relevant according to the strategic plan or just some clarification on that that seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit more succinct just so i understand you 're asking because you dropped out a little bit for me so you 're asking about the carlisle station just before i direct the question to the community planner well it says that the local planning strategy and scheme review has revealed that the station precinct plan at carlos station is unnecessary and yet in the in the report it says we 're going to be wanting funding for the kellogg precinct station plan so i can 't see if it 's not necessary why we have to wait listed there to get funding for it okay all right i will ask the chief community planner natalie martin good if she 's able to respond to that question thanks uh through the chair happy to look at both the local planning strategy recommendation and this recommendation for metronet to make sure that they 're aligned so um we 'll we 'll we 'll undertake to do that and provide some further comment in the report to ocn okay thank you that 's always after uh thank you for your response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry deputy anderson i thought i didn 't have an additional question but um thinking about the response did make me reflect on one um because i think the response was that there aren 't any other stations with leasable spaces um and i was just reflecting on places like perth station that seemed to have shops within the station um that i thought maybe of a similar category but um perhaps i 'm uh incorrect in that but can i just clarify that if it seems that uh there are none in in perth thanks just to clarify is your question around whether we will be having the same type of opportunities shots is that one so yes the the report talks about um negotiations with metronet for leasable spaces which it means there would be a way to help cover costs for the open space and other things happening in that area which is great but also to activate precincts and i and i was trying to think of other possible examples um and i wondered if perth station would be uh an example of that um or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question the chief community and natalie martin good would you able to respond to that through the chair yes that is a good point i hadn 't thought of that and my ceo has just reminded me that that is the case so uh council is everywhere you are correct okay thanks and thank you thank you for your response all right is there any other questions counselor deborah i 'll ask you to drop your hand down please oh yeah sorry that 's right thank you okay moving on to item uh 12.4 the draft local planning strategy consultation outcomes and recommendation modification i have a question from councillor denver um my question was given i understand there were only seven submissions submitted on the vic park fia would it be feasible to retain this to allow future consideration of greater urban density in this zone which is particularly strategic for the proximity to the train station and albany highway strip thank you i 'll refer that question to our chief community planner i 'm natalie martin uh through the chair uh staff aren 't recommending uh that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning reform across a range of areas the removal of that multiple dwelling restrictions future investigation area would be considered in future years when the local planning strategy is scheduled for its next review when you look when you think about that area 's ability to accommodate infill there 's actually a very small number of properties that can actually have multiple drawings there 's been an assessment there 's actually only 14 properties that potentially uh could have in the field we 've looked at ones that are already developed we 've looked at vacant properties so of those 14 properties that could potentially be developed that the likelihood of all 14 of those being developed is probably quite slim as well but for that reason we 've not recommended that way thanks very much thank you [Music] okay so i will move on to the next report which is 12.5 higgins park tennis club clnp application i have a question from councillor deborah thanks sorry i 'm struggling to juggle my screens um by uh i see in the this item 12.5 that the lights being sought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i wonder whether the strategic alignment or elsewhere in the offices report could include reference to the positive synergy with our climate emergency and environment plans to make this more explicit and recognized as an added rationale for the application and ideally to encourage others to consider something similar thank you i 'll now refer the question to our chief community planner natalie martin through the chair very happy to include additional information about that we 'll include that in the further comment section that 'll be in the report to ocn many thanks thank you um okay we 'll now move on to our chief operation officer reports and we have a question on 13.33 the delegation for ceo for the three bin garden organic system procurement award i have a question from councillor deborah 's um i am excited about the move to a garden organic bin uh particularly as a precursor to fogo i see reference in the report on 13 point fee three to drawing on other council 's experience but no direct detailed reference to that can the bin change also be considered an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll now direct that question to my chief operations officer natalie adams please thank you deputy mayor the short answer is yes but if you could please direct the question also to the manager of technical services he could add something to that thank you thank you and i invited the manager of technical services to respond please um yeah i now invite mr john wong to respond manager of technical services he is available i 'm sorry no matter jay um yeah i was not able to unlock myself just now uh yeah so uh we do uh have the uh uh education waste education program for example which we are rolling out now um in conjunction with the uh preparation uh for the euro out roll out of the three bin system and also we have other initiatives such as the garage sale trail basically to further remind people about ways to reduce waste being being sent to landfill thank you thank you for your response do you have any other questions yes i do deputy mayor anderson i have a couple more questions if that 's okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be less waste and if so what consideration and evidence was weighed up and seen from other councils experience to keep the current 240 liter capacity red bin rather than opt for a smaller red bin given on the face of it there may be less waste total with the geo bin and that will be decreased further with fogo thanks i 'll start directing the question to our chief operations officer natalie adams thank you deputy mayor and may i request that you direct this to the manager of technical services uh thank you i 'll direct the question to john long technical services please thank you man so overall overall there is an expected reduction in waste that will be collected and basically after the road out of the garden organics beans and in future after the rolled out of the fogo or food organic and garden organic beans definitely after extraction of organic from our general waste bins we are expecting a reduction in the amount of waste collected in those in the general waste bins so the factors that we 've uh considered when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 140 liter smaller size bin included the following so excessive contamination was one of the major concerns as we 've discussed with our colleagues in other local governments when there is a lack of space uh in the general waste bins whether it 's the red lip bin or the dark green lip then uh there 's the potential for some household uh how to place uh general ways or contaminants which are not garden organics into the lime green bean which is meant for garden organics there 's also um the concern about uh once we have a high rate of contamination in the gutted organic spin there is a potential for penalty to be applied and that would be a liability for the town the other factors include the requirement for for inspection or been audit is actually quite expensive if we rely on some sort of enforcement to ensure that people are not just simply dumping contaminants or non-organic materials into the garden organic spins it is actually quite a costly exercise the other benefit of i 'm looking at the benefits now when we have similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cost effective for the town to undertake repairs or maintenance of those bins and lastly in terms of the verge space that would be taken up by the 140 liter smaller size bin uh as opposed to the 240 liter the standard size beam there 's not much difference in the area on the verge that 's required yeah i hope i 've answered the question thank you thank you mr wong are there any other questions cut for demo uh yes i do have a follow-up question um would it be possible to uh for residents to opt in for the smaller 140 litre red bin in place of the larger bin and if so would there be incentives um suggested for residents to do that i 'll direct that question to our chief operations officer natalie adams please thank you deputy mayor yes um residents can still opt in for the 140 later bread bin in place of what we 're proposing as the standard 240 litre bin in terms of any incentives we are happy to look at that and see what we can do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions um just one final question um can you also share further detail about the information from other council 's experience and include in that any information about why as i understand it the councils at coburn and vincent have both opted for a smaller red bin and what would be factors for us to weigh up in considering that yeah i think that we could have that information there 's like further information sent to elected members as opposed to probably being responded to this evening would you be happy with that counselor deborah ah yes yes i imagine it 'd be quite like um would you be comfortable with that um to our chief operations officer adams yes deputy mayor i would thank you we have any other questions before we move to the next item last night okay all right so report 13.4 full body part dates i have a question listed from councillor corey thank you deputy mayor anderson i just wanted to ask um noting the recommendations being that council do not approve the installation of any self-locking or time-controlled gates at this time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from residents seeking the reinstatement of the basketball backboards at kulbati park when can the these residents expect the further noise testing and corresponding consideration towards the potential return of basketball in the park to occur thank you councillor kenny i 'll direct that question to our chief operations officer natalie adams please thank you deputy mayor um so councillor chromey there are probably two parts to that so the first is that the town is actually looking at a review of the design that was undertaken with the consultant and the second is the noise testing that still needs to be done and we 've set the parameters and scope that up so we 're expecting that to be done by june this year and i 'd probably be just guessing if i was to say what we could do after that because after that those results we need to look at what we could do and how we would mitigate those um the noise so we would at the best be providing a further report back to council members not necessarily back to council through this formal forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames and the intended actions from that point thank you for your response are there any other questions counseling for me uh no not at this time thank you councillor sandra i see you have your hand done would you like to ask a question yes thank you deputy meg anderson yes um just following on from um council creamy 's question and the responses um there was mention of noise testing in june would that be with basketball hoops attached to those courts or without basketball who are backboards sorry um chief operations officer natalie adams please thank you through the chair the testing will be undertaken by june that 's our intent and it will be with the backboards reinstated and the hoops so be simulated as per a normal game and we would be testing the length of the court and the full court thank you thank you i have without any follow-up questions after counsellors down uh i next on my list i have counsellor deborah would you like to ask a question thanks deputy mayor anderson um i just wanted to ask if there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people that are currently or formally playing there could also access and how the access to other close courts compares with other parts of the town in terms of number of facilities available to people who want to play basketball thank you i 'll direct that question to our chief operation officer natalie adams please thank you deputy mayor so through the chair there are other basketball courts in the vicinity and signage has been prepared to state that and and assist with that and that will be installed at the kulbati courts to help direct users to other facilities in the town and with regards to access to those other facilities i think we will take that and look at that and provide that information in the further considerations thank you thanks thanks very much thank you for your response councillor heimer do you have a question please yes i do thank you deputy mayor anderson it was in relation to the uh sound measures is double glazing for the effective residence an option that could be looked at i will direct that question to our chief operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound measures sound mitigation measures sorry such as double glazing are one of the options that can be looked at but we do need some accurate testing results undertaken in the correct testing conditions to be able to make those recommendations thank you thank you for your response are there any other questions before we move on from elected members okay thank you all right moving on to 15 [Music] committee reports we have none we have nil 16 noted no motion of which previous notice has been given we have none 17 questions from members without notice on general manners do i have any questions from members on that as without notice please my questions uh moving on to our confidential matters 18.1 we have the ceo mid-year performance review report for 2021 2022 um and we will need to move behind closed doors um and so i would be requesting that um everyone needs to leave except for elected minutes connected members the minute taker i 'm anthony and desmond bray so if at this stage um i will declare the meeting close to the public as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything at this stage it 's a briefing forum and i would thank everyone for participating um and i actually see there was a hand up i just missed that from our governance officer brianna hi debbie i think yeah thank you sorry i just wanted to say if elected members don 't have any questions on that item there is no need to go behind close you can just close the meeting if there is no questions and all elected members can leave but if elected members have any questions then yes we can stop the live stream and move behind closed doors okay ah thank you miss brown a bit do i have any questions from elective members

and officially i would like to welcome everyone back for our first ordinary council meeting for 2022 although it 's fair to say that we didn 't plan to be in a virtual meeting room for tonight 's meeting the community transmission of coronavirus that occurred in wa during january and the ongoing uncertainty as case numbers began to increase resulted in me exercising the power in the local government administration regulations on 27 january 2022 to determine that this meeting should be held online having regard to the public health emergency that continues to be in force in wa my decision was made having regard to the need to ensure the safety and well-being of all elected members town staff and the public and an online meeting was the most inclusive method of achieving that objective now on an entirely separate note tonight will be the last council meeting of the town 's chief financial officer michael cole who leaves us at the end of february to take up a position in another local government mr cole was appointed cfo in june 2019 and it is fair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft budget had already been prepared and amendments on budget night sought a reduction in

of council i 'd like to formally thank mr cole for his enthusiasm and contributions to the financial management of the town his advice to council over the years and his participation as an executive leader in the town his sense of humor will no doubt long remain in our memories not to mention his knowledge of valves we do wish him every success in all of his future endeavors so thank you very

approved leave absence we have none item four is declarations of interest i 'll now inquire from our chief financial officer mr valletta if we have any declarations of interest please uh yes madam mayor we have uh one from councillor jesse heimer uh for item 11.3 it 's impartiality interest uh and item 12.2 councillor peter deveraux impartiality interest item 12.9 uh councillor peter deveraux impartiality interest uh item 12.9 deputy mayor claire anderson impartiality interest item 12.9 councillor broadway knife impartiality interest item 12.9 councillor jasmine karimi impartiality interest item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impartiality interest item 12.9 councillor wilfred hendricks impartiality interest and item 13.1 uh councillor luanna lisandro impartiality interest thank you mr ceo elected members uh if there are any of you who have any declarations of interest that you have not already made known can you please ensure that you bring that to my attention before the item on the agenda comes up for debate and decision uh are there any undeclared declarations of interest at this stage that any elected members wish to make known uh councillor sandro yes thank you mayor vernon i wish to add uh impartiality to item 12.2 hearing what after you 've declared your impartiality interest so it is in relation to the left lane park management plan would you be able to articulate again please your the basis here in reality yes thank you mayor vernon um i have an impartiality perceived could be seen as a perceived impartiality conflicts of interest as i 'd live within close to the development thank you thank you council alessandro as i say if any other elected members do have a declaration of interest that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please use your electronic hand signal otherwise we will be moving on the council 's agenda so we now move on to item five which is public question time so a number of questions were submitted by members of the community and they are presented now in the order in which they 've been received so the first public questions are from melanie lund of victoria park the first question is as our empowered and politically connected local elected representatives why is council unwilling to form an advocacy position to the state government on behalf of the victoria park residents whom they serve who are losing jobs homes careers mental well-being educational opportunities businesses and lives as a result of state imposed covert mandates so given that this is the question that 's directed to council itself i will answer it at this stage i don 't necessarily accept part of the premise in the question that we are a politically connected group of local elected representatives but they may very well be elected members on council who have connections with political parties um but in relation to the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh the question of an advocacy position to the state government is an item on the agenda tonight 11.3 and at this stage no decision has been made by council on what if any advocacy position they will take in relation to the subject matter of the petition which does relate to state government public health directions otherwise known as vaccine mandates the second question is given that the west australian newspaper perth now has already reported the outcome of the council 's decision on this petition how can the residents of victoria park have any faith that their councillors will follow due process and evaluate the petition on its merits i will answer this question firstly i 'm not familiar with any newspaper article either the west australian newspapers perth now or otherwise that has reported to claim that our council has already made a decision uh in relation to the petition um that is in item 11.3 of our agenda tonight there certainly was a newspaper article in perth now on the 3rd of february which reported that the town 's council meeting agenda contained a recommendation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should address the subject matter of the petition and that matter is on the agenda for item 11.3 tonight as yet no decision has been made by this council as to whether it will accept the officer 's recommendation or whether it will take a different view so that is the answer to those two questions submitted by melanie lund the next questions are two questions from bill razz of east victoria park the first question is how many businesses has council spoken to regarding the difficulties in implementing these mandates and secondly why has council misrepresented the content of the petition which was to form an advocacy position to the premier rather than stop mandates i 'll direct that question to the manager of governance and strategy ms barna brayanovic thank you the response to question one is that the town didn 't speak to businesses regarding the difficulties in implementing mandates imposed by the state government in relation to the restrictions and the answer to the second question is that the petition request hasn 't been misrepresented as the petition requested that the premier takes community concerns into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people the town has recommended that the petition be forwarded to the department of the premier and cabinet as the town is not the responsible authority thank you thank you ms briannovic next questions that we received are from ron grant of east fremantle i 'll read out the three questions the first question has the council done their due diligence risk assessment on the covert vaccine as a measure of stopping transmission of the virus if so what is the effectiveness in stopping transmission going to direct that question to the manager of governance ms branovic ah thank you um local governments are not responsible for carrying out assessments on the quoted vaccine as a measure of stopping transmission of the thank you thank you the next question from mr grant does the council understand their duty as a p c b u under the federal workplace law requiring them to provide a safe workplace direct that question to the manager of governance the town has to follow the directions from the state government in relation to any coivd-19 restrictions thank you the next and final question from mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any state law under section 109 of the australian constitution direct that question to the manager of governance thank you our same response as for the previous question and that is that the town has to follow directions from the state government in relation to any crevice 19 restrictions thank you thank you the next question submitted is a question from dale mcmillan of east victoria park the question does contain somewhat of a statement however i will need to read the whole of the question including the statements so it can be understood it appears that the council has misunderstood the intent of this petition i am calling on my local councillors to advocate for the residents and business owners of the town of victoria park to our state government public health orders that exclude people of a certain class or status and discriminatory and the public health case for such measures is weak many other jurisdictions around australia in the world have chosen not to adopt such measures town residents and businesses are being harmed by these public health measures and it is council 's responsibility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in this instance i 'll answer that question for mr mcmillan um the question of whether the council will take an advocacy position uh on behalf of residents and business owners of the town of victoria park as per the petition is the subject of item 11.3 on tonight 's agenda as yet the council hasn 't made any decision and it would be entirely inappropriate of me to answer this question before there 's been an opportunity for councillors to debate the item uh the next questions um there 's a series of questions um and they are somewhat lengthy so we 'll let everyone know there is some nine questions um and they are from sue cole trainer of black lane i 'm going to ask these questions one by one and ask the town staff to answer them individually so that they can be more readily understood rather than asking for answers at the end so the first question from miss coltrane what are the size meaning diameter height weight and construction materials for the proposed telecommunication poles and can the town please provide a visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief operations officer ms adams uh unless she indicates she insures mr denham to answer ms adams thank you mayor vernon so telstra have advised the dimensions of the proposed structure and they 've confirmed that they have the full current antenna and equipment loading requirements for all carriers with consideration for future loadings so we have provided by an earlier email a picture of that a visual example and just for clarity the type is a 30 metre steel pole the bottom diameter is approximately two meters and the top diameter is approximately 1.5 metres the weight information is unavailable at this time thank you thank you mr adams the next question is please explain for each of the below if the town has investigated these as options for the telecommunication polls and please explain if so why are they not considered as possible scenarios if not can the town explore each option and provide a report back to council and the options are roof of the new ticketing entrance building on lachlan park roof of the lathlan community centre on lakhland place roof of the toilet block at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so direct that question to ms adams thank you madame so the short answer is that the town has investigated each of those options that was stated for the telecommunication polls specifically for the first one the group of the new ticketing entrance building on left lane park the roof of the ticketing entrance building is actually lower than the height of grandstand and that does not allow for the same level of service coverage to be provided the next part was the roof of the left lane community centre on left lane on laplane place so the lapland community centre is located close to a neighbouring school and was deemed to be inappropriate c was about the roof of the toilet block at kulbati park kobani park is located close to a neighboring child care facility and that was deemed not to be um appropriate either the existing light poles on left lane park so the existing light poles within the west coast eagles lease area they were assessed and they were deemed not to be feasible as the installations of telecommunications infrastructure would actually impact the maintenance regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power that supplies the towers is also at its capacity so any additional power needs will require an upgrade of infrastructure thank you thank you ms adams the next question for miss coltrane what are the legal considerations if the leases are terminated early has legal advice been sought and provided direct that question to ms adams thank you man legal advice has been sought by the town so the telstra at least does not expire in 2030 june 2024 and the vodafone lease doesn 't expire until the 30th of june 2025 the leases cannot be surrendered prior to the least expiring dates unless each lessee agrees if the town seeks to terminate any of these leases prior to the least expired date without all seas agreement then the town be liable for damages and may also be required by court order to perform its obligations under each class thank you ms adams the next question is are there any legal obligations or responsibilities for the town to provide telecommunication polls on lachlan park as legal advice being sort direct that question again to ms adams thank you mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was legal advice sort but there are no obligations for the town to provide telecommunication polls of that land part however in order to negotiate and secure agreement from vodafone and telstra to early surrender their leases is necessary to provide alternative sites for both telstra and vodafone that are acceptable to them thank you thank you the next question is the town 's report on pages six to seven indicates that if the new shared telecommunication facility is located on the replacement grandstand building then vodafone and telstra become stakeholders in the building design and may impose criteria for the building how was this determined is this based on legal advice direct that question to the chief operations officer thank you very much please um redirect that to mr dunham yes certainly um request uh our manager of property and leasing mr denham to address that question thank you madam mayor um so we have obtained legal advice and in order to negotiate and secure agreements uh from vodafone telstra to an early surrender of their leases it as a matter of negotiation will be necessary to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be acceptable to them if the replacement grandstand building were to be such an alternative site it would have to be of a design that that is acceptable to them and their design requirements for replacement telecommunication facilities so it 's a matter of negotiation thank you thank you mr denham the next question is have the west coast eagles been approached as a possible option to use existing building infrastructure to house the telecommunications polls direct that question to ms adams thank you madame we confirm that the west coast eagles have been approached as a possible solution um and they 've completed their assessment of the land they consider for their telecommunications infrastructure um so they consider that the the tokyo telecommunications infrastructure will adversely impact foreign function and layout facility thank you thank you ms adams i had a little difficulty hearing the last of what you had to say and others may have been the same but i heard you to say that the west coast eagles had done an assessment of their building infrastructure and had determined that there were no locations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an adverse impact on the operations of the west coast eagles our next question is how has visual impact on amenity been assessed by the town without adequate detail on the design and construction of the telecommunications polls direct that question to chief operations officer ms adams thank you madam mayor the visual impact and amenity will be assessed as part of the detailed development application and at this stage limited information is available on the impact the visual impact so this is the montage is an undertaking for comparison purposes on on-site inspection um stadium which currently accommodates a 30-meter monopole thank you ms adams um the next question is how many trees will need to be removed to make space for the poles if scenario four is pursued that question to ms adams again thank you no trees are expected to be removed to accommodate scenario four thank you thank you and the final question from ms kiltrona why has the community not been consulted on this matter by which i understand his controller miss coltrana is referring to the surrender of the leases which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you madame it 's probably more a question of timing so the community will be consulted during the disposition of property process pursuant to section 3.58 of the local government act should the council resolve to proceed as well through the public consultation for the development application process thank you uh thank you ms adams uh that concludes the questions uh submitted by ms ms coltroner and we have uh two further questions that have been submitted so these questions are submitted by rhonda potter of carlyle the first question is at what stage of the negotiation and development approval will the community in particular local residents and business owners be asked for input and feedback direct that question to ms adams unless that 's a question you wish the manager of development services to answer thank you madame i 'll take that question um it 's similar to the last question so the community will be consulted during disposition of the property process pursuant to section 3.58 the local government act as well as through the development application process thank you thank you ms adams and the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with telstra and vodafone relocating back onto the new building on completion direct leases between each carrier and town could i have some more information about why this is not a preferred option by the town staff direct that question to ms adams thank you madame so scenario three is not preferred for the reasons provided in the report under item 10 in analysis and generally temporary cells where the telecommunications equipment is attached to a trailer they 're limited and they 're used for situations not standing beyond usually a six-month term to allow for limited levels of service coverage thank you thank you ms adams that concludes the questions from members of the public that was submitted in accordance with the town 's requirements for this electronic meeting we now have a number of statements that have been submitted by members of the community and i am going to proceed to read those statements out so for elected members these won 't be displayed on the screen you won 't be able to see them so you do have a fair bit of listening to do um i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement is from darren tetley of burswood this is a statement in support of the application for development approval number 45 for circus burswood proposed additions alterations to single house he writes as the builder i 'm writing in support of the owner karen bowen 's application for development approval of the above mentioned property firstly i would like to address the only public objection submission and would note that my client intentionally engaged a design architect herve kelly that was part of original design team for the circus birzman precinct project now self-employed at kelly design and drafting services herve kelly is fully conscious and well briefed on design aspects streetscape aesthetics and the need to meet or enhance the immediate streetscape facade this addition alteration proposal makes little or minor adjustments to both street elevations all color selections will be matched to the existing structure and landscaping will be designed to enhance and embellish the existing streetscape a final noteworthy point is that this proposed move to home-based workplace is in step with the need to reduce vehicle travel and coincides with my client 's choice to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fact i would suggest this addition alteration proposal is a positive move towards reducing traffic flow within the precinct and i would encourage the city to unanimously support the application the next statement is from amy cole of east victoria park and amy state i am a full vaccinated resident who does her best to shop and dine on and around the strip to stimulate the local economy and support my neighbours i was incredibly disappointed to see that local town run assets were recently given exemptions to some of the mandate requirements uh proof of vaccine and aqualife for example so that they can continue to trade and prosper unhindered by reduction in traffic due to the mandates meanwhile our local businesses are suffering from reduced turnover and the burden of having to police the mandates not only do i vehemently disagree with the mandate but i feel that this disparity is a slap in the face of local business that was already struggling to recover after the impact of 2020. as the world begins to open up and mandates including vaccine passports are being dropped in countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in france we are imposing extra social restrictions on west australians i urge the council to consider the financial and emotional impact of the mandates and to present the petition to the premier 's office in the words of margaret mead never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it 's the only thing that ever has the next statement is from lj mcmillan east victoria park your agenda item is written misconstrues the petition request the petition does not request the petition be forwarded but requests are let to be sent from town of victoria park to the state government a request to represent town of victoria park residents and businesses who pay rates for council salaries and facilities the other erroneous aspect is assuming it represents just uninjected there are a significant proportion amongst the injected who also do not wish to be showing their health information or just plain and simply do not agree with the show your pastor 's mentality if you have to show documentation to go anywhere you are not free the continuing changing covered landscape means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the state government to note the change globally when their dates on the public are being withdrawn and they need to do the same as wa4 behind economically and socially if you actually speak to town of victoria park businesses you 'd hear how the government requirements are an imposition on them additional labor costs when they already lay the shortages and increase in pay rates the daily unpleasantness of segregation and discrimination not to mention the mental load and stress of whether they 've done as required and could get fined anyway and to top it off patronage and income has reduced for many their workday or their business is not enjoyable anymore for all customers it is certainly less enjoyable and we have reduced our visits our outings sorry and eliminated some businesses all together from our visits namely those who make the process unnecessarily excessive our exercise and coffee group is injected and reject the mandate so this correspondence is actually from six of us your risk analysis included in the agenda item 11.3 suggests no future in financial impact this is impacting businesses and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and victoria park not to discriminate as segregated current facilities to which all ratepayers have contributed the state government are not requiring the local councils to exclude so why would you choose the nasty option how about continue to uphold the value of diversity and all welcome see your own promotions about the town attached with the values circle which are negated by this deplorable discrimination it is purely political and not about health as attested by the many things and venues which admit injected only and yet has still become hot spots high transmission locations superspreader events stand out step forward and be a leading local council among state and nationwide councils set the example of doing the right thing be a leading light in the darkness across the country are you going to uphold the declared values in the town of victoria park free your businesses and free your residence to enjoy all amenities and community freely if you have to show documentation to go anywhere you are not free the next statement is when sue called trona in lath lane in relation to item 13.1 she states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing council-owned infrastructure within the current vicinity of the existing telco polls opportunities to use existing infrastructure allows for minimising visual impact some possibilities that need to be explored include the roof of the new ticketing entrance building on lachlan park ruth laflin community centre and rather than place roof of toilet block at colbardi park the existing light poles on lachlan park which were funded by government through a grant to the town to name a few further i think the town 's administration need to provide evidence of what existing infrastructure could house in the utelco polls the information provided by the town 's administration is lacking in detail around the size diameter weight and construction materials to make an adequate assessment of what could be considered alternative sites the outcome of not providing a substitute telco poll has not been adequately canvassed and explained in the report there are telco polls on privately owned land whose responsibility is it to find carriers to suitable location even if the town had reached the end of the lease it is not clear as to the obligation thereafter to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information in the report in relation to the polls is height which is 30 meters no further details or visual images have been provided it would appear with the proposed location the trees need to be removed the town 's recommendation is to pursue scenario four two separate poles directly between each carrier in the town on page nine the report indicates the scenario deemed bible by both telstra and vodafone scenario four however i would like to draw your attention to telstra 's response to scenario four and in the image at the end of this email building two separate polls for both carriers would be far less efficient and economical outcome for all parties involved this will result in duplicate cost land space and community angst multiple polls will result in increased visual impact on the new precinct does not achieve council 's objectives in single pole build increased visual impact on the new precinct community pushback expected it is hard to understand why this option is being recommended it is not the best outcome nor has there been any community consultation marin councillors i respectfully request scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you request the towns administration undertakes further exploration of options in around or outside of black lane park as well as undertake community consultation ultimately the community is pretty much unaware of this proposal taking 75 square meters may seem like nothing however i do not believe the visual impact on amenity is acceptable nor any loss of trees the next statement is from rhonda potter of carlisle in relation to item 13.1 she writes as a business owner on rafale place and a local resident i have concerns around two of the suggested sites for these telephone towers on the corners of goddard and mccartney present and roberts road mccartney present is the road that takes you directly to lifelong place a bustling hub of business and community activity i think that placing these polls that are unsightly no matter what you do with them in either of these locations will detract from the aesthetic of these areas we do not want to be driving around robert 's road over our beautiful landscaping our blue tree and see them a fenced off area with telephone pole and electrical boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into beautifying this area it will be such a shame to undo some of this by installing these here not to mention that the corner of robertson mccartney has become quite a bird sanctuary these installations will upset an impact on the environment of this area the same applies to the other proposed site from the corner of mccartney and goddard this is an area that has had a lot of money spent on it to encourage our community to use it who wants to sit and have a picnic or skate or gather right next to telephone poles and electrical boxes with this in mind i urge you to reconsider these sites and please i ask the elected members to talk to their community about their feelings on this issue that concludes the uh public statements for public statement time so uh we will now proceed on the next part of our agenda which is now item seven which is the confirmation of minutes and receipt of notes from the gender briefing forum so elected members um you need to now be in a position to access your electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will be proceeding with voting this evening both for moving and seconding as well as for the purposes of voting so the recommendation is that council one confirms the minutes of the ordinary council meeting held 14 december 2021 2 receives the notes of the agenda briefing forum held 1 february 2022 3 receives the notes of the access and inclusion advisory group meeting held 6 december 2021 4 receives the notes of the madeira advisory group meeting held eight december 2021 and five receives the notes of the lath lane park advisory group meeting held 19 january 2022. can i have a mover and a second applies for the recommendation moved councillor ife and seconded councillor karimi uh is there any dissent from elected members and i will encourage you uh if you have descent you can both use your electronic hand but you can also interject and use your voice um by turning the microphone off mute and let me know if you think i 'm not getting the message quickly enough so there being no indication of descent to this item i declare it carried unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes from external bodies the recommendation is that council receives the minutes of the metro inner south joint development assessment panel meeting held on 23 november 2021 second receives the minutes of the west australian local government association state council meeting held on 1 december 2021 2 receives the minutes of tamala park regional council meeting held on 9 december 2021 and four receives the minutes of mindari regional council meeting held on 16 december 2021. can i call for a

item is number nine which is presentations 9.1 is petitions we have none 9.2 presentations we have none and 9.3 is deputations and we have none now move to item 10 on the agenda which is the method of

report 11.2 quarterly reporting february 2022 11.4 local government reform submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retention item 13.2 girder up bushland universal access item 13.3 review of land asset

report can i call now please for a mover and a seconder for this item moved deputy mayor anderson seconded councillor potter is there any dissent there being no dissent i declare that carried unanimously we now move to item 11 which is the chief executive officer reports items 11.1 and 2 have been dealt with by exception resolution so we now move to item 11.3 which is the petition of electors restrictions for unvaccinated people the recommendation is that council requests the chief executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premier and cabinet as the content of the petition does not fall under the remit of local government noting that no action is requested in relation to the petition and secondly advise the lead petitioner of council 's resolution can i call for a mover and a secondary counselor if you wish to be heard ahead of the officer recommendation before a mover and secondary sort thank you mev and yes i do i have an alternate um motion that i 'd like to have have considered prior to us considering the officer 's recommendation please uh thank you councillor ife um i will invite you to outline uh your alternate motion that you wish to have tested before the officer 's recommendation before you do that i am seeing an indication that councillor heyner has his hand up do you wish to ask a question counselor homer sorry thanks man i just trying to unmute um am i able to also mention i have an authentic motion or have to wait till after uh no councillor homer you 're not at this stage uh councillor ice has indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put to counsel before the officer 's recommendation is put what that means is she now has the floor to present her alternate motion if her alternate motion is subsequently resolved by council in favor of her alternate motion uh that will be the end of the matter the officer 's recommendation will not be put and there won 't be any other alternatives that will be put forward because her alternative motion will have been determined by council if however a councillor is alternate motion is not supported by council and it is lost then uh certainly another elected member who wishes to put forward a different alternate motion or to seek to put forward the officer 's recommendation i would call on them at that point in time but that 's the process in accordance with the meeting procedures local law so once an elected member indicates they have an alternate that they wish to move that needs to be dealt with i am aware for the purposes of those who are joining us and listening tonight on live streaming that a number of elected members proposed alternates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three such alternates and the meeting procedures local law does not contain any specific provision as to how to determine the order in which alternate motions are to be decided upon in accordance with regulation 110 subsection 1 of the meeting procedures local law if there is no specific provision in the meeting procedures local law uh a determination is made by the presiding member as to how to proceed so in this instance i have determined that the appropriate way to proceed when there are three alternate motions to one item on the agenda is to hear those alternates in the order in which they were submitted by elected members and the first alternate motion was submitted by councillor if to me and to the town 's chief executive officer on the 4th of february this year and subsequent alternate motions were submitted last week and yesterday so on that basis council ice alternate motion was submitted first and that is the determination that i 've made of the order in which we will deal with them so having made that determination counselor life if you would now like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till it comes up on the screen before we move to the reasons thank you will do my alternate motion is that council one takes no further action on the matters raised in this petition and two request the chief executive officer to advise the lead petitioner of the council 's resolution and i see that 's up there so i 'll give my reason my reason is that this petition relates to issues that are outside of the control of the town of victoria park thank you councillor i i can now seek a secondar for the recommendation uh councillor arf your alternate motion has been seconded by myself mayor vernon now invite you to speak to your alternate motion thank you may vernon i won 't say too much i may say more at the end of debate unfortunately vaccinations and mandates have become a point of disputing conflict across australia and the world recently while i do understand that some people have chosen not to take up the opportunity for a vaccination and that their choice has been has impacted what they are able to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an issue for local government petitioners should consider raising these concerns directly with the state government seeking local government buying to advocate on these issues only drives further conflict and unease taking no further action on this petition does not prevent business owners who disagree from expressing their frustrations at the mandates but we also have business owners who support the mandates too and only 22 signatures does not tell us that there is support for a new advocacy position on the council 's part at this stage this does not have a place in local government so i say let 's not buy into this any further thank you thank you councillor i um as the second of your alternate notion i 'll also speak relatively briefly um my decision in this matter is informed by the role of local government i agree with the content of the office 's report in answer to the petition that the imposition of public health directions which many people in our community now refer to as vaccination mandates is entirely a matter for the state government of western australia they are responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a health perspective they are also responsible for making decisions to reconsider public health directions that they have imposed or chosen to issue for the benefit of the community the role of local government is to provide services to our community and the role of council and council laws is to provide for the good government of the town not to provide government that conflicts with the government provided by the state of western australia our role is also to oversee the allocation of the town 's resources and to oversee its performance of the functions of the town it is my view that no part of the role of local government is to assess the medical efficacy of covert 19 vaccines nor is it the role of local government to go out and conduct risk assessments and to ascertain the extent to which business owners are experiencing difficulties as a result of state government imposed mandates there has been in the petition reference to the town 's corporate values of inclusion and caring those are values to which the town holds dear they were set by a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they remain the measure by which our behaviours are set however it does not mean that we are not being inclusive and we are not being caring if a decision is made not to take any action on this petition which is exactly what the alternate motion says the reality is that those people who have been trying to convey to the state government their opposition to vaccine mandates have turned their attention to local government on the assumption that elected representatives on local councils exist in order to advocate for their community to the state government of western australia that is not true as a general proposition our role is to advocate to the state government or things that the town of victoria park needs in order to discharge its functions and in this regard no attempts in my view to link the town 's corporate values to the subject matter of this petition would move the subject matter of this petition into the jurisdiction of local government it is rightly a matter to be raised with the state government of western australia there is a formal mechanism by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of western australia and have their petition presented in parliament where these very laws are discussed and debated on a regular basis the person who is elected to represent the interests of the electors of the town of victoria park in relation to government public health directions is hannah beasley the member for victoria park and i encourage those people who continue to have concerns about the impact of vaccination mandates on their daily life and their businesses to contact ms beasley to seek her support to put up a petition to ask her to present it on their behalf and that is the appropriate mechanism in which this matter should be dealt with so for all those reasons that 's why i 'm prepared to endorse the alternate motion i do so because i do not consider the officer 's recommendation is the appropriate one for us simply to forward a petition that was never addressed to the state government in the first place but was addressed to this council asking us to do something it wouldn 't be appropriate to simply send that through to the state government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fellow elected members to think carefully about the role that we perform on council if we could listen to every single thing that our community brings to us and advocate on their behalf to other levels of government we would no doubt be engaged 100 of the time in doing that however that isn 't the purpose that we serve the purpose that we serve is governed by our strategic community plan and by the corporate business plan and work of the town of victoria park in relation to our own district and not to vaccine mandates that apply to the wider population in the state of western australia um so there having been two speakers now the mover and the second are in favor of the alternate motion can they now call us there any elected members to speak against the alternate motion counselor homer thank you matt vernon yes i would like to speak against the motion um but i could could i also foreshadow that i have an alternative if this motion does not get up you may do that in the course of you speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes thank you um i know the role of account slate is to represent the interest of electors rate payers residents of the district and facilitate communication between the community and the council knowing this is our role taking no action on this petition petition is a missed opportunity i will be supporting this petition as i know the difficulties the town is having interpreting and implementing the current restrictions our local businesses are also doing it tough and what many are calling a shadow lockdown the town leads the way and does so much more than just garbage collection and maintenance as mentioned in the offices report i look forward to hearing some positive constructive suggestions and discussing with council around how the town can offer support to those businesses and community members that will be affected either by restrictions or having to enforce them also to add the suggestion to get a petition from the state government by hannah beasley having met with her personally i know that is not an optioner she will not be supporting any position of that context uh thank you councillor hamer did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice alternate motion is not successful because you indicated at the outset that you 'd like to do that you do need to do that formally for us now yes if i may thank you maybe my alternative motion if the this motion is not successful is that cancel one takes consideration and the concerns and or impact of introducing restrictions for the unvaccinated people on the local business community when item number 12.5 future of the business advisory group from the ocm 14th of december 2021 is referred to council for final determination at a later date two advise the lead petitioner that no request can be currently made to the premier as the concerns have not been outlined specifically three council will look at implementing any best practices learned from other local governments to support the community and business while we have community transmission and restrictions thanks councillor homer um is there any elected member who now wishes to speak in favor of the alternate motion no um if there 's nobody else who wishes to speak in favor is there anyone else who wishes to speak against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mayor vernon um i then echo the uh sentiments of uh councillor homer there but i 've also got to add and we as a local government are the nearest um form of government to our community and when they reach out to us i think we have an obligation um to to listen to them and yeah for that reason i would i 'll be supporting the petition that might be supporting this motion thank you thanks councillor hendrix i 'll call again is that anyone else who wishes to speak in favor of the alternate motion before i call upon councillor deveraux who 's indicated he wishes to speak against no counselor deborah thanks may vernon and thanks to those that have spoken so far on this important issue i just wanted to raise my concern about the polarization um that issues around covert are causing in our community and on that basis i when i looked at the officer 's recommendation i felt that was quite prudent in the sense of taking on board and listening to the community sharing that with the department of primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the community needs to be heard um even if uh any of us take a different position i also um feel like the impacts of covert are very broad for many people for everyone and we need to as a council try and respond to that as the best we can to everyone and so in that sense i don 't support a proposal for singling out just about the mandates i think it 's more important to look at the impacts of covert on the broadness of the community and the range of different groups that are severely affected by it and business owners are one group in that category but there are a number of other groups that are severely impacted as well as the broader community and i feel like that 's where our emphasis should be and in my view for the council in the future it will be useful to look at examples of resilient communities around the world that found ways to tackle this issue in a way that looks at all of the impacts on all different groups and brings the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supporting this motion thanks thanks councillor devereaux um councillor sandro could you indicate you 're wishing to speak for or against the motion i have a further question thank you uh yes thank you please proceed with your question thank you very much um i just want to just ask at the abf was indicated and asked a question if we were to adopt the officer 's recommendation that the item would not be seen as endorsing the petition but merely just presenting the petition to the state government and just for that 's one question and um the other question is for clarity the petition when it was presented to council in december of 2021 my understanding is what it was addressed to the premier and was that the case thank you thanks councillor sandro direct your questions to the manager of governance and strategy ms branovic uh through the chair uh yeah this is just to afford the petition to the department of primary and cabinet and it is not asking for any further action to be taken and sorry can you repeat your question council alessandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was um as i wasn 't present i was absent at the december ocm when i went to listen to the live recordings my understanding is that the petition was addressed to the premier it wasn 't addressed to the state government so i 'm just wanting clarity that it was addressed to the premier thank you uh ms bryanovich and i think councillor um losandro when you say addressed to the premier the petition is addressed to the mayor of the town of victoria park the content of the petition as in what the petitions have asked petitioners have asked for is that where you 're referring to the content of the petition refers to the premier versus the state of western australia is that what you 're trying to clarify uh yes thank you the content of the petition thank you uh thank you miss brayanovic to the chair uh the petition was addressed to the mayor but the actual petition request states that council receives the petition requesting the premier takes community concerns into account and reconsiders any decision to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i could reserve my right to speak on the item thank you i 'd like to possibly speak after councillor potter thank you uh yes councillor sandra you can however i don 't know if councillor potter is indicating that she wishes to speak by raising a hand or whether she 's got a question because i have asked twice already for councillors who wish to speak in the usual order um and um i was trying to follow the meeting procedures rules where we inquire of those who wish to speak for and then those who wish to speak against and there being no other persons who 'd indicated they wish to speak for um we went to against um but i 'll go to councillor potter and we 'll find out but council alessandro if you do wish to speak when we reach the last of the elected members who haven 't spoken so far and before i invite council life to close the debate you will need to let me know if you wish to exercise your right to speak then otherwise the debate may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak because i intend to support this motion and i thought that both uh councillor if and yourself have pretty much made the arguments that i would make so i was going to just stay quiet but given the um the arguments that i 've been hearing against the motion i decided to just address a couple of the things that i heard in those arguments and that was that our businesses in the town are doing it tough and that this would show support for those businesses i actually think that the town has already shown support for businesses doing it tough through covert uh i don 't think we have given up showing support for the businesses in our town doing it tough through covert uh and i expect that as um as the community spread becomes greater and infiltrates our town more that we will act um in in a similar manner to the matter we have acted in in the past in that you know we um have done things like promote promoting our local businesses but also supporting with with business grants which came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic started um i i think that um to say that the support for this petition is about supporting our local business um is is uh short-sighted and i think that there are other ways and greater ways in which we can do that um and i i will be supporting the motion the this the motion that 's on the table for the reasons that have been given by both yourself and council life thank you councillor potter um in accordance with our meeting procedures i will now ask is there anyone who wishes to speak against the alternate motion council alessandro yes thank you mayor burnham after hearing the um debate from the elected members i will not be supporting the alternate motion and the reason being is that i do believe that the officer 's recommendation is appropriate that it be forwarded on to the state government i do um take um some you know i do understand that we have supported um local businesses um with covered recovery packages in in the past and and i believe that we 'll have to continue doing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you know i guess once this virus gone um but the reality is that it 's that it 's here um by um not supporting this alternate it 's not that i 'm not against um vaccination um i believe that vaccination is important i understand that um there 's arguments that the vaccine mandate is a state government issue and i do believe that um as councillor deborah has stated i think that closing off the door and um not kind of providing this petition via the office 's recommendation to the state government would be seen as um kind of not listening and we do have to take into account um varying views so on that basis that i am comfortable with the original officer 's recommendation i will not be supporting this alternate motion thank you thanks council alessandro deputy mayor anderson thank you man vernon i will be supporting this alternative um and i 'll be supporting it because it really is it 's short and sweet and to the point um i think it 's really important in this instance which is impacting many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we actually address that this is actually dealt with at a state government level it is much more significant and it 's bigger than what it is that we are able to do at this time um so the actual officer 's recommendation to send this petition through um and if we did that it 's not in the format that the state government would receive so it would end up filed under probably rubbish so it wouldn 't be heard and at this instance as a local government councillor there are other options and other strategies that we can do and we can hear that our businesses are struggling as well as our community and our vulnerable community are struggling and those in our aged care facilities those out in our age of age population and people with disabilities in our community are also feeling very isolated and very much alone through this time so we can actually utilize our opportunities in front of us to go through our business advisory group and we 've done this previously when we were struggling through covert before with grants as councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important that we take a positive stand on what we can do with our strategies and at that strategic level but in this instance with 22 signatures on this petition i cannot support it but i will be supporting this alternative thank you thank you uh councillor anderson um since we only have one other elected member who hasn 't spoken um if you wish to let me know that you should speak now really is the time because i will shortly be closing the debate and going back to council of eye so councillor kareemi would you wish to be heard thank you mayor vanna i was feeling left out so i thought i probably shouldn 't speak um look i i have listened to everybody 's um uh sort of points of view and taken in the debate and i thank you all for the um you know the sharing of all your views i personally will be supporting the alternate motion on the basis of the points that counselor life uh raised when she first spoke and you know outlining her reason also on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not in our remit as local government elected members um and then um following on from what deputy mayor anderson just said the the petition is currently not in the correct format to be forwarded on to the department of premier and cabinet and it is on that basis that i i you know i 'm happy to support this alternate furthermore i also echo the comments that um we are i believe doing a good job listening to our community i have spoken myself as i know other elected members have too many local businesses to many members of the community we 're all involved in community groups be they sporting clubs or regulars at cafes and local businesses and the majority of the people that i have spoken to do not feel like this is something that local government should be involving itself in and so on that basis i will be supporting the alternate thank you thank you councillor karimi so i 'll now go back to councillor ife as the mover of this alternate uh do you wish to close the debate i do thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no further action on this petition does not indicate a lack of care for the concerns of people in our community it actually takes into account the fact that there are that many many varied views of people in our community many varied views i 've had as many conversations from people supporting their dates as i have with people opposing mandates um and so taking a position on this isn 't especially helpful we don 't have a position from our community yet it 's also worth mentioning that covert has had broad community impacts well beyond vaccination mandates and it feels to me that the conversation has recently turned into vaccination mandates being anything impacting people 's lives um when in reality covet is still continuing to have a massive impact on people 's lives regardless of vaccination mandates in fact you could argue that thanks to vaccination mandates we 're not currently in an actual lockdown and so there is less of an impact on people 's lives than we 're experiencing in lockdown last year so i think that when we talk about um the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination mandates we need to think about as councilor anderson mentioned people who are feeling vulnerable and lonely people who are at great risk of contracting covert and becoming very very ill from it um and so the conversation needs to be much broader than whether or not mandates are a reasonable thing um it 's also worth knowing that a lot of the conversations i 've been hearing are about feelings people don 't feel like they want to be vaccinated people don 't feel like mandates are there science doesn 't have room for feelings um it doesn 't have room for beliefs and there 's many times science tells us things we don 't like science tells me that i shouldn 't drive my car everywhere i should walk or ride my bike instead some days that 's tiring but it 's science can 't argue with it all of those things exist all of those things are true um but above all regardless of all the other things that we 've said this is simply not an issue for local government this is an issue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i spend money at our businesses i listen to our business owners but they have varied voices and we need to realize that thank you thank you councillor i uh so now inquire um well not inquire but ask all elected members to please cast your vote uh in relation to the alternate motion so i 'll declare the alternate motion carried those in favor myself man vernon deputy mayor anderson councillor kareemi councillor potter and councillor ife those against councillor sandro councillor deborah keplerhamer and councillor hendricks thank you elected members for your considered debate on this topic it certainly has been one that has inspired various different views as council i 've said and varying different degrees of responses from members of our community but the petition was presented we did accept it we 've had a report from offices and now we 've had a debate as to the way forward for this council and so the matter has been concluded but again um everyone 's voice has been heard tonight so we appreciate all the contributions that you all made to this debate um now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief executive officers reports given that item 11.4 has been passed by exception resolution we would ordinarily now move on to item 12 which is the chief community planner reports however i am noting that time is 7 53 p.m so elected members have now been sitting for almost one and a half hours and i have determined that with online meetings it is appropriate that we have a rest break um at the one and a half hour mark rather than proceeding to say the two hour mark which we would normally do if we were in person and for those who are curious about that change of approach it is because when we are in person individual elected members are able to get up and leave their seat in the chamber um if they need to take a short rest break whereas when we are all online it will be much more difficult for individuals to do that and it is better that we all proceed to do that at the same time as each other so um given that it 's now about to be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next number of items which are all planning matters that do require our attention and debate i 'm now going to move a procedural motion that we adjourn for 10 minutes and we resume it will actually be at 805 pm can i call please for a second up for my motion that we 've been journeyed um for 10 minutes seconded counsellor i thank you is there any dissent from elected members uh there being no dissent declare that carried thank you elected members if you could please remember to stop your video whilst you 're away so you don 't see what activities go on in the background at your homes and for those on live streaming we will be back shortly thank you it 's 7 55 pm we 're journeyed for 10 minutes okay [Music] okay everyone uh well it 's now 805 pm and we 're ready to resume i 'm getting an indication that we 're now live with our recording but noting that we still don 't have deputy mayor anderson back in the room as yet acetate i can where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you i was about to ask our manager of governance to please alert me and let me know when she 's back in but in any event we 're back now so we will pick up where we left off we 're now moving on to item 12.1 which is the local heritage list and the recommendation is that council advertises the draft local heritage list at attachment 2 and the draft local planning policy 43 heritage list at attachment 3 for a minimum period of 30 days and in accordance with the requirements of deemed clauses 4 and 8 of the planning and development local planning schemes regulations 2015. can i please have a mover and a secondary for this item still seeking a move up i moved myself may vernon seconded councillor hamer before i speak on this item i do wish to move an amendment uh to the item and i did circulate my amendment to elected members and the ceo um quite late this afternoon but hopefully governance will be in a position to display my proposed amendment on the screen so my proposed amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council one advertises the draft local heritage list at attachment 2 in the draft local planning policy 43 heritage list at attachment 3 for a minimum period of 30 days and in accordance with the requirements of deemed causes four and eight at the planning and development local planning scheme regulations 2015 two requests the chief executive office to assess the girder up bushland precinct as a new nomination for inclusion in the heritage list and three request the chief executive officer to investigate as part of the consultation on the draft heritage list referred to in point one above whether the following properties should be reconsidered for inclusion into the management categories listed below a 105 berwick street victoria park to management category 1 b burswood canal to management category 1 c kent street senior high school to management category 1 d victoria park hotel and belmoral hotel to management category 2 and e the somerset street pool to management category 2. i see that that is currently being displayed on the screen um so now proceed with my reason and this amendment reflects the responses from the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agenda report on this item following questions that i raised at the agenda briefing forum this amendment will ensure clear direction that these properties are the focus of the further investigation and allow for any necessary investigations into the potential re-categorization of the named properties to occur during the public consultation process that should assist when the results of the public consultation come back to council for final decision could i call please for a seconder for my proposed amendment seconded counselor vicky potter um i 'll just speak really briefly i was pleased when i read the local heritage list that it reflected in large measure our local heritage inventory that was approved by council previously now called the local heritage survey and what concerned me was the common tree was sufficient to suggest that each of the properties that are proposed in the amendment uh were i think capable of reconsideration as to whether they belonged in the lower category that they were currently sitting in so in the cases of burwick street birds of canal and kent street was sitting at management category 2 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category 1 and in the case of victoria park hotel of belmoral hotel and somerset street pool all three of those reasonably iconic destinations slash places within the town and i felt that they could uh do better if they were elevated to management category two rather than remaining management category 3 which would have seen them not end up in the heritage list my amendment is not to conclusively determine that we should put any of these properties into the higher management category or indeed into the heritage list but to make sure that there 's an investigation as to whether or not a rethink is required and it appears from the town office 's responses to my questions now in the agenda report that even the consultants consider this possible re-categorization is worth consideration um so i just want us to have the appropriate options to know that um all of our important heritage places have got their place in the sun potentially in our future heritage list so uh councillor potter as a seconder did you wish to be heard no thank you i 'm good thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed amendment to this item i 'm not seeing any descent so on that basis i will declare the amendment carried unanimously thank you so we now go back to the substantive item um as the mover i don 't wish to speak and be heard on it further um councillor hayner as the seconder of the substantive item do you wish to be heard all right thank you mayor vernon no nothing for me thank you uh so i 'll formally call is there any dissent uh to the substantive recommendation as amended not seeing any indication of any dissent from elected members so i declare that item carried unanimously thank you we 'll now move on to item 12.2 which is review of the lachlan park management plan and the recommendation is that council receives the report on the review of the left lane park management plan can i call please for a mover and a seconder for the recommendation so moved councillor devereaux seconded councillor hamer councillor devereaux did you wish to speak to the item thank you councillor as the seconder do you wish to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um [Music] is there any elected member who wishes to speak against the item uh i would like to just ask a couple of quick questions if i may um before calling uh to indicate if anyone has any descent to the item so in the in brief summary uh where it refers to a desktop review having been undertaken um which identified a number of matters that required attention and it is recommended that a consultant be appointed to progress with stakeholder engagement community consultation and the preparation of an amended lp mp my question is um first and foremost over what period of time um would that work be done by a consultant progressing with the all the steps necessary for the preparation of an amended lachlan park management plan i direct that question to mr crookshank the manager of development services i think you met him there so if the amen sorry if the motion is adopted tonight we 'll need to seek expressions of interest from appropriate consultants so i guess the time frame will be somewhat dependent upon the capacity of consultants to undertake the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably likely to extend into the the first half of the next financial year so or in other words maybe to explain that better i 'd like to think it 'd be wrapped up this calendar year uh thank you um i don 't have any further questions um so we 'll ask formally is there any dissent in relation to this matter um i 'm not seeing any indications of descent so there being no descent i declare that carried unanimously we 'll now move on to the next item which is 12.3 which is an application for development approval at 950 to 952 albany highway east victoria park development application for commercial building child care premises and educational establishment the recommendation is that council approved by absolute majority the application and plans dated 15 december 2021 submitted by taylor burrell barnett proprietary limited da reference 5.202 1.495.1 for proposed child care premises and educational establishment at number 950 and 952 being lots 559 and 560 albany highway east victoria park in accordance with the provisions of the town of victoria park town planning scheme number one and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in full on the recommendation at pages 52 to 55 of the ordinary council meeting agenda can i have a mover and a second of please for the officer 's recommendation okay moved councillor potter seconded deputy mayor anderson uh councillor potter did you wish to be heard no thank you uh deputy mayor anderson is the second did you wish to be heard no thank you vernon thank you is there any dissent councillor hendrix you either wish to indicate you have dissent or you 've got a question i 'll go to you yeah thank you mayor vernon um i have a question on this one um it 's to do um with access to the property um so next door with the tavern i think in the offices report they 've got a large expansive hard stand which i assume is that the car parking and for the tavern is is the um and that 's how people can access the terminus lane as a shortcut and i assume from hubert street as well does that belong to the tavern and the other thing too is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hard stand area from accessing terminus lane was my question uh thank you councillor hendricks um i 'll direct your question to mr corkshank the manager of development services thank you and councillor hendrix if i could ask you to meet your microphone please uh thank you madam mayor uh yes certainly at the moment there 's access i guess more direct access to the right of way that has access to the back of the site through the franklin 's car park so at the moment someone could potentially drive through the franklin 's car park from either albany highway or hubert street to get access to the right of way to then get access to the the car park at the back of this child care center however it certainly is within the rights of the land owner of the hubert sorry of the taverns franklin 's tavern to restrict people making that movement across their land the report does indicate that that could be the case if that were to be the case there 's still alternative access available to the right away from certainly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right away so even if the landowner wants to decide to restrict access across their private property there 's alternative means of access via the right-of-way thanks mr quickshank councillor hendrix any other questions no that was it i was just curious on that one thank you thank you uh so i 'll now ask um formally is there any descent to the officer 's recommendation there being no indication of dissent there being no dissent declare that carried unanimously thank you we 'll now move to the next item on the agenda which is item 12.4 which is the application for development approval at 14 to 16 mccartney crescent which is in latham the proposed additions and alterations to educational establishment the recommendation uh is that council approves by absolute majority the application for development approval da reference 5.2020.50414.1 submitted by slaven architects proprietary literature perth for additions alterations to educational establishment located at number 14 to 16 being lot 62 mccartney crescent laughlin in accordance with the provisions of the town of victoria park town planning scheme number one and the metropolitan region scheme subject to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74 to 75 of the ordinary council meeting agenda can i now call please for a mover and a seconder of the recommendation uh moved myself mayor vernon seconded councillor kareemi is there any dissent no there being no descent declare that carried unanimously thank you item 12.5 on the agenda is the application for development approval 888 albany highway east victoria park proposed new commercial building two restaurant premises the recommendation is that council approves the application for development approval da reference 5.202 1.430.1 submitted by yanxi investments pity limited or additions alterations for restaurant in accordance with the provisions of the town of victoria park town planning scheme number one and the metropolitan region scheme subject to the conditions which are set out in full at pages 88 to 91 of the ordinary council meeting agenda can i have a mover and a second applies for the recommendation still seeking a moodle uh moved to councillor potter seconded councillor heyner um councillor potter did you wish to be heard i 'm not at this time thanks mayor vernon thank you councillor homer did you wish to be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um yeah i want to speak against this motion just on the parking spot fall which we went over in the abf and i wasn 't convinced with the reply of the capacity that the car park had to handle such extra parking thanks councillor haymark so having spoken against the item um now call for a speaker in favor of the item please councillor hendrix yes thank you there um i 'm not in favor of it but i just got a question um if i can ask first by all means proceed with your questions yep so parking shortfall 's a big issue here um i was just wondering if the town had any plans in the near future to [Music] put a covering on the sand or something westminster street which is quite a large area it could probably cater or create quite a few more parking bays i was just wondering if it 's that far down the track or is it going to happen soon thank you um oh i think i might have to direct that question to uh the chief operations officer ms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking facility in westminster street and if it 's not for you ms adams please indicate who would be in a position to answer that question thank you just one moment please sorry man vanden i 'm not in a position to answer that question at the moment um can you redirect that please to the chief executive officer uh yes um mr ceo uh through you madam mayor um the westminster stump has a plan to be decked at some point in time under the land asset optimization strategy and also the original integrated movement network strategy but it wasn 't just going to be a car park it 's looking at the potential development of the site so it 's a it 's a medium to long term objective to do something with that particular site okay thank you councillor of councillor hendrix rather is there anything any further questions the idea one did have one more question on this one um i see that there 's two restaurants um planned for it side by side and the one on the left there is basically one on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any toilet facilities is is that normal or can they get away with that scenario direct your question to the manager of development services mr crookshank i think you met amir i 'm just trying to locate the plan just to appreciate the question i can see that the premises on the left hand side does appear to have a toilet um there 's a on the note on the plan it refers to uat which i believe would be universal access toilet so from my viewing of the plans it would appear that both tenancies do have a toilet okay thank you that clears that one up thank you uh thank you councillor hendrix um if i could just get you in due course please remove your hand facility thank you um i had a couple of questions that i wanted to ask about this matter and i just want to be able to bring them up so i 've got a number of questions my first question is what number of bays make up the 10 to 20 remaining capacity in the hubert street car park during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the graph that was provided by the officers in their report mr crookshank is that a question you can answer please uh yes thank you madame um there are 144 parking bays plus four akrod parking bays in the hubert street car park so 10 to 10 10 to 20 of that represents around 15 to 30 parking bays being available thank you my next question is if we permit parking base shortfalls on the basis that public parking is available nearby but the town doesn 't take any steps to increase the capacity of say public parking how can council be satisfied with the objectives in local planning policy 23 to make adequate provision of parking for various services facilities and developments and to efficiently manage parking supply and demand are actually being met mr crookshank uh yes thank you again um in terms of determining the current application the officers are satisfied that there is adequate parking available to meet the demand particularly when you consider there 's an existing parking shortfall for the site however the point is understood that there may be a need for separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car parking to be provided for the precinct and this needs to be considered as part of a future parking review thank you um can i ask a question which i 'm sorry i haven 't given notice of this but with regards to your reference to a future parking review um we 've already had a presentation to council back in november of an agenda item for us to endorse a parking management plan that item was uh deferred off to a future concept forum for elected members um can i ask whether um mr cole 's chief financial officer or someone from ms martin goods team are able to answer the question of whether the parking review that mr cookshank just referred to in his answer is likely to be a part of the management parking the parking management plan or is it likely to be more be an assessment about town facilities that 's quite separate to the parking management plan i 'm just not sure who can answer that question through the chair i 'm happy to answer that question thanks mr cole the parking management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted by council yet um primarily sets out a matrix by which to consider parking issues and a certain level of trigger points within that the parking review that mr cook chain 's referring to i think is in relation to parking generally in that vicinity not not necessarily linked to the parking management plan thank you then in that case i go back to mr crookshank so in terms of uh your answer that the need for additional public car parking to be provided in this area would be considered as part of a future parking review can you advise elected members please which service area of town carry out that review for parking facilities uh yes madam mayor the the place planning team are intending upon taking the lead on that project and just to elaborate a little bit further my understanding is that parking review that i talk about is um it 's reviewing the applicable parking ratios that apply to all developments throughout the town which i think i 've indicated previously somewhat onerous compared to other local governments as well as identifying areas that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be provided and the work will also involve the preparation of what they call a cash and lieu payment plan a parking plan identifying those areas where the town may be able to consider accepting cash and loot payments thank you uh my next question is um with regards to council considering a waiver using the deemed for 77d of the planning regulations um can you summarize on what basis council can be satisfied that a waiver of the proposed parking bay should be granted by council mr crochet uh yes madame there 's a number of reasons that have been put forward in the report including the proximity to public car parking generally as well as the hubert street car park and the site 's access to public transport in addition beyond those matters outlined in clause 77 d2 of the regulations our report outlines other reasons for support i think one important consideration that maybe hasn 't been emphasized enough is the much improved streetscape outcome for albany highway that results from building a building right up to the street frontage as opposed to a large setback that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the planning regulations at a state level which could otherwise allow this premises to be used in the interim for an alternative purpose and then change to a restaurant without any consideration of car parking um in addition to that there 's also the comments made in the report about the relative and more contemporary car parking rates applied by other local governments which factor in the proximity to public transport and public parking thank you uh my next question following on from that is about our local planning policy 23 um when was that policy last reviewed by the town and council mr corkschenk uh yes madam mayor there has not been a comprehensive review of local planning policy 23 there 's been some minor amendments only that have been made and as i mentioned in my comments before it is intended subject to funding but a review of that local planning policy take place in the next financial year thank you with regards to the reference in the report to the capacity or otherwise for financial contributions to be made by developers for a parking shortfall could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking shortfall that council could consider imposing on this development under local planning policy 23. uh yes madame the town 's current fees and charges budget has a applicable rate of thirty thousand dollars per day for cash and low parking however the state government did introduce some new planning legislation in july of last year relating to parking generally and cash and lieu payments which has a alternative contribution rate that is to be applied immediately by all local governments so as to ensure some consistency and looking at that uh that formula that 's been provided it would seem that the contribution rate would now be in the order of around a maximum contribution of four thousand six hundred and twenty nine dollars per bay so based on the 19 bay shortfall or sorry the 19 bay additional shortfall proposed that would equate to around 87 88 000 thank you so based on that information on what basis should council be satisfied that such a financial contribution isn 't applicable to this development mr crookshank uh yes madam mayor um the changes to the planning legislation that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ july 2021 have out i 've introduced new provisions regarding cash and lieu payments there are transitional provisions that apply allowing local governments to continue to impose cash in lieu in certain circumstances however from the 1st july 2023 local governments can only impose a cash and blue requirement where a cash and blue parking plan has been prepared the transitional arrangements provide that until the first of july 2023 cash and lieu payments can still be imposed if there are interim parking provisions that apply that term interim parking provisions is defined in the regulations and it basically requires that the local government have a policy or a scheme provision that outlines where the provisions of the cash and loot payment might apply and the purposes for which the money will be used um while the town does have a local planning policy dealing with parking it includes reference to cash and loo that policy doesn 't identify the specific areas that the cash and loot payments would be appropriate or how that money would be spent so in my view the town would be unable to apply cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitional provisions that refer to in the regulations uh thank you mr cookshank i appreciate uh receiving from you those detailed answers that 's all the questions that i had um appreciating that i asked a number of questions um now go back to the resolution that has been moved and seconded is there any descent apart from obvious oh actually what am i saying is that i need to send councillor homer you 've already spoken against the matter um sorry that 's my fault um for forgetting that um is there any elected member who wishes to speak for or against this item because if not i should be putting it to the boat sorry councillor demero your hand has just appeared electronically did you wish to speak on the item or you 've got some questions uh just thanks me vernon i just have a question after um the answer that you received if i may just to pick up on the point um about the future parking review for the precinct um i just wondered given we are reviewing at the moment the new transport strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the focus would be not just on cars but all forms of active transport would that change the way uh this parking lack of parking provision is seen in the future direct that question to manager of development services mr crookshank madam mayor i 'm expecting as part of the parking review that what will what a likely outcome could be is a lesser parking standard to apply to developments throughout the town particularly taking into account um factors such as proximity to public transport and proximity to public parking it seems to be particularly the the contemporary way that a number of other local governments have dealt with parking in so far as they have a a base rate of car parking for developments and then depending upon depending upon those locational criteria and proximity to those things i just mentioned then there 's an adjustment factor where the car parking can be reduced so i would anticipate that that 's probably going to be a likely outcome is that there 'll be a lesser parking standard applying to develop in the town in the future thanks thanks councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you uh councillor haimer since you have already spoken on the item you can ask questions but that 's all thank you vernon i did have a question uh just from what was mentioned about the cash and lu provisions would it be possible to make provisions for the cash and new to go towards the decking of the sump or any other expansion or work to the hubert street car park direct that question to mr clock shank uh madam mayor as i indicated before is that to be able to accept a cash and loot payment there needs to be a plan adopted by council showing where the money is to be expended or where the money is to be allocated to which particular facility and how it will be used there 's no such plan in a local planning scheme or a planning policy at this time so my view would be no it 's not able to be imposed as part of this application but at a future time when the council has adopted such a parking plan then a contribution could be applied any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in assuming that we are not able to retrospectively back date any of those provisions if we did uh allow this shortfall in parking now mr crookshank madam mayor that 's correct can 't be done um thanks counselor homer um counselor lisandro yes i have a question um just in relation to obviously um the ceo mentioned that the westminster sub was a medium to long term asset and that it was looking for covering that and to use that for other possible other purposes as an asset land asset i 'm wanting to know if um and given that there are 144 bays in hubert street is there provision um of any further expansion or development of hubert street to provide extra parking thank you uh mr corkschenk are you able to assist with that question or is that one for someone else um madame someone else might be able to chip in maybe mr valletta i think it 's maybe been um contemplated uh some sort of works to the hubert street car part but i think it 's just a talk i don 't think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valetta maybe um i 'll refer that to the ceo here to add madame uh the same answer as before in regards to the westminster sump both hubert street and westminster are looked at being developed into something much more than what they currently are over time under the laos strategy their land optimisation strategy and because the parking or integrated movement network strategy in the past also related to the future needs of parking in certain locations that would be incorporated into any development that we would actually undertake on those sites thank you just further on is there a timeline for the hibit street car park site westminster is medium to long term is what 's the case for the hubert street car park uh mr ceo to the extent that you can give any idea of the timeline uh madame air will be the same it 's not in our long-term financial plan at this point in time so it goes beyond the extent of the long-term financial plan and i would class at a medium to long term thank you thanks council sandro so obviously we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there anyone who wishes to speak

network and otherwise the remainder of the recommendation which is lengthy appears on pages 143 and 144 of the ordinary council meeting agenda can i call now please for a mover and a seconder for the officer 's recommendation still seeking a second dog uh moved myself mayor vernon seconded councillor hendrix um i don 't wish to be heard in relation to this matter councillor hendrix do you wish to be heard no thank you vernon thank you um can i ask is there any dissent i see some hands up um can 't quite determine whose hand up electronically was first um so councillor potter and then councillor los alessandro thank you very much really just a question um because i 've got some concerns about the the proposed locations of these towers um the recommendation and i 've read it numerous times tried to get my head around it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief executive officer to provide a further report to the main 2020 ordinary council meeting to consider a telecommunication list on part of lot one on diagram two six seven one five with telstra corporation limited or it 's nominally and then part four is the same but the vote um is is that saying that is that that is the only location that we are considering at that point or will there be other other opportunities to consider other locations is kind of my first question and uh and then i may have other questions after that thanks councillor potter well i think we 'll we 'll go with your first question direct that question to the chief operations officer mr adams thank you madam mayor um as per my earlier answers other locations were considered but i will request that you refer these questions to the manager of property development leasing please thank you mr denham thank you madam mayor um the the recommendations do give some flexibility should um an alternative location sort of be identified obviously what the report is doing is it is seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council to an absolute position at this stage okay so um my second question is was consideration given particularly when looking at the site for the vodafone tower which is on the corner of roberts and can 't be i think um because that that um particular site was when we when when lifeline development was put together it 's actually remnant bushland so to me that is probably on that whole block is the most um fragile piece of land that we have uh so was there a consideration given to that the fact that that was a remnant bushland or was that not not sort of thought of mr denham do you want to answer that question uh thank you madam mayor um i am aware that the uh that the site was exhaustedly walked um uh with the telecommunication carriers and and and town officers thank you counselor potter something arising from that so many things arising from that um my can my concern so i 'm trying to actually figure out whether i want to move an amendment to this or whether i need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations do you have any any other questions at this point that we might be able to ask that could help you get there because i am noting that counselor sandro possibly has questions that she wants asked because i haven 't yet asked her um if she put her hand up because she wanted to speak substantially on the item or she wants to ask questions that could create an opportunity for you to have a bit more time to digest what you 've just heard um did you want me to go to council sandra to see if she 's got questions to be asked i think let kenneth 's little sandra ask whatever questions she may have and that will maybe spur on some more questions of my own or maybe an amendment not sure all right thank you council alessandro were you uh intending to ask questions or did you wish to uh substantially speak on the matter i 'm wanting to ask some questions so i can get some further clarification thank you yeah if we get started and i think the way forward if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them one at a time just bear with me i need to bring them up thank you all right um my first question is is the wapc the body that will make the final approval for the telecommunications leases if they are located in any part of laflin park thank you mr denema you content to answer um these questions going forward until the point where you advise me it 's for someone else uh yes madam matt my understanding is yes uh the wapc would be the decision-making body for a development application at lathlain park was there any consideration for uh alternate site to be located to adjacent to the proposed telstra location within the perth football club leased area thank you mr denham uh yes madam mayor that there were considerations given to such alternative sites um [Music] was there any consideration for external sites outside of laughlin park the yes madame external sites were considered and indeed scenario i think it 's scenario five uh provides some comments on that given the current office 's recommendation to negotiate scenario four being two separate polls in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation to allow for a report to come back to council to find alternate sites and if so would this item point number two need to be changed to reflect that thank you mr denham um thank you madam mayor um the the recommendation did does give some um some room for an alternative site to be to be identified and brought forward it doesn 't to my mind fix the council to uh specific locations um given that this goes back to the wapc um for final approvement approval is there consideration if um is there any state policy or federal policy that prohibits telecommunication communications stations from being located within schools child cares or kindergartens madam mayor perhaps that 's one that uh mr crookshank may be able to assist with uh mr crochet manager of development services are you able to assist us with the answer that question ah yes madam mayor there is a state planning policy that deals with telecommunications infrastructure and that will be used for the purposes of assessing a development application however i am not aware of that policy containing any provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uses that council los sandro mentioned thank you if a development application were to go ahead would it be lodged with the wapc prior to coming to council thank you i might ask mr cookshank to answer that question madam mayor as has been mentioned the wa planning commission would be the determining authority however the process would be that the application gets lodged with the town the town then has i think it 's 42 days to make comments or provide a recommendation to the wa planning commission um in making that recommendation will be some community consultation involved and obviously following following that a recommendation is then provided to the commission i certainly think given the the nature of this application it would be a matter that comes to a council meeting for a recommendation to the wa planning commission has an arborist report been done to assess impact on existing trees within zone two lifeline park in the proposed to least areas i 'm going to direct that question back now to the operations team uh mr denham is that one that you 're happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adams uh thank you mayor mayor i 'm i 'm happy to to answer to that i can confirm that no arborist report has been obtained at this stage however the telecommunication providers have certainly indicated a willingness to obtain that sort of expert advice should there be any impact on the trees has the noise impact assessment study been done on the two proposed separate locations for the telecommunication leases thank you mr denham madam mayor um however one could certainly be requested by the town thank you um i 'll leave it at that for now thank you let others ask questions thank you i may have further thanks councillor sandro councillor devereaux thanks may vernon um i i 've noticed that there has been a lot of questions from the community about this um both personally as well as um tonight in the meeting and i just wanted to pick up on one issue related to the two different places um as council potters alluded to when she spoke initially and just to ask is there potential to consider incorporation into town policy of a strong preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use benefits and minimize the impacts of the environment and the community thanks uh mr denham thank you madam mayor um yes uh um the next time the town 's leasing policy uh is uh is that for review we could certainly look at the council can certainly look at uh amending that policy uh in the way that is proposed as noted in the report there is already a planning policy which mitigates in favor of sharing telecommunication infrastructure on on one location thank you madame thank you council devereaux thanks that 's all for now uh thank you um are there any other questions at the moment from elected members and council deborah you still got your electronic hand raised um thank you um i have a question which um might be able to be answered by mr crookshank or potentially miss martin good i seem to have a recollection when we when council dealt with the telecommunications um poll that was cited in orong road uh in laflin um was to be constructed on a private property i think it was uh might have been an optus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it was in the last two years um was there um am i right in remembering that there were some legal cases that had gone to the state administrative tribunal where local governments had councils had refused planning permission for such towers and those refusals have been overturned by the state administrative tribunal i 'm happy for either of you to jump in if you recall what i 'm thinking of uh madame yes that was certainly referenced in that previous report for the development of wrong road um obviously there were some concerns from council about that particular proposal and um i guess the report provided a some commentary on some other state administrative tribunal decisions that um yes where councils had refused applications but ultimately the tribunal had upheld the um the application uh thank you because my memory said to me that at least one of those cases involved uh telecommunications tower near dog swamp shopping center and community objections which the council took on board were around the proximity of the tower to a primary school i think a child care etc and it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state administrative tribunal although i can 't now think of the reasons why i was thinking that might have been some assistance to councillor sandro from the previous question not sure mr crookshank if you recall any of that being the case i know madame air i can 't recall the specific details although all i could probably say is that my recollection was ultimately it was concluded that the visual amenity impact of those towers was acceptable but i i can 't remember the circumstances or any issues around proximity to schools or other uses thank you council sandro you 've raised your hand you have some more questions yes i do thank you mayor brennan additional questions um will the young trees currently planted in the proposed telstra site be relocated back into zone two lapham park should this proposal if this were proposal were to pass this motion and that site was to be chosen mr denham currently there 's eight i thank you madam chair uh yes um we can certainly arrange that noting that in this situation we would be the landlord and we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just through planning but also through uh through leasing covenants thank you madam chair thank you my additional question um given this is you 're trying to negotiate for a 20-year lease would they and is there provision for stating to the telecommunications company wherever it 's located that the if it is to be located within zone 2 laflin park that their lease would only be to 20 years there 'd be no further opportunity for any further extension mr denham uh thank you madam chair yes we we could uh provide for that uh in in the lease thank you would that have to be motioned as part of the motion uh mr denham um [Music] i 'm just looking at the recommendation and recommendation five does say uh under roman numeral one least length of up to 20 years so at this stage there is already that kind of parameter in place also um the the recommendation is uh is proposing that a further report be submitted to the may 2022 ocm on both the telstra and vodafone proposed leases so there would be a further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you thank you um if both telstra and vodafone were to co-locate onto the same infrastructure would they require a larger footprint for the telecommunications station and if so what would that be mr denham thank you madam mayor my understanding is that uh they would not require a larger footprint than what they are currently seeking thank you last question um i note that in the response the officer stated that to miss call triana 's um questions i think it may have been her questions in relation to there was consideration not to locate it at black lane place community building because of its proximity to not a desirable location because of its proximity to children i guess child care along those lines um [Music] is it and given that the there was comment from mayor vernon that the wa pc don 't take into consideration its proximity to schools child cares kindergartens etc on planning matters um why was it ruled out that you know i guess alternate locations on roofs is it mainly because of the height of the poles uh councillor sandro before i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't say that the wa planning commission doesn 't take into account things like proximity to schools etc and the like i was referring to decisions made by councils for development approval that had resulted in refusals of telecommunications towers those weren 't decisions made by the wa planning commission those were decisions made by the local council and they had been taken on appeal to the state administrative tribunal by the telcos that 's a different matter to this where this will be a decision of the wa planning commission so i didn 't purport to say that the wa planning commission wouldn 't have regard to things like proximity to child care schools etc um so so long as you 're directed and as long as you understand that i 'm happy for mr denham to answer the balance of your question yes thank you thank you madam mayor uh would it be possible for councillor cassandra to just repeat the balance of her question just so i can try and answer it as best as possible thank you certainly council sandra i guess what i 'm saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters it would appear that the wapc did not take into account um distances from schools child cares and kindergartens and is that the case thank you in that case i might direct that question to mr crookshank as manager of development services because i think that 's probably more up his alley than it is mr denims mr crookshank uh madam mayor i think the question was around do the wapc consider that that the wapc would be guided by their policy as i mentioned before my understanding is their state planning policy that they apply to telecommunication facilities doesn 't specifically make reference to the proximity to such uses whether they consider it or not i 'm not able to answer i 'm not aware of any wapc decisions on telecommunication towers and that being a particular consideration so the question before from the mayor were around decisions made by the state administrative tribunal on maybe applications of that kind mr crookshank just to clarify um with decisions of the wa planning commission to take up councillor sandro 's point seeking some clarification does the wa planning commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding land uses such as perhaps land use for primary schools child care etc madam mayor i would imagine that it probably would be one of a number of considerations that they look at yes thank you council alessandro i interrupted your questions like that thank you yes um another question is there an australian standard in relation to telecommunications stations and polls that require any distance for vegetation mr denim whether it be above ground or below ground i.e tree roots thank you mr denham thank you madam mayor um we are not aware of any uh any such australian standard thank you could a condition be placed on um a telecommunication uh within the lease to ensure minimal impact on vegetation mr denham thank you madam most certainly yes thank you and just lastly um as this recommendation um i 'm concerned as um is coltrana mentioned that it looks like we 're endorsing scenario four and taking on board councillor potter 's question about opening it up so that there could be possibility to look at other alternate scenarios how would that be achieved how could this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case and that a report would come back to council with various scenarios mr denham thank thank you madame i 'm perhaps a little unclear on on what the reference to various scenarios means is that referencing uh scenarios within the left lane excited the multiple multiple scenarios whether it 's within the black lane park site or outside of the left lane park site and also shared shared communications as stated as best planning i guess in terms of the state policy 502 which is in point eight of the report thank you mr denham mr denim my apologies madam mayor i put myself on mute sir uh if the matter were to go down the pathway uh proposed by uh council alexander then um amendments would be needed to this recommendation to to expand it in in whatever way was uh was was seen fit um by council uh i would make the point that the overriding feedback we got from telstra and vodafone is that they will not share facilities with one another for one reason or another and detailed analysis of that has been provided in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potter thank you i 'm now ready to move an amendment i 've been typing away crazily and i have sent it through to governance even though it 's from my work emails um so i 'd like to move an amendment to amend items three and four as follows three we request the chief executive officer to provide a further report to the may 2022 ordinary council meeting to consider alternative sites both on and off lane park the telecommunication lease with telstra corporation limited or its nominee including the site marked on part of lot 1 on diagram 26715 and four request the chief executive officer to provide a further report to the may 2022 ordinary council meeting to consider alternative sites both on and off latham park for telecommunication lease with vodafone network proprietary limited or its nominee including the site marked on part of lot one on diagram two six seven one five oh it 's there amazing miraculously if i can get you to outline your reason first because that would be important in seeking a second sure so my reasons for this are whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share a poll i accept that we are looking at scenario four in in that we were looking for two sites for two polls i 'm not convinced that the sites that have been marked on lot one of diagram two six seven one five are the most appropriate sites uh particularly um the site marked for vodafone zone which is remnant bushland which has been we 've been very careful to protect when we did the left lane precinct redevelopment so whilst i 'm happy to include those both of those sites for reference in uh in a report brought back to council um i would like to see other sites researched and presented that may be more appropriate uh thanks councillor potter um can i call please for a seconder for councillor potter 's amendment uh seconded counselor los sandro um councillor potter did you wish to speak substantively to your proposed amendment just really briefly to say i understand that these um that these telecommunication leases need to move i understand the importance of um having them move so that we can actually start work on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the last remaining thing standing i think both telstra and vodafone know how desperate we are for them to move so that we can do that piece of work um i 'm just not happy with the sites that have been presented and i want to make sure that we uh do everything in our power to find the most appropriate site for what we 're going to have to move with these telecommunications in order to do this piece of work uh thanks councillor potter um i now invite councillor sandro as the seconder um do you wish to be heard uh yes thank you mayor vernon i 'd like to reiterate um councillor potter 's comments um i think that it would be it 's in our best interest to try and investigate alternate sites um i understand um the in visual impacts i also am concerned that we have spent a significant amount of money within zone two to make that quite a beautiful location and i am concerned that having two separate towers in you know within literally you know 100 meters or so or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visual impact and also affect the remnant bushland as well as um being quite located the telstra site least proposed lease site being right next to a skate rink and basketball hoop so i think it would be prudent for council to investigate and have a report come back to council so that we can have a look at whether there are alternate sites even outside of blackline park that could be used for um a telecommunications tower thank you uh thanks councillor lesandro um i wonder if i could ask a couple of questions please of the administration um and miss adams i 'd be grateful if you could indicate to me that you would wish to answer this question so looking at the proposed amendments which would see a report come back to council in may noting that i think just checking the attachment thinking one of the attachments might have been 13.1.2 in assessing the carrier relocation scenario a complete relocation out of lachlan park was looked at or commented upon as scenario 5 and indicated that the process would typically take 24 months [Music] and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from elected members prior to this meeting so if we were to go ahead and do this amendment and in may the report is no more detailed than what we have at the moment which says external sites have been looked at and nothing has come up where does that leave us ms adams yourself or someone else that you want me to direct it to no thank you and i 'll take that question i think there 's a couple of considerations in there so one is about the distance from the existing infrastructure so i think it was from memory around 50 to 100 meters from existing so we are limited to where we can go um external um to left lane park and where where they and where the car is located now the the other point is um the may the request to bring a further report back in may so delaying the process can potentially delay the demolition or proposed demolition date for the grandstand because we have to bear in mind that at the moment the best information we have is that we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the grandstand can be demolished so the chant the the point is that the other alternative locations have been reviewed um and i can appreciate from the comments that they 're they 're not desirable um from both the the town 's recommendations and that the the ones proposed are not desirable to council um so we can certainly provide a report that details those alternative locations and alternative sites i think may is probably a little bit late um based on the current plan for demolition um but yeah we can do it and we can look we can address the concerns that have been brought up today but i 'm not sure that we 'd actually have anything further or substance for you to consider thank you um thank you miss adams um can i then ask as a follow-up question is there an alternative where we bring this matter to a concept forum at the end of february so in other words in probably less than 10 days time where you can present all the details of all the locations that you have considered for elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing a report to may council meeting wouldn 't actually advance the opportunity for elected members to decide this matter and your point is it could impact on a delay of the demolition of the grandstand for the zone one project i 'm trying to find something that will actually give us a bit more flexibility rather than locking into requiring a report to may council meeting so is there anything that you can suggest that you think might i guess accelerate this process over and above the current amendment which is being proposed by councillor potter thank you very much just give me one second trying to think some alternatives we can certainly bring it to concept forum but we do note that um you know we we did walk that side extensively with vodafone and telstra and they you know these were the the best sites that they came up with that would still provide the coverage that they needed um there is a bit of apparently a flat spot sometimes in in that lane there um so if i suppose the question is more for council if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the scenes is brought forward to a concept forum in february is that likely to provide some comfort to council for the perhaps you know potentially march post uh look thank you um i 'm probably going to go back to councillor potter first and then to councillor hamer because i just want to flag this for all elected members this is a separate matter it has now been more than an hour and a half since we had a break but there is an option potentially for suspension of the standing orders rule against speaking twice so we could have more of a free-flowing conversation not sure that that 's going to necessarily get us too much further which is why i want to go to council of potter first and she raised the amendment and i don 't want anyone to think that my questions were indicating i was against the amendment i want to actually know if the amendment 's going to be workable and get us what we want to get to because putting it off to may and then finding out where no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to whether or not they think this is an opportune moment for a break after we 've heard from council potter and everyone might be able to think about this or alternatively if people just want to keep pressing on be ready to answer that question when i ask it off you shortly and i 'll just be asking you to do your electronic thumbs up so councillor potter um questions from you uh yeah thank you melvin and i probably would like to take all those other options that you just gave um my question is around the so my question is about the report to the may council meeting um the reason that i put that in the um amendment was because the original report that items um three and four were to the may council meeting and when i asked the question about whether this was the only site that was an option or whether we could look at other sites um it was kind of indicated that we could look at other sites and that might be the time that that would happen so which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that amendment happy to change that to an um to a concept form if that 's what need be um but i guess my question is uh was it was it considered that these would be the two sites and that the may what would the bay report then be about um yeah uh thanks council potter i can say as i read um the office 's recommendation the bringing of it back to council in may was so that we would approve the leases to each of the telcos which means the site of their polls would have been determined like as in fixed um so bringing back a report about alternate sites would mean we wouldn 't potentially be in a position to grant the leases at that time but ms adams um is that right yes madame that 's correct so and just looking at that wording it is um you know if there is a refinement to do a concept form for a better understanding we would still be looking to have items three and four of the recommendation stand in that you know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything further counsellor potter not at this time i think i think i 'd like to spend steady orders yeah i understand that can i just ask councillor homer did you have some questions on this item because then i really want to quickly poll elected members about taking a break um and then potentially looking at suspending the standing orders because we do have i want to be able to formulate some options out of our conversations so council homer did you have some questions for the staff to answer i did actually i the endeavor to look for alternative um locations will is that likely to be fruitful being and that 's already been undertaken and walked at length and we 're just gonna be wasting time and are we sure there 's no possibility of the one paul option i mean it seems silly that telstra and vodafone share polls in many other locations is this just they know they 've got us over a barrel or is this something that happens often uh thanks both those questions i refer them to ms adams thank you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know definitely discussed and was was the first port of call but they were just in the end adamant that they would not share a poll essentially so because they haven 't we 've had to bring it to council so it would have made it a lot simpler if they they weren 't to your first point look the town believes that we have we 've spent a lot of time on this and i know this report looks relatively short but there 's been a lot of time and effort going into trying to find the best locations i 'm not sure really that you know at the end of this period of time we 'd come away with many different options to be honest so um like i said that the site has been extensively walked with both telecommunication carriers we have looked at um various sites we 're very limited in actually how far we can go from where the existing infrastructure is cited and fully appreciate that it 's you know not you know desirable locations but you know i think we are where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get any more counsellor thank you okay um thanks very much miss adams for that um so first and foremost for elected members we 're now boxing on to almost two hours since we had our last break so i am very keen to actually offer elected members a short break um can you indicate to me if you 're content that we would have a 10 minute break now um seeing [Music] yep probably getting enough hands at the moment i haven 't seen anything from deputy mayor or councillor hendricks or councillor sandro thank you um so i think uh that is uh relatively unanimous that we 've been moving that way so i 'll move that in a moment um second thing i have for you is is there a desire at this stage when we come back from the break because i want to do the break now that 'll give everyone a chance to clear their head is there a desire to consider suspending the standing orders when we come back um to have more of a free discussion or do people just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotion um okay so people using their electronic thumbs up doesn 't really help me because i gave you alternatives so i don 't know what you 're putting your thumbs up number one number one right suspension of the standing orders so there might be a bit of a discussion copy that all right well we 'll see how we go so i 'm now going to move um that we adjourn the meeting um at 9 48 p.m for 10 minutes um actually just we 'll just wind it up to 10 o 'clock just to make it even um and so

that so moved councillor potter seconded councillor sandro is there any dissent from elected members no there being no dissent to declare that carried unanimously thank you thanks everyone for your patience and listening and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give us some more options for what we will do next um now move on on our agenda to um next item um noting the items 13.2 13.3 13.4 13.5 13.6 uh have all been adopted by exception resolution item 14 is the chief financial officer reports and items 14.1 14.2 14.3 14.4 have all been adopted by exception resolution so we get to item 15 which is committee reports um and item 15.1 is the independent audit report an annual financial report for 2020 to 2021 and the recommendation is that council one receives the 20 20 21 audit completion report and independent orders report two notes the adverse trend of the asset sustainability ratio and the action being taken to monitor the ratio in the 2021-2022 financial year three notes the non-compliance matter of the super user access accounts and the action being taken to address the matter four accepts the annual report 2020 to 2021 and the annual financial statements the 2020-2021 financial year is attached and five holds the annual general electors meeting on tuesday 29 march 2022 commencing at 6 p.m in the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consideration of the annual report and other general business secret mover and a second are please for the officer 's recommendation uh so that item is moved counselor creamy and secondary counselor hendrix counselor creamy did you wish to be heard no councillor hendricks did you wish to be heard as the seconder no thank you you 've made it um thanks uh councillor hendrix um i do wish to move a small amendment to this item the amendment i wish to move is that 0.4 of the recommendation sorry 0.5 of the recommendation be amended to replace 6pm with 6 30 pm but the reason for doing that is to bring the start time of the annual general electors meeting into line with all our usual ordinary council meetings but i have a second appease for that proposed amendment seconded councillor vicki potter is there any dissent uh oh counselor lisandro you have your hand up do you have a a matter with this um a problem with the amendment or something else you 're still on mute counselor sandro sorry um i don 't have a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but i 'll wait for the amendment to pass and then i 'll ask my question thank you thank you um so is there any dissent in relation to the proposed amendment uh no just making sure i can see you all no uh there being no dissent declare the amendment carried unanimously thank you um council alessandro your question yes thank you mayor vernon um just in relation to point five and given the current situation with covert um is there provision for if the meeting were to be required is there provision for any potential for the annual lectures meeting to be held online and if so the subsequent question is would there be provision for the public to be able to participate to ask questions and move motions within the annual elector 's meeting online thank you um direct that question to the manager of governance and strategy ms banovic so that she i am not aware of a provision for that meeting to be held online it can only be held online when the minister allows for that meeting to be held online like um what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are planning to hold the meeting at the town if anything changes or if we get any new information regarding this meeting being able to be held online we will form inform elected members and the community and we will look into different options to potentially allow the community to be able to participate online thank you i should also say council sandro that it stands to reason that if we were in a position to hold an annual meeting of electors online but we could not secure an opportunity for those electors to participate in the meeting by voting and putting up motions then we wouldn 't be holding an annual meeting of electors because the act makes clear that the annual meeting of electors is the opportunity for electors to move their motions um so if we couldn 't give them such an opportunity we wouldn 't actually be able to hold the meeting at all so we would have to do that um but as miss branovich says um at this point it doesn 't appear like uh that option is in the legislation so we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the officer 's comments if that 's the case would there is there any provision within the powers of the minister to allow a individual council to allow for online an online meeting of annual lectures if we and would that have to be a motion presented to council to ask whether there 'd be consideration for that miss brandon through the chair i am not aware of such provisions thank you thank you uh councillor thank you maven and um i 'm just a little concerned that 0.5 locks us into the venue of council chambers um thinking again about um covert restrictions if there is a more appropriate venue that is perhaps outdoors or have better ventilation or is much larger that may be a safer option for us to use um does passing this item including point five of these words reduce the chances of us being able to do it in a more safe uh ms branovich to the chair when we advertise the meeting we can change the location of the meeting in the public advertisement if we decide to hold the meeting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an issue to change it if we decide to do it in a different place thank you uh thanks councillor i i should also say that the idea about an alternative location is a difficult one as we discovered when we tried to explore a different location last year for a special meeting of electors where a lot of people were expected and we thought that town 's function room wouldn 't be big enough um so if you 're talking about an annual meeting of electors being in a different location to allow for either more people to attend or greater physical distancing we may encounter exactly the same types of difficulties ascertaining such a location within town noting we need to have recording abilities etc etc for that but yeah um we 've got some time up our sleeves potentially uh to work on that counselor lasandro um you had your hand up before but it 's down now um no um thank you mayor i know you 've addressed it through your comments thank you very much all right thank you so i 'll ask now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as amended no i 'm not seeing any descent so there being no dissent declare that carriage unanimously uh thank you everyone we now move on to the well actually items 15.2 15.3 15.4 have all been adopted by exception resolution which now brings us to item 16 on the agenda which is applications for leave of absence so the recommendation is that council one approve the leave with absence for councillor jasmine karemi for the dates inclusive of 11 april 2022 to 25 april 2022 and secondly approval believe of absence for mayor karen vernon for the one march 2022 um can i have a mover and a second to please um for that recommendation moved councillor i seconded council sandro is there any dissent there being no dissent declare that carried unanimously thank you um we 'll now move on to the next item on the agenda is item 17 motion of which previous notice has been given we have none next item is number 18 questions from members without notice are there any questions from elected members without notice council alessandro yes thank you matt vernon um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in future is the town investigating an option for the community to be able to make public questions or statements thank you direct that question to the manager of governance and strategy ms bryan to the chair yes we are investigating that option and we will be able to provide that update to two elective members um this week or next week thank you councillor homer thank you matt vernon i was just keen for an update on your smiley face speed sign we got a location for that or how 's that happening uh direct that question to the chief operations officer ms adams sorry maybe could you please repeat that question my thing is cut out i 'll get councillor homer to repeat his question thanks the uh smiley face speed signs which are on um douglas have no milk um [Music] george street sorry um where will they be and how long until we see them in town i think you might be slightly a step ahead of us there um councillor homer um like ms adams to actually say if this is something the town is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's progressing ms adams thank you thank you man um so through the chair that uh we 've been following that up since that was last asked at an earlier council meeting so our understanding is that 's actually a trial with main roads that the city of perth are doing so um we 're looking to see if we can also do a trial as well so we haven 't got a firm date yet on that or any fixed locations for that the reason for my question is i saw a line item in some of the budget notes of six thousand dollars for a speed time i assume that was related to that or something else uh thanks councillor homer are there any other questions from elected members without notice no um in that case uh we will move on uh to the remainder of the agenda items item 19 uh new business of an urgent nature introduced by the decision of the meeting we have none item 20 is public question time as there are no members of the public present in the virtual meeting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the meeting during public question time i will now close public question time the next item on the agenda is item 21 public statement time uh again as there are no members of the public present in the virtual meeting and all statements submitted in advance of the meeting have been read out during public statement time at the start of the meeting on our close public statement time item 22 is meeting closed to the public we have no matters for which the meeting needs to be closed to the public so at 10 18 i now declare at this ordinary council meeting closed thank you all for your contributions tonight i appreciate the patience of those watching on live streaming with our breaks and various matters and we will see you at the next council meeting so thank you and good

that have recently joined us and also to those who might be new to tonight welcome to the new age of webinars i 'm xander cameron and um i work for robert stay we 're the consultancy firm that 's been appointed by the town of vick park to assist in preparing the um the master plan for this project and with me i have kevin and andrew as well as representatives from the town of vic park jack haley and ellie and we 've also got our consultant team representatives as well before we kick off i 'd like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of this land and respect past present and emerging leaders their continuing cultural heritage beliefs and relationship with the land which continues to be important today i thank them for the contribution made to life in the town of victoria park and to this region so we 've got um quite a lot to get through tonight it 'll be a lot of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community as we go along as well so i 'm just going to spend a little bit of time rehashing for those that haven 't been part of the process today to give you an update on where we 've been we 're going to spend about 10 minutes going through the community feedback specifically and then we 'll open up to a q a session where we 'll address some of the questions that have come through via chat we 'll then talk to some of the preferred scenario direction that we 're looking on looking at based on the feedback that we 've received so far again have another q a session and then wrap it up with next steps so just to clarify in terms of a webinar the cameras are all off for a webinar i can see dave it 's actually nice to see another face there he goes but effectively um it 's just me talking the session will actually be recorded and shared and we do ask for questions using the q a function as we go so what we 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can actually type that out as we 're going and then we 'll come to it through the key sections and and talk and answer those questions and at the end of this evening if you 've got any further information or questions we 'd i welcome you to please submit those via the your thoughts website with the link below so just as a rehash why are we actually planning the town needs to be thinking about meeting the needs of a larger population it 's also about renewing the community services and facilities that are aging we 've heard very strongly about protecting and enhancing the green space and trees from the community and this whole exercise at the end of the day is also about responsible management of town resources in terms of the timeline and and and where we 're at um during february through to april we pulled together a vision of priorities with the broader community in terms of an online survey we had a range of listening post interviews and a vision workshop we then had covered that hit so we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group so in may and june we 've been working with the working group to explore different ideas through a whole series of virtual design workshops and here we are now in um in july where we 're actually working on the in terms of deciding the direction with the with the working group as well as the wider community to review the scenarios that we 've worked up and getting some feedback on surveys so the working group comprised of 20 community representatives including 10 site and 10 site stakeholders and as i mentioned before the early work that we did we came up with a vision and some principles all that information culminated into a vision and principles which was agreed by the community but also workshopped and endorsed by the working group as we proceeded as well so we 're using this vision and principles very much as the guiding framework to inform our design so it 's probably worth just touching based on some of those key elements again around better connecting people buildings and council services really looking at bringing in the cultural and natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and providing a welcoming space with immersive green spaces and a real mix of uses that can shape a unique destination into the future along with that vision we had a series of principles which have been shaped by the community and they are green forever a space for all mixed together so that the site is really blends in well with the park centre and albany highway and kent street and also very much about celebrating character so it 's about the collection of different facilities that can bring people together and celebrate what 's special about vic park so this vision and principles as i mentioned have really been the guiding framework to inform the scenarios and the work that we 've done to date so in working with the working group and what we presented at the most recent update was that we will have three scenarios that will workshop we did that we 've gone out for community feedback on those three scenarios and where we need to get to now is coming up with a preferred scenario based on those three scenarios and once that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community review and a detailed master plan post september so the purpose of tonight is to really give you the feedback on what those three scenarios were and um to provide some information around what we 're going to be doing to shape that preferred scenario so in terms of the community feedback that we actually received we received detailed input from their working group and thank you very much to all of you that participated and provided that information for us which has been really invaluable we had 105 completed surveys from the broader community with the average age of participants around 35 to 44 which is reflective of of of the local demographic it was also good to see there was a majority of eastvick park and vic park residents and 50 of the people that participated have actually not been previously involved in the exercise so it 's great to see that we 're getting that broader reach of people involved so in terms of how this feedback will be used as i mentioned before it 's really going to shape that preferred scenario approach that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weeks once that preferred scenario is resolved we 'll go into and it and it gets endorsed by council um presumably gets endorsed by council we 'll then go into the detailed master planning phase and in the long term it 'll obviously continue to shape planning placemaking and governance of the site into the future so in terms of um just the way i 'm going to present the feedback that we 've received tonight we 're going to firstly touch on some of the common elements and the overall feedback that we received i 'll then talk you through some of the individual scenario elements and the feedback specifically on each of those and then we 'll actually touch on how that feedback is going to influence the preferred scenario and the design direction so what are the key elements around access open space facility design and other uses that we 're taking out of each of the scenarios to prepare a preferred scenario so in terms of the common elements these figures actually relate to the feedback that was neutral through to support and strongly support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been some really common themes that have been coming back time and time again and not surprisingly these came through as very strong through these common elements as well so in terms of retaining the fig trees preserving the full size of macmillan park improving pedestrian access and really keeping and providing the space for all existing community facilities has come through really strongly as well as adding the more greenery and public space opportunities again improving traffic flow and car parking has come back which we can see um and interestingly there was also um 71 of people said they provided some [Music] support for some development to help fund the new facilities and open house open space enhancements and again safety and increasing activity during periods of night keeps on coming up as well this this here um is actually a culmination of all of the different questions that we asked to provide overall feedback for each of the different scenarios so if you actually filled in the survey you would remember there was a whole series of questions around the different themes this is this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i 'm going to go through these in a bit more detail over the next couple of minutes but essentially scenario two really had the strongest level of support with 58 of of support across the board um interestingly between scenario one and scenario three there was a very close level of 48 and 49 of people strongly supported and supported those scenarios so there wasn 't that much difference but there was actually a lot more people who are indifferent and neutral for scenario one we also asked a question like just going back to the vision and principles which scenario best reflects the vision and scenario three actually came out on top in relation to that particular question nine percent of people um said that none of the scenarios reflected the vision and five percent of people actually said that all of the scenarios reflected the vision so what i 'm going to do now is just a bit of a recap as a reminder in terms of what the scenarios were and then provide you with some specific feedback so scenario one was really very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing layout this is very much about a moderate cost scenario so it 's moderate cost for town to increase the facilities and very much minimal development so low cost low funding generation it was very much about rebuilding the leisure life and library pavilions in their um current area refurbishing and consolidating the bowls and investing in a cultured courtyard and beer garden um in and around the the arts precinct and the bowls existing bowls facility now in terms of feedback we had not uh 45 sorry 48 of people either strongly supported or supported the concept 33 were neutral and 19 opposed it in terms of key feedback that we received um there was there was a mixture of views people were generally um supportive of the range of mix of uses that were on site but there was mixed use in terms of the connections and in terms of whether or not to retain the bowls facility or not as well here 's just a couple of quotes that came through um in addition to the surveys as well so again um quite diverse views diverging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people probably thinking it 's not really ambitious enough so opportunities for development with scale are limited and should be maximized so while there will be some opposition density increases should be focused around the strip and family homes maintained further away but on the um on the flip side of that please do not allow private developments on the site it 's a community space and it should stay that way um there were some questions around the bowls whether it 's actually retaining the bowls in this location is actually necessary or not and maybe there 's options to consider relocation and we 'll come back to that as i proceed um through the presentation there 's also some feedback about option two or three need to be really explored because option one was a wasted opportunity to really create a vibrant and connected legacy for the town centre so this is just a summary of the um the feedback that um we received again for each of those different elements across scenario one here you can see that more people were very much um opposed there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neutral because this site was about limiting sale and development of council land so there 's differing views there um one of the recurring themes is uh really about whether whether the sale of land should be justified so people were very much pragmatic about the building design and the specs so there was actually some pretty good support for the for the building option in scenario one and in terms of spaces there 's some strong support here and you 'll recall there was the culture courtyard as well as retaining the existing green space pretty much um as is but generally people are reticent about the sale of council land unless there 's clear benefit back to the community in terms of some of the working group feedback we 've we heard that although it 's not it 's okay although it 's not very inspired it does however provide an option for those keen on a light touch approach people really liked that courtyard feel and the fact that the arts precinct was remaining they were quite happy for housing on albany highway but thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around the the bowls club in that culture courtyard in terms of scenario two this is very much about splitting the services so it looked at the call the courts and the bols center being co-located together but the library being relocated over to albany highway so it 's very much about mixing community and community and commercial services together and also providing a bit of a a frame for public activity around an expanded john mcmillan park so this was a moderate cost to get to town um as well as a moderate um increase in development activities so in terms of level of support from the broad community perspectives this scenario too actually received the strongest support with 58 um 20 were neutral and 22 were opposed to scenario two in terms of some of the key elements um the bowls in the park was an interesting um interesting notion 53 of people actually supported the bowl 's being relocated into the green space but 36 opposed it so that 's quite a divisive concept a lot of people were generally opposed to deck parking and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being having its own profile and a pride of place but also in a location that 's easily accessible to the broader public in terms of some of the feedback that we received i love the idea of providing as a space for aged care so those residents can be close and involved i 'm in favour of limiting the height of buildings as i 'm concerned about shadows so i think that the height of the buildings came through is a very strong um theme as well i 'm concerned about obvious plans for extensive residential and other developments to six to eight stories should be a maximum of three to four stories i think essentially the height is probably the compelling reason as to why scenario two actually um received the strongest support i believe in good design great landscape amenity and integrating as much greenery as possible will really put the town centre of vic park on the radar and i think there should be a clear active transport concept so transport parking transport management and parking has come through time and time again as a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for scenario two there 's very much strong support for the split facilities um in terms of other this is about housing not for profit spaces and cafes into this into the park so there is there is good support but there 's also opposing views there and um there was very strong support for the um the public spaces which include the tree line promenade and the active piazza this facilities here was very much about the bowls in the park and the library having pride of place on albany highway as well now interestingly although scenario two received strong support from the broader community when it came to the working group this was actually the least popular option so some of the feedback we had from the working group was that the community uses should front the park not dwellings there was concerned about the community facilities not linking together and wanting to make sure that there are those clock cross linkages and cross usage um and also some questions around the height of the sports hall being on the hill might be a little bit obtrusive there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the strip um other issues were about how those buildings function and also particularly the inter um concerns around how each of those buildings interface with the public open space in terms of scenario three this was very much about high cost high revenue generation so it really proposed that vertically stacked civic hub and town square within the site and really played up those public um space destinational playground and native um garden opportunities throughout the site as well as with housing housing and sustainability options there was 49 support for this um scenario 30 13 of people were neutral and 38 opposed but as i mentioned before interestingly this is the scenario which um which was more aligned to the vision than each of the scenarios that preceded it in terms of the key feedback people were generally supportive of the public spaces um there were big questions in relation to the building heights so people are generally opposed to building heights anything over around seven eight stories and upwards um there was also quite a lot of questions in terms of the facility design um so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite divisive in a sense where people either loved it or they hated it so some people liked the idea some people thought that maybe spaces might be compromised if everything was put together in a stacked building and likewise there was also diverging and mixed views in relation to private development some people very supportive other people very concerned about the heights that are actually proposed in this scenario so some of the feedback and it 's important that rate pays are not burdened by increased investment in the area without a proper return but it would create a superior precinct full of life and deliver increased spending and patrons for businesses along albany highway the design of scenario 3 seems to be the most forward thinking and best utilization of the space however i feel like the height limit is more in keeping with off five or six stories is more in keeping with the area and as i mentioned before that concern around stacking all the facilities together and potentially um meaning that you 're actually going to be able to come have to compromise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really stand on its own as a proud entity across three levels with plenty of car parking in terms of the feedback summary as i mentioned before in terms of the facilities you can see here between strongly opposed and strongly support is very divisive opinions in relation to the stacked vertically stacked facilities and likewise in terms of some of the other uses around housing and i think the heights are very much at play here as well aged care eco village strong support but also a lot of people strongly opposed and this is where the public open space has received really strong support in terms of really dialing that up and creating a unique destination so in terms of some of the working group feedback um my opinion is that it 's hands down the most exciting and game-changing option so i think a lot of people were very excited about the opportunities that this might provide in terms of vibrancy and really adding to the cult the culture and the flavor of the area but then a lot of people there 's the opposing views about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacked into one massive building and it could potentially be very um vic park like so um very much mixed views as we as we proceeded through so i might just break here um quickly and throw to kev to see if there 's been any uh questions kev hi everybody sorry i can 't seem to get my camera working tonight so you 'll just have to imagine my face maybe it 's a relief that you can 't see anything um we actually haven 't got too many questions through yet so i 'd encourage everyone there 's that q and a button ah that should pop up with lots of cancelling questions sorry that 's um you 're just breaking up a bit i think that was you uh yeah can you hear me okay yeah yep that 's good great so i just wanted to start with a question from mike which we said we 'd answer uh just querying on the design of the scenarios whether they all uh contained cafes and restaurants in the promenades around the park and the answer to that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario one only maybe had one little cafe ramping up through the scenarios the other questions that we received was also just querying the status of the gym and whether that was part of the concepts and that 's the same answer that yes the gym and all other facilities that are currently on the site um part of the reference group the working group 's guidance to us was to make sure that all of those existing facilities have a home in each of the three scenarios so the gym and all of those other uses like the child care and others are all in each of those scenarios um so yeah as i say any other questions please type away have we got anything in the chat no no no just the q a as well we 're asking for feedback at the moment all right okay so um i 'll keep moving then um and actually sorry to cut you off xander i just neglected to cover up another question um just querying how the survey was constructed and whether we asked people how we asked people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would ask people directly to nominate which option they thought was the best best reflection of the community 's vision for the site and then a lot of the a lot of the numbers that you 've been presenting tonight is where we 've grouped together all of the feedback on individual questions to try and get an overall picture about how people feel about each scenario in general so that 's how we 've gone about looking at that all right thanks kev um so in terms of how this actually informed the um preferred scenario direction so um i guess the key elements that um we are going to draw out this is really about the key elements that we 're going to draw out to inform the preferred scenario so there 's a number of things that we need to consider there 's the range of different views amongst the working group as well as the wider the wider community we need to really be thinking about balancing the feedback with operational and cost considerations as well we 're aware that we won 't be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that will continue through the detailed master planning phase so things like facility design and cost and land use mix and funding are going to be ongoing issues we 're going to have to continue to address and we need to be thinking about identifying areas for further planning and consultation as well so in terms of the key issues around so um we did structure the survey under a number of different themes so i 'm just going to be touching on those themes now so in terms of access and connections scenario three pedestrian links and parking were really strongly supported there was a lot of reticence around deck parking in scenario too and so a lot of people are actually concerned about the the commercialization of parking potentially in the future and therefore it will will be paid parking in terms of the um the the issues and the directions that we will consider we 'll be looking at refining and moderating the popular elements of scenario three around that fine-grained pedestrian and laneway network really looking at basement parking and dual access to and traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular albany highway and sussex and also looking at pedestrian passing connections around john mcmillan park for open space design there was strong support for the playground and the nature nature gardens but there was there was actually an element of support for less intensive upgrades so you can see here scenario three has very strong support here for the upgrades and the location and then but there 's also somewhat support for additional public spaces in the culture courtyard that was actually identified here in in scenario one so we 'll be looking at um the refining the elements of scenario three in terms of that activated northern park area with um the playground and the and the native guardians but really pairing that down so the level of intensity will be considered will be reconsidered but we will be exploring ways to increase the number of new public spaces in terms of the elements of scenario one and two we 'll be looking at how we can really build on that symmetry in vista which was well supported so the formal character the sight lines preserving those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll be about bringing the best of each of those elements together the issue as i mentioned as i touched on before in terms of uses and heights was quite a divisive one so there were very much mixed views on height and design scenario three you can see here in the yellow was um the moist opposed because of the level of heights and heights and design in scenario two received the most support so in response of that we 're going to be looking at reducing the building heights in line with more aligned with option two one of the key areas though will be very much about looking at what those um what the community benefit will actually be so in ensuring there is public benefit and prioritizing the community uses exploring the mid-rise lower scale buildings and not necessarily towers and looking at heights potentially between around three to six stories so there is as i mentioned before there is an element of support for private development but that really needs to be qualified against benefits so that will be an important consideration as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very much divisive in terms of the um scenario three so you can see here there 's mixed views on that stacks facility for scenario three so scenario three is in the yellow and there 's an element of strong support but there 's also a very strong element that strongly support um opposed to it and there 's actually strong support in terms of splitting facilities for option two as well so after scenario two so um in terms of strong support here for the leisure life design and location so in terms of the preferred scenario direction we 'll be looking at ways to situate facilities east of the park to really build on those linkages and collaboration and look at ways to really connect the recreation and the community uses but we haven 't necessarily resolved what that design outcome is going to be because it 's very much linked to cost and given that the community are reticent about the sale of land cost implications are going to have to be very important so what we 're probably going to explore in the preferred scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a improved option one um and sorry improved up the option one where the facilities are split and grouped together but once we do some more detailed planning we can really get down to understand what the cost what the function the scale and character will be and then come up with a with a detailed design so in terms of the stacked option that will actually explore ways in terms of the ground floor library community and then potentially the the leisure life on the second floor the rooftop bowls was actually well received but the issue is obviously cost so we 're really keen to continue to explore that and understand if it if it is actually feasible and viable and this really will leverage the opportunity to get that activity spilling out into the park but the other option that we 're proposing really we 'll look at that grouped option so rather than stacking all the facilities together potentially looking at splitting them across two facilities and that will potentially provide the opportunity for the library in the community to really be connected with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger area which will provide the opportunity for a basement car park potentially which will address the car parking issues that were raised by the community it will address the it will provide opportunities for that common circulation and co-location and as part of this we 'll also explore bowls in the park or potentially elsewhere so that 's going to be another live issue that we 'll need to work through through the ongoing engagement over the next couple of months so this group option will be similar to scenario one with the facilities being side by side but a higher quality outcome so funding was the other issue that was explored through the survey and then um we very much had feedback around the need to balance the sale of land against other funding sources so it 's not just about providing funding specific to the site um um so the community are very much open to looking at revenue opportunities um on the site as well but there needs to be that balance so you see here in terms of scenario three there is actually some strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for scenario one and somewhat support for scenario one and scenario two as well so what we 're proposing to do is really look at the detailed costings and funding opportunities through the detailed master planning phase um i identify opportunities to really prioritize external funding and look at ways to delink to link the development um to facility funding and community benefits so the community there were a lot of there was a lot of feedback about whether the sale of land is really worth it so that 's going to be something that we 're going to have to explore as we proceed and we also need to be thinking about what those broader economic impacts and whole of life 's costs are actually going to be and um and the and the wow factor and the impact that um that the development could bring to the um broader area so in terms of the um the summary of the key elements that we 're going to be exploring through the preferred scenario it 's really about combining an element of each of the options so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access connections we 'll be looking at that fine-grained pedestrian network and linking the park back to the highway in terms of public open space we will be exploring adding new amenities but also preserving those formal qualities of the open lawn area we 'll be keeping an open and flexible approach in terms of the two design options for the community facilities so they can be further explored through the detailed design phase in terms of other uses we 'll be looking at a reduced building height and scale and thinking about how we can make that general transition back to the park and exploring pragmatic a pragmatic approach to um to funding the site and making sure that that is actually linked back to community benefit have we got any questions kev only a few which i 'm happy to run through but again if anyone has heard anything just through that portion of the presentation that they had any questions or comments on please just um pop open the q a tab there and feel free to share your comments we had another quick clarification from renee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three and just to confirm that was um partially kept in its existing uh building but expanded into additional cottages with maybe more performance and event space incorporated uh let me just have a quick look at any other questions that we 've had come through a question about the potential to mix scenarios together and i think based on your comments there xander i think we 've outlined that we are doing a bit of a frankenstein of several of the options all right there 's also how can we make sure that access to space for all the community will be carried through to the planning stage um one of the one of the key elements that we 'll be looking at through the detailed master planning phase is also um that the town is going to be looking at a community needs analysis to really understand what the needs and facilities are for the community and making sure those um those elements are actually confirmed to actually inform the the final design jack have i answered yes hopefully i 've answered that may uh just another question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of detail around land areas and ownership details and the particulars of what is being proposed and making sure all of that is mapped and presented to ratepayers when we get to that next stage of planning and i think with the towns confirmed there that definitely yes if the community finds that valuable we 'll make sure all of that information is published and made available for review all right so we got any other questions that are coming through do you think we should wrap it up hang on um how did the town come up with the open space increases this seems a bit odd does um kev or andrew want to answer that sorry andrew can you answer that because i think kev 's yeah sure um it was a combination of factors really a large factor was um the community desire to retain trees on the site uh so we 've done that in a series of um open spaces and also in response to uh feedback that the community would like to see a variety of different open spaces so not just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions and have that variety of experiences throughout the precinct uh if you can hear me okay i might just add that a key design element that seemed to receive quite broad support was the idea of a sequence of open spaces kind of moving from albany highway through to the park through the gloucester street so creating those additional smaller open spaces we 've progressed almost as part of our journey through the site we 've also got another question just querying weather regardless of the scenario that 's adopted if it will include scepted or crime prevention through environmental design requirements a great question and an issue that 's been really clearly raised by the community as a concern in terms of how the area functions today so all of the design scenarios that we 've developed and andrew i might throw it to you in a second just to clarify um have really had that front of mind and how they design uh the park the sight lines through the park how the buildings meet the edge of the park things of that nature yeah and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we maximize the number of entries uh and um i guess eyes on the street not only at ground level but also um at upper levels through housing and that 's i guess one of the benefits of housing is it gives you um eyes on the street at different times of the day to to other uses so it 's a around-the-clock passive surveillance that we 're that we 're really looking for a few other questions rolling in one querying whether there will be any hirable office space for tenants or for flexible use that 's certainly something we 've been exploring particularly in relation to the sussex street law center who we know need office space and it 's definitely a use that we 're contemplating something with some real community benefit there to explore definitely a potential candidate for that ground floor activity that andrew was speaking to the question is also querying whether there was a any provision made for an outdoor cinema screen such as in northbridge piazza and i think that is something we 've been prospectively looking at in option three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have to have a look at the dollars involved before we can make a new form or commitment to that um i think we had another question there querying whether the sale of town land would be looked at as a means of funding community facility development the other council land property part of me and i believe the position there is that it 's a consideration we 'll be looking at and exploring the town 's other land assets but um it 's ultimately going to be unlikely that there 'll be enough land available to cover the costs of these kinds of facilities fully without compromising other competing objectives around the town so it 'll be part of the mix part of a broader balance that we 'll have to look at further a few more questions coming in as well feel free to jump on those xander if you had any um i think yeah now you 're out keep going kev you 're doing good job i think we have one there just regardless of the option chosen what kind of time frames we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really yet to be established something we really have to bed down in this next phase of detailed planning in terms of how long things will take to transition what kind of staging we might have to account for to make sure that services aren 't interrupted over that period but i do recall broadly we 're looking at a 10 to 15 year horizon when some of the identified costs and upgrade works in existing facilities uh come to be realized and we need to start making some change so maybe that might be a an indicative time frame for now and then we 'll make sure that we bed that down with some specific dates going forward um there 's a question and i 'm not quite sure um what is actually being asked but um it 's it 's saying um in terms of more building selling public land and more open space looks wrong for the same area of land are you now counting private space as open so i 'm not sure if that 's um talking about the the public open spaces and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't know if it 's a clarification in terms of the public open space within the development areas yeah it 's um i guess the the key change that we 're making in these scenarios uh compared to how the site is today which is what that kind of change is uh comparing itself to is kind of really rationalizing the area of non-public spaces around the site today so for example the car park on albany highway uh the parking areas around the site and particularly the footprint of the existing balls club and rationalizing the overall area of that allows us to increase the amount of public spaces across the site and kind of create a more formal public space network some of those places might be quite green today but they don 't really have an open space function so that 's the change that we 're proposing in these scenarios there 's also a question around um whether um state and federal government funding to a lesser rate increases is actually being discussed um i think that the whole point has been um exploring um ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's it 's been identified and it was identified at the working group as as something that the community would be keen to explore but because we 're not at the point of um we haven 't done the detailed master planning we haven 't actually gone into that detail yet but it 's definitely on the radar and a key consideration and i think certainly the feedback that we 've received from the broader community and the working group is that i guess the amount of you know theoretical land to be sold within the site to fund all these community facilities isn 't supported they wouldn 't like to see that much land sale and development occur which then really obliges us to look at state and federal funding uh other council revenue uh external grants and you know those other funding means to contribute to this infrastructure there 's also a question in terms of the delivery timetable regardless of the final option that 's been chosen um did we did we cover that one off oh you may have sorry if i missed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that people would like us to further explain um a key question there just raising the issue of climate change and how that 's being designed into the spaces services obviously the long-term function of all these facilities going forward um very much the key point of feedback that we 've heard from the community and the working group and i suppose there 's a range of detailed strategies which we can reference and touch on at this stage that will require some more detailed thinking and work as we look to things such as a detailed community facility architectural design where we might incorporate sustainable building principles there detailed landscaping design where we need to be looking at native or climate change tolerant species and the use of water and things such as that so it 's definitely an issue that we 've heard is important and one that we 'll be incorporating into the the following phases of planning it came sustainable built form and um it came through very very strongly through the working group discussions as well also and also reducing uh the heat island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as possible so there 's a question around whether hawaiian has participated in this webinar or indicated they wish to be consulted hawaiian were actually um were on the working group they were a member of the working group and we 've had some meetings with them offline as well so we have actually been discussing with them as part of this process and there 's also a question around will there be electrical charging stations for electric cars i think that 's a good question we haven 't gone down to that level of detail at this point but i think it 's a great a great consideration that can be included there 's a question there around biophilic design which is a great one around that broader topic of climate change and biofuelic design is basically where buildings are mimicking nature i guess and i think yeah that 's a really exciting opportunity that we 'd like to explore going forward um a key question there around the level of support for some of the alternate land uses or complementary uses that were explored in the draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for things such as aged care and housing and some of the initial surveys that we conducted back in february and that 's definitely a very valid point and something we 'll be working through in terms of which uses most appropriate and how the community feels about those potential uses but it has been interesting to see in some of the latest feedback we 've been looking at a much higher level of support for some of those initiatives and i think it was in excess of 70 of the survey respondents suggesting that they 'd be happy to see some balance there between those other uses to help fund this new infrastructure in public space but definitely no uses are being confirmed at this stage and anything that does occur on the side into the future will be subject to the usual amount of community consultation and detailed planning and there is a comment there around taking into consideration the preferred um aspects of uh across the three scenarios and not just um focusing necessarily on housing and aged care and i think that 's that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback about what um you know what whatever investment there is there needs to be that community benefit so that 's definitely something that we 're striving to do and we would be interested to get continuing feedback to make sure that those um key element all of the key elements that benefit the community will um will stay on the radar so there 's also a question around why the town is trying to do a redevelopment scheme here when there 's so much undeveloped and vacant land on albany highway and competing with the existing ratepayers for rents um and i guess this comes back to the core of the project in terms of the fact that it is town land and um the facilities are aging and looking at um different funding models and options to actually be able to reinvest back into the community i think that 's a very good point i think there 's really we 've heard that there 's little appetite in the community for uh development for development sake and i think the approach that we 've we 've taken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about playing for public space it 's about planning for the kind of community facilities that we 'd like um and getting that right and then any other development we 're really only contemplating in terms of how it could help contribute to that funding or what other benefits it might bring to the wider community in the local area and the feedback we 've had is that the uses need to be community related uses and that the issue about competing with existing rate payers and existing businesses is a real issue that needs to be taken into consideration i think we 're um we 're fast approaching seven but a final few comments that have been coming through um room for the tgif markets in those scenarios definitely i think we 're looking to increase that amount of unstructured green space to be as flexible and usable as possible for those kinds of more ephemeral events will the library have a local history section uh definitely something we 've heard as a popular idea uh heard from the librarians themselves in fact but that might be a detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what else have we got addressing matters of homelessness raised um again a common element of feedback and i guess the various strategies for dealing with that issue are complex and multifaceted but we have been approaching this in terms of activation and use and crime prevention through environmental design broadly but it would probably require some some more targeted strategies to address that going forward there 's also a question around a performance theater as well and i think that 's um that 's an interesting um the use which has been um which has been on the radar as well and i think will definitely um need to be considered and incorporated in terms of understanding um understanding feasibility and need and whether it is actually um a viable opportunity i 'm not sure where the questions go on but i did see one come through just querying um how the community and the working group will be engaged and consulted going forward sandra if you wanted to touch on that one yes and i think that was in terms of the master planning process i think um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i guess the detailed master planning is a separate process so but there will definitely be a um a um community engagement um element that needs to be incorporated but it 's probably going to be more targeted um there will be elements that will need to be more targeted so we will come back um to the members of the working group and let them know what that once actually um that has been resolved um there is another working group meeting that will be held in the next couple of weeks as we go in to finalize the preferred scenario before it goes to council and public advertising as well and so yeah i think without wishing to preempt the detailed consultation planning that still needs to be undertaken there yeah i think if this phase is really that kind of broad visioning and planning i think we can expect that the consultation will be more focused and detailed as we go forward maybe it might talk about how a particular building functions and its uses and its design or a similar questions about open space or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going forward okay do you think we should um wrap it up for next steps i 'm just it 's seven o 'clock are you happy with that kev no more questions i don 't see any more coming through but as always uh your thoughts dot victoria park dot wa dot dot a u slash npm we do have a comment box there if you did have any other queries or questions uh you can get in touch with us there so as i mentioned at the start this is by no means the end of the um of your opportunity to provide feedback we 're going to be going back to the working group and getting um and council over the next couple of weeks we 'll then be going out to get some feedback on the preferred scenario in august so there is another opportunity so tonight 's really just been a snapshot of what the community has been and the elements that we 're we 're looking at potentially taking into consideration to shape the preferred scenario but there is that opportunity for you to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um be going to council in say that the preferred scenario will go to council in september and presuming that gets endorsed we 'll then move on to the detailed master plan phase which will run from september through to 2021 and that will really look at again the detailed master planning but also further consultation so we 'll be back in touch with a more detailed program at that point as well so thank you all very much for tuning in apologies again for the it hiccups that we had at the start of the session um but appreciate very much appreciate your time and also to everyone that actually participated in the feedback through this process we look forward to any more comments or questions if you 've got them on the your thoughts website and getting feedback again in august once we go out again for further feedback thank you everyone for your time thank you everybody good evening,"(-31.9826524, 115.9054062)"

perspective is learning language and simple one which you might all know kya meaning hello when I go to schools now here in little was like kid come running up the gate and saying kyon is the forest it 's just so empowering for me and I just think it 's just wonderful we 're making so many inroads it 's just brilliant language was never lost language was taken away people people like Ronnie 's mother and my mother and our grandparents taken the missions and things like that and languages flogged out of them and taught to speak English and not to speak their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's happened in the past and some in terms of our colonial history they 've been no bit unpleasant but it 's about acknowledging those things we 're going to move forward together in face the spirit of reconciliation and acknowledging our shared history we need to come experience it and understand it that 's one of the things that we are hoping that we could be doing as part of the rap with the town is for the wider community should know our history and giving back the proper names that we know so here look in commemoration of yagan tragically killed July 1833 erected by the AEGON committee he was a worry of our people like he was always fighting against the settlers doing wrong by our people when you tell me about those things I think about the sense of reconciliation in terms of how far we 've come this was known as a cause life Aboriginal people for thousands and thousands of years and there was a huge connection to the river the Derby arigon advic Park being a really important place in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and it 's shown in strong diversity I think and that 's one of the things why we really wanted to live in big part our history is embedded in the country we feel that connection is new our people we like to do some environmentally friendly work in terms of picking up the rubbish and making sure that this place is as pristine as possible because that 's what our people did for thousands of generations as soon as raps came out we were on ermine a great idea because it 's about holding people accountable making sure that reconciliation is at the forefront of everything it 's really important to us to build that community around us and build meaningful and respectful relationships and we do have that with a lot of people in the town of Vic path we do the little events here and there but I think having some really awesome supporters of our group as well did a high profile has been yeah there Fred Chinese and Ben Wyatt 's of the world and that 's been a really integral part having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all going anyway good good yeah it 's been a busy day as usual you know it 's like yes I hear that you 're about to launch your rap the reconciliation action plan it 's the first one we 've ever done actually it 's taken a few years and we probably learn a fair bit from and a few dead ends we 've gone down first one is always the toughest because you 're starting from scratch you 're trying to create something of significance but you 'll find as the years go by and you move to a second or third rap they 'll get easier and and in fact probably more focused we did a lot of work building a new strategic community plan and talks about us being a thriving in connected community and obviously our indigenous populations are really important to us we want to make sure that we sincere about the the things we put in place in the relationships we build and restructure the entire organization to make sure these sorts of things happen so we 're hopeful for a really good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be relevant for government so if you want to provide your services well to old citizens and you this is an important part of it so we will move on to the rap process there are some really detailed comments I would ask the group to consider and provide feedback for us tonight in terms of going forward with the rap process because the rap is a living document no there 's nothing that I saw that I thought most of it was all stuff that we could add value to the rap in the city year mmm the nature of reconciliation is that it will mean different things to different people that 's why I having your engagement group having community feedback is always so important because it needs to come from your local community in this case Victoria Park in the town of Victoria Park the aboriginal engagement strategy group will come together to really make sure there 's a key focus on implementation of the actions in their plan and that rapport with the council 's understanding what their direction is and making sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to do something in this place is pretty important I think they 're on a big education journey at this point congratulations it 's been a long time coming I 've lived here 30 years and it 's just so good to see this canvas parishioner it 's a document that there 's a lot of sort of says something about people 's intense interest now a friendship and relationships all about that mutual respect so you take that forward into an organisation call it something different but it 's the same sort of values [Music] welcome everybody at the clear the meeting out acknowledge the traditional custodians the land adorn our people and pay my respect to the elders both past present

of your agenda have a mover please deputy mayor Potter do I have a second at council I 've up to you counselor Park Thank You mr. mee the reconciliation action plan is an important tool for reconciliation in Australia by developing our rap we joined with over a thousand other corporate government and civil organizations the rap is a strategic document that sits with our business plan to assist the town to turn our good intentions into positive actions it is my hope that the relationships that have been built and will be built between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and our organization as well as others in our community will be positive strong far-reaching and long-lasting I 'm so impressed with how far we 've come as a nation in our ability to acknowledge there is the past and their willingness to continue to grow there is still however work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology ten years ago is all we need and acknowledge not only history but the importance of

park we are always looking for new ways to connect with our community so when the opportunity came to create a film to support the 2017 NAIDOC theme our languages matter we thought it would be a great opportunity to work with future leaders in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community to better understand the role of language in connection to culture language is very important in indigenous culture because it 's the way that we express ourselves whether that be a verbal or nonverbal how we express ourselves is a part of identity if someone took away that expression of Who I am I wouldn 't know how to communicate not just within my own family but within Australia and the world as a whole through that stolen generation we lost that connection and trying to find and gain that bath has been a long hard battle for most families legislation in this state study in the early 1900 's was about taking language and culture away since that legislation has been written out of the statutes there has been a movement about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that sort of movement in the early 1970s places like this you know would never have existed in universities the Centre for Aboriginal studies is for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from all over Australia moving forward it 's the education of non Aboriginal people and with that becomes more awareness respect and acknowledging Aboriginal culture and acknowledging the first strains with the amount of different languages that the indigenous culture has it can be quite difficult sometimes to communicate with mob from different country in Australia there is about 250 to 300 different languages but on top of that there is actually four hundred or so dialects so you 've got Perth y junkion which speaks new language but then all of these countries around hill actually speak a variation of na na language is an important cultural identifying but not essential you can still be o no now without speaking weduc language but it 's important for people to have opportunities to learn language if they want to and young people to learn more about culture Merlin primary school is in East Victoria Park close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back onto Curtin University so this year Nate ups them being our languages matter we 've looked at that across the curriculum so the first person we employed at the start of NAIDOC week was a lady called Gina Williams and she 's really leading the way for languages in waa she 's actually got this amazing song called one Jew one Jew means welcome to know her country so it 's really bringing life to the new language which is a really great way for teachers to latch onto that and really start embedding it back through the school system [Music] that 's for kaya and welcome to be large and then for all about secondary languages within the school to be represented within that sign as well the role of our Aboriginal Education Committee is to ensure that the strategic approach that we 've put in place is actioned and we 've all got roles within that so it may be around the NAIDOC committee it may be around accessing relationships with the wider community like we 've done with the town of Victoria Park and we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got Aboriginal elders coming into our school as well as some funding to help us with our bush tucker garden good afternoon everyone my name is Nolan I come here today to talk to you about the kind of art work that I do and you can have a go at it yourself something else I want to just say a bit about was the language I don 't come from down here I come from a place called Payne 's fine the language group up there from my great-grandmother 's people is buddy Meyer Roger it we lost that language we didn 't speak for many years and only one person has left to actually speaks that language he 's 82 years old and he put together a language dictionary with all the Aboriginal words from there so we 're learning again to speak that language million primary school has always had an aim of being a very impressive school we always have had a number of cultures but of course it has always been quite a large population of Aboriginal children there is a real desire to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their language okay so we 're gonna be teaching the year 3 is how to do head shoulders knees and toes in your language do you guys know any new language body parts my favorite body part is the mouth I like Jenna feet first I think it 's like a really good because we 're learning no culture it 's really special and two it 's very fun the reason I became a teacher was to really send that message to children that they can be successful so finding all those real positives that come from the culture and really trying to reignite that as a hope for the future [Music] when I 'm older I just wanna share it with my kids so they could pass it on to theirs and it like keeps on going one of the key features of the schools is that they are a perfect place for people to not only learn but to support one another and we see future ambassadors from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups being formed within that context the aboriginal engagement strategy group is really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invite participation from elders but we also have younger representatives as well we are working in the town to reach out to build those relationships and to help people achieve what they want to achieve I make my low board a and dingy which is all the way from Cairns Queensland and so there 's no one here who speaks my language so I 'm trying to learn by reading from a book Mawile that is the sea turtle and that is my totem so I was given that because I 'm always on the move and so I see Turtles as the indigenous support officer I 'm involved with many programs one of them being outreach where I go to the schools and discuss the possibilities of higher education unfortunately common feeling is that if you can 't speak your language it doesn 't make you Aboriginal which is quite sad really but there are opportunities out there for you to go out and learn about your culture and learn your language if that 's what you want to do we don 't really know a lot about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trying to keep large and something that we 're losing which is really sad I 'm a longer kid but I can 't speak the language I find it very difficult to understand someone my friends when I was in calculus a lot of indigenous languages are not spoken as fluently and as often as they were once upon a time so I feel like it 's very important that in schools there 's some sort of indigenous education as far as language goes for indigenous students as well as non-indigenous students to learn and so that we can continue to progress and keep these languages alive so that we don 't lose as many as we have in the past so instead of learning languages like you know Japanese nudity 's and even though that 's really important learning other cultures it would be better I think to learn Australia 's first languages instead of languages from overseas I 'd like to pass my culture down to young ones and teach them about our languages me my brother learned about Aboriginal ones because my mom teaches us I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a lost language if we keep using it the resurgence of language and connection to culture is something being embraced by younger generations and needs to be supported by elders community and Australian educational system 3 understanding acknowledgement and respect we can achieve a shared vision for a connected empowered community [Music] [Music] you,"(-31.9826524, 115.9054062)"

cuttable camber vampire Voyager Nesta and Armidale together with more than six hundred men had all joined the growing list to RA n wartime losses in a year during which there was little to celebrate for Australia 's population at the time the year began with a growing sense of trepidation as the war spread to the Asia Pacific following Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor the war that had begun in Europe two years earlier had become a truly global conflict the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 created genuine concern throughout Australia the Japanese forces had gained momentum southwards and soon Malaya Singapore and the Dutch East Indies had fallen never in Australia short modern history had our Shore has been under more immediate threat those concerns were realized on 19 February

where the recs remain today it was not long before the units of the Australian and the United States Navy 's were in action in the Coral Sea sorting Japanese attempts to invade Port Moresby by sea that battle between the u.s. and Japanese carrier fleets raged for three days it was the first great naval action fought between aircraft carriers the Battle of the Coral Sea was significant as a strategic victory for the Allies it marked the closest approach of hostile naval forces in strength to our coastline it broke the long series of Japanese victories and it showed that the Imperial Japanese Navy could be defeated the Battle of the Coral Sea is also significant in the history of our close relationship with the United States indeed in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enduring alliance allied success in the Battle of the Coral Sea had tactical implications for the Japanese forces who were then driven to make landlord approaches from the northwest northern coast of New Guinea to capture Port Moresby for Australians the result would be the epic bitterly fought struggle on land which began at Kokoda and one which eventually drove the Japanese completely out of New Guinea in 1943 in 1942 men and women at home worked as never before to build new warships in our naval dockyard Australians repaired the Battle Damage of those ships that have been in action and prepared them to return to war Australian men and women built modern fighter aircraft in makeshift factories in field hospitals and in Australia the wounded were operated on by skilled surgeons and nursed back to

means to them the Australian disguised the arches and were blue his Bush Bond winds were warm and sweet and yet from earliest hours he knew the tides of victory and defeat from fierce floods thundering at his birth from red droughts ravening while he played he learned to fear no foes on earth the bravest being God ever made the bugles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his lean brown band to shape Imperials destiny he went by use grave purpose wheeled the goal unknown to cost on weed the promise of his blood fulfilled the bravest being God ever made we know it is our deathless pride the splendor of his first fierce blow her reckless glorious undenied he stormed those steel line cliffs we know and none who saw him scared to hide behind his reeking bayonet blade would rob him of his title rights the bravest being God ever made bravest were half a world of men I brave beyond all earth rewards such daily none shall charge again to the last breaking of the swords wounded or hail one home from war or yonder but a blown pine laid give him his due forevermore the bravest being God ever made today we honor the legend of the Anzac which was one of hope mate ship and courage this morning we stand in silence and reverence while we reflect and pray and mourn we acknowledge those who had to fight and those who lost their lives for our gain I find it challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hard to relate to the fear and the extreme amount of courage that would have taken to stand up and fight what they didn 't know then was freedom today we 've lived sheltered lives and although it 's challenging to try and understand what the Anzacs would have gone through I do understand the power of hope it is through hope that we are able to pull through difficult times as a nation I understand the importance of solidarity and unity by looking at the Anzacs we learn what it truly means to be Australian all those to be Australian today looks very different to what it looked like 102 years ago by gear is still the same to not leave a soldier behind and I know that thanks to the efforts of the Anzacs their spirit and their sacrifice we live a very good life I do understand the power of faith and compassion which like mate ship is fundamental in shaping Australian identity today I understand that together we stand here this morning together in silence just as the Anzacs did it was under state where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day of conflict and division that came nationwide unity and reverence it was on this day where we learned about the importance of togetherness so as you go about your day today feel the warmth and reverence that surrounds you in honor of our fallen soldiers open your arms open your heart to all Australians and joining them in acknowledging this day this morning we stand in silence we stand in respect we acknowledge those who fought and those who died we stand in hope and we stand together lest we forget Thank You Raymond and Mishka Paul Solomon and Hayden Curtin from Kemp streets in your high school will now also share with us what as a day means to them when World War one broke out in 1914 Australia had only been a nation for 13 years our new nation was eager to establish its reputation amongst the nations of the world so eagerly agreed to the call from England in an attempt to knock Turkey out of the war and open a new supply route to Russia Australian and New Zealand troops along with those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 1915 the battle quickly turned into a stalemate over 8,000 australians died this had a profound impact on the Australian nation and the 25th of April became a day to remember the supreme sacrifice that Australian soldiers have made although the Gallipoli campaign failed in its military dictor 's the Australian New Zealand actions during the campaign left us all a powerful lazy the creation of the Anzac legend has become an important part in the Australian identity and that day to us isn 't just about Gallipoli it 's about the sacrifice that individual men and women of this country have made and continue to make to the rest of us live our lives in safety it is the height of freedom courage mate ship and everything that our wonderful country offers us although it 's associated with the Anzacs of Gallipoli we commemorate with everyone who fought on the battlefield in the past

the first Anzac Day the soldiers of New Zealand who helped to create the name and set we recall all those who gave their lives in the Royal Navy the British Army the Royal Air Force the Merchant Service and another British and Dominion forces and we think of those British men and women who fell when for the second time in history their nation and its kindred stood alone against the

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the town 's traditional inherited dredges in inventory the register of heritage closes and is classified by the national trust of australia the town is undertaking a master plan process will determine the best users of the site for the future for many generations to come the home is a fine example of the building constructed in the Federation Queen Anne style which features include the Jarrah staircase by the way the Janus staircases look very carefully some of the staircase has been repaired that was vandalized by some people press metal ceilings and you probably noticed we haven 't actually tampered with the festive need repairing this cold fireplaces and staying last are the stained glass for the stained glass to see through the ravine the behind the front door was smashed to smithereens they 've been reconstructed luckily there 's some photographs taken prior the destruction of the beautiful building is not only a fine example for my architecture it 's a great example of how the community needs change to overtime for the influence of social change and world events the boarding holds a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town is working and developing a plan which is which will benefit the res the rich history and sheer beauty of the home are things to reason to be respected and celebrated the time and town aims to do so when you wander through the house just cause sometimes dismissed you 'll get a feeling its dismissive is an important place it holds a lot of history we 've got the maternity hospital returned soldiers we soon solve this free second horrible this place here which was built during the Second World War if you actually crack off the reliable plaster on the building itself you 'll find the lads of made of metal and printed on them is made in the USA so most that building was actually shipped here in the USA we 're very proud today to be launching the ripple history this afternoon in 2008 a contract to rival the book was awarded to the university of wa center the West Australian history dr. Susanna Thompson was chosen as the author the book is symbolic of the town 's ongoing commitment in preserving the heritage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial contributions by the town grant received lottery west information will come from many sources particular towns with the district election the collection is rich good source of material made possible with private donations and the generosity of individuals who are happy to share with us a piece of out of their history as we side the town 's local historian for history coordinator Diana Wilson goblins any donations deflection at any time thanks must be given to professor Jeffrey girl who wrote the foreword of the book Beyond Messaggero a history of Victoria Park is a narrative of the changing social landscape the victoria park the story of its people and how they have lived and worked in the district that covers everything from pre-european settlement happen to 2007 there are many people who must be knowledge for their partners project the elected members from town of Victoria far both past and present my fellow members of the past local history advisory committee and current written history project team including community representatives of dr.

West Australian historian and author to share the Knicks good deeds in the early stages of the school the book is available purchased here today and we will be available at the hummer more than coffee so over here I would like also to introduce professor different altar and commendable five will be of professor Mr Man the deputy their distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen if you 're not able to hear me and you would like to hear me wave your hand otherwise i will press on regard you may ask what is the north perth boy doing career path oh let me start with the episode that definitely a few years ago I was asked to give an address at the chapel of the christian brothers college trinity college just over there in east perth and as it 's customary and as more man 's done I knowledge the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stewardship of the land afterwards archbishop it took me aside and rather quizzically said Geoffrey I enjoyed your address but you do realize that all this was underwater when they look I were running the voice and my everything of course the river has been a most important factor perhaps the most important factor in the way that the largest city of Perth has grown and it 's particularly important for Victoria Park is because we 're Trudy volatiles that was where there were the low-lying islands and the shallows what is now burswood here aspire and that was the best crossing place for nagar over many centuries and the white people when they came over the same passion the course y equals built in eighteen sixty two three and then what happened will have a very curious thing in the region around easter a suburb was starting to grow up by the name of victoria park and that sublet decided to write the other side of the river better and migrated so then you may find the name victoria park on one or two very old maps but essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now there 's a significance about this those of you who have been to London will know that the more though he hand side of it southern the place where Shakespeare 's Globe Theatre was the place where talks is going set up but it was always a place which was a little bit different an alternative society you think of Paris with its famous lift in Australia we 're not all that any capital cities with a decent-sized River first brisbane hazard south bank which is again become the cultural center so i guess victoria park has been destined to stand in relationship to the city of perth as we left fact us to these others and although for some decades that was a well-meant but misguided attempt to amalgamate victoria part of the city it 's resumed its autonomy and if anything comes out of the current proposals for the change in municipal boundaries about which i express no opinion then victoria park however it is a name with a history the aboriginal contribution has been given through justice in this going but the most of us remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals now I think of an elderly relative of mine who was a markup Ladner over on this side of the river and who in the age of 19 driving his horse and cart across the causeway somehow fell off and recovered consciousness in Perth Hospital to find the nurse trying to cut away his Charles 's to see if he dislocated his hip and he roared unhand that seemed to me a typical bit of Victoria hard spirit I think of the way in which the homesick

AUS,WA,Town of Victoria Park,TownofVictoriaPark,https://www.youtube.com/user/TownofVictoriaPark,Nicki Ivory - The five key drivers for sustainable and profitable business in 2020,sc8VZWrklMQ,20150617,633.24,"Victoria Park, WA, Australia",1825,so I 've been asked to give you 10 minutes on my thoughts on the five drivers of what will make sustainable and profitable business in 2020 so in the future now I have to say I 've shamelessly drawn on the research that Deloitte has done in this sort of space Deloitte Access Economics and some of you will be familiar with chris richardson and his team who are very famous economist in australia so they do some wonderful research and very user-friendly research and you can find it all on our website and there 's a series called building the lucky country business imperatives for a prosperous australia so very much on topic for what we 're going to talk about today so i have lent very heavily on that research so these publications there four of them today fifth one is coming up later this year as i said you can get them off our website but the premise behind them is that Australia 's future prosperity requires sustainable sources of national wealth visionary strategies for both business and government and an ability to execute in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sort of the underlying premise which is a good segue into our topic so I 've tried to distill it down into five key drivers out of some of this material so the first one is sustainable sources of wealth so really it 's the question of where should we be playing where should our businesses be playing to be sustainable and to be profitable and build the lucky country three which is called catching the next wave and basically it comes from and says we 've had all these waves of investment of the years we 've had the wool boom we 've had the gold boom we 've had iron ore boom where is the next wave what what should we be focusing on and it focuses on where 's Australia 's natural advantage because in order to be sustainable and profitable you need some kind of advantage so where are natural advantages and where do they intersect with what the world wants or where the opportunities lie and they 've distilled it down to five the fabulous five we call them they always have to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world wants and they very quickly guess so Asia ones clean air so anything to do with guests are we seeing a lot of that already in wa wealth management so again it 's a lot to do with what 's happening in Asia the maturing of those economies and people saving for retirement we 're pretty good at that we 've had a superannuation industry that 's been sort of 30 years in the making so we 're pretty good at that tourism we 've got a lot of natural advantage there and people want to come to Australia agribusiness again feeding into Asia and the desire of a growing middle class to access better food sources an international education which we 're already pretty good and so they 've sort of been identified as the five which are the next wave of opportunity but then there are another there 25 in total the deloitte growth 25 and mining sits at number six which is interesting because you think everything you read in the papers doom and gloom and mining where can the growth be but of course we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mining will come back again and there will be growth because we have a lot of what the world wants and needs in them in the mining space and we do it well and we 've got a cost advantage in a lot of industry so mining will come back we shouldn 't write mining off and then there are 19 which look a little bit more so it 's not so much the international opportunities but they 're obviously domestic opportunities as well and health and the aging population a big feature of that so any business that 's looking at solving some of those problems has got a lot of opportunity domestically it 's certainly in the next five and Beyond years so there are a couple of left-field ideas in the in the 25 as well but I thought it was quite a good spot to look for businesses that are going to succeed in the future don 't necessarily have to be in those 25 but those are the ones we should be fostering saying a lot of successful businesses are going to come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next one digital disruption and I hope I 'm not stepping on Richards toes here is our digital futurist but we 've all seen it in our everyday lives we 're all welded to our smartphones and we 've all seen our lives change over the over the last sort of 20 30 years this is an ongoing process so one of the publications looked at where are the sectors in our economy that have got the shortest fuse from a digital to digital disruption perspective and where 's the biggest bang going to be so who 's going to be the most disrupted who has to change the way they do business to be sustainable and I mean the most important sectors we found there were financed retail we 've all seen it happening in retail how many people buy online now instead of going into the shop media and the dying newspaper we all read about information and communication technology and professional services which is of course where our businesses and we have seen this certainly over the last three or so years really as an accelerating trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've had to be very agile and innovative to almost stay ahead of the game and do things differently defend our business and our profitability and I think that 's the key message is people who are innovative and agile and work out how to deal with the impacts of disruption will survive and of course those will also thrive or the ones who pick up on the new business opportunities that come out of digital disruption so I always like to say you don 't want to be the codec in the room you want to be the Facebook in the room you know it 's sort of it 's that Kodak died because they didn 't realize that their whole business model was about to be completely disrupted so when they had the opportunity to buy digital they didn 't and they died the next driver is productivity now this is bandied around a lot Yuri you know in the papers every day about how we 've become less productive technology and other structural changes have driven huge amounts of productivity improvement over the last 40 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of what we 've seen over that period but in the past decade it 's sort of fallen a little bit by the wayside I think particularly in wa when mining companies were chasing growth at any cost productivity didn 't really feature in the equation but of course it 's very much back on the agenda now and it 's not just about how you can do more with less so how you can make technology make you more productive but obviously the big focus at the moment is on costs as well and we did a publication at the end of last year the build the lucky country for which had a look at what are the biggest drags on productivity and I economy and very interestingly it was red tape you 'd also yep government too many rules but it it 's not only about government it 's about the red tape we impose on our own businesses so the private sector is as big a culprit of this as the government sector and we did some quantification of this and the economists came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 250 billion dollars they reckon over-regulation costs a economy so that 's the cost of actually administering regulation and then also the cost of complying with it and two-thirds sorry two fifths of that comes from government three fifths of it comes from private business themselves so the rules that we put in place that we trip our own selves up on and of course the economists have done a lot of research on this it 's that numbers big but it 's the knock-on effect of stifling enterprise and innovation and sapping incentive that 's probably the biggest cost of red tape so we really need to fix the red tape problem in business in order to drive sustainable growth which leads me on to we also need to fix it in government so have a number four is government reform and we know this again he also read it in the paper a lot that the government knows that reform is needed and this is tax laws workplace laws service delivery by governments building infrastructure there 's lots of examples of where reform is needed but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound two election cycles so it 's really hard to put this in place and we can see that with what the current government is struggling to achieve any meaningful reform but if we don 't do it we really run the risk of losing out on those opportunities I 've spoken about and optimizing our ability to create sustainable businesses in the sustainable wealth and protect our living standards so their tongue is sort of the four that I 'd is still out of the Deloitte research so then I got to number five and I thought that 's all great it 's all very tangible things and they 're all out there already but what 's going to glue this all together what 's going to actually make it happen and really we need some kind of a cultural change we need a mindset shift we need people to recognize that this needs to be done and then just get on and do it and we need to stop whinging and saying it can 't be done and we need to find ways to just do it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit that is in our society so that people can go out and build sustainable and profitable businesses thank,"(-31.9826524, 115.9054062)"

Thank You Lee thank you thank you thank God who wrote that stuff oh wait um anyway thank you thank you Wow and yes firstly thanks to the town to for inviting me here Nikki and I were comparing notes before and because we hadn 't actually hadn 't met until today although we 're connected on LinkedIn the other day and we sort of talked about what what we 're talking about and we 're coming from a different perspective which will be reassuring for you that you 're not going to hear the same thing repeated Nikki 's perspective is macro and I think mine is probably small business and micro and also with a tinge of digital stuff plugged into it so the key I tried to narrow it down to five but then I was as I said to Nikki early on I was talking to some of the other day and he came up with another point I thought I just have to add that in so I had it I developed this really i thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get even cheesier but i developed a bit of an acronym to help me remember these five key points started so the first ones w the second one starts with a the third one starts with I and then the set next month 's tea and then there was another one that I added on called e and that sort of that was wait and then I was talking with some of the other day and he added in this other thing and I thought oh that works so so I 've got my acronym called waiter which is a bit kind of cheesy because we 're in a restaurant so so the first one is w okay W key drivers for success sustainability profitability in 2020 outside 2015 and 2020 and probably in 1820 and probably in 2120 is why the W stands for why why are you even in business the business for my observation the businesses that get very clear on why they 're in business and remember why they started the business and remember as they go on why they are in business and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve and the ones who are very clear and who can communicate clearly the Y for their business are the businesses that are going to be are going to win those that forget why they exist in business why they even started the business and just drift along in some institutionalized bureaucracy of their own entrepreneurial but it was entrepreneurial once but now that they just do the same thing day after day and wonder why customers are going somewhere else they 're the ones that are not going to be sustainable because they 've forgotten their reason for existence even if they ever knew it so first W is get very clear on why the business even exists who knows Simonson Eck there 's a guy some internet if you 're not if you haven 't heard of summer to neck SI n EK is his center really really good he gave a brilliant TED talk a few years ago it 's it 's on YouTube the golden circles of from simon Sinek where this is the three circles and the first one is why the second one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get very clear on why we do something before we figure out how we 're going to do it and then what we do is what we deliver to customers but as simonson excess customers don 't buy what you what you do they buy why you do it okay so i get very clear on why and communicate why next act next part of my acronym is a the a now from a technology point of view the a stands for adoption adopt what I 've observed over the last 20 years which is and longer is people there are some people who adopt technology just because it exists and there are others who adopt technology because it can add productivity to their business others adopt technology kicking and screaming because their customers are kind of complaining that they 're that they haven 't got it and need to offer it and some of them don 't don 't adopt technology at the latest technology at all we call them the laggards so there 's innovators the early adopters what 's called the early majority the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to be adopting technology where your customers or what your customers expect from you and your business and one of the keys with adoption for sustainability is to be near the leading edge but not too far ahead don 't be at the bleeding edge because by definition that gets pretty bloody rough out there the bleeding edge is not a pleasant place to be the leading edge is a better place to be sometimes it 's okay to be back from the leading edge but where you don 't want to be is behind your customers expectations with technology because your customers will go somewhere where they can find a supplier who meets their expectations when it comes to a technology solution what are the customers wants what is it what does the customer want what if the customer need what does the customer expect and the then that 's a part of the game is to then say we need to be using a technology solution that is ahead of what their customers want need and expect but not too far ahead okay and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different times and they 're not all the same so there 's a big challenge there that 's the a adoption of Technology by the way I when I was kind of came up with my little my little waiter acronym I thought hey this is a pretty good formula for a whole day workshop so I 'm going to condense it down to 10 minutes we 'll see here we go so because because it 's one thing to talk about some other thing to say oh how do I then implement that okay so the next one is I I is for integration integration of systems integration of services integration of sales channels integration of databases integration of your stuff with your customers your stuff with your suppliers accounting systems that aren 't integrated with other parts of the business exists by definition on their own websites that don 't integrate with back-end accounting systems in an e-commerce world the sooner or later cause lots of grief and in fact it 's one of the reasons why we set up see a digital it 's not a commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CI digital is to is to allow people to have the ability to get some advice around e-commerce systems for their websites it actually can link into accounting systems and so these systems need to integrate together the opposite of integration in my view at least is fragmentation and the businesses that get really curly mucky are those that exist in a fragmented confused world where they 've got different systems that don 't talk to each other so integration is I think are going to be a key driver Adam we 're talking a micro level for a business the business systems the business information needs to be integrated throughout the business okay the next one you 'll get this one as soon as I say it the T actually who knows what the teammates stand for not training that 's pretty good actually we could this could go all day if I play this game back we 're running on live later ten minutes names already way so the T stands for trust I think Trust is the big in all right they 're all big actually but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust you and if you 're like if customers don 't trust you they will not be dealing with you that 's a pretty obvious thing the more businesses do trust you or the more the more you can show that other customers trust you the more you will attract more customers to one of those great things about the web is if you have a trust if you have a cite a website that shows that obviously people trust you then other people who haven 't even heard of you before are going to start to trust you implicitly the reverse is also true if people don 't trust you and if your website doesn 't look trustworthy then they 're going to go somewhere else and they 've got lots and lots of choice trust is one of those other things though that 's not just about customers and websites and customers and business Trust is about people people need to trust each other systems need to trust each other in order to connect together and businesses need to trust other businesses and so this is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything together both in the online world in the offline world and it 's going to be even more powerful and even more important in 2020 in my view the e we 're up to e and in this in this beautiful akron ism acronym akron ism acronym called waiter e is for experience now when i first came up with my ears I was were kind of walking around last weekend I didn 't invent this by the way I 've invented waiter but I didn 't invent this word is experience its customer experience but when I thought customer experience that 's good let 's call that an e because it kind of fits in E it 's all about experience but it 's about the experience customers have when they deal with your business experiences a business these things we could call as a guy back in the 80s did called moments of truth those guy called yarn Carlson who wrote a book he was the head of Scandinavian air services one of these classic story wrote a book was called moments of truth moments of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have a moment of truth was it a positive moment or a negative moment no moments of truth are neutral there is no neutral when it comes to moments of truth it 's all about the customer experience customer service is kind of a subset of customer experience customer support is a subset there 's all sorts a little subsets custom experience is so important whether people want to go back and have more of that experience or whether they want to have less the other thing about custom experience or about experience is it 's about getting people in your business who have the experience so the ephah and the waiter acronym is for experience both customer experience and also internal experience which brings me to my last point I 'm right on time brings me to my last point which is the are now who who would think what what could this be in the same in this same view anyone got any ideas R stands for well that 's very good but it 's not it because that 's an obvious one now that 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one other like when I first gave me the repetition that 's very good reputation that 's very good as well but they 're all pretty good but yes after it oh my god no that 's not very good no no rock n roll that 's very good no so come rush stop i 'm trying to rush no no ah all of those things are probably right except for except for right and the truth is is not about right or wrong it 's about what can fit into a 10-minute presentation so but the are the biggest are i reckon is responsibility its responsibility of the people in your business it 's the responsibility that you have for your business it 's the responsibility that people in your business have for it it 's the responsibility you have for your customers your willingness to take responsibility for the outcomes of your business and to put up with the stuff that goes goes along with taking responsibility because sometimes that feels awkward when someone 's having a go you and to stand in the heat when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say way we actually provided that thing you 're right it doesn 't seem workers we promised it would we will take responsibility for fixing it or making it work as opposed to bugger off you 've I 've already sold it you can go somewhere else and get you know whatever but the customer also has to take responsibility for what they buy in the web industry and this one of my one of my beefs in the web industry there 's lots of stuff that 's sold that should never have been sold people buy the wrong thing for the wrong reasons but equally customers need to take responsibility for buying the right thing for the reasons that make sense to them so customer responsibility is one of those things it 's mutual the business owner and everybody in the business needs to take responsibility for what 's going on but the customer has to own the responsibility as well and as long as there 's going to be joint responsibility between customer and supplier there is a good chance that there 's going to be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a whole lot of other our words but I would I think responsibility and the ability for people to the willingness for people to take responsibility and to really live it every day in their business is going to make a huge difference to the sustainability of businesses in 2020 thank you very much,"(-31.9826524, 115.9054062)"

Town Council Alex from erage will be presenting the home composting workshop for us today all right Alex okay oh hi everybody I hope you 're doing well we 've got your muted so I can 't really hear but I hope everyone 's doing well out there and yeah happy more people joining in along the way as well I 'm here sitting in my backyard really do predators in the workshop to you so if you have nice background there and I hope the other sun 's not shining drunk in the camera let me know if there 's any issues I 'm sorry Alex I just forgot to mention if some will just leave all the questions till the end and there 's two options to ask questions either through the Q&A button or there 's a lift your hand button on the right hand bottom right hand corner as well we 'll wait for questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and then we 'll take live questions all right sorry Alex [Music] looking I guess if there 's any technical issues as well just message shadow on the Q&A and she can respond and resolve them as we go good okay so composting at home this is a workshop that Alice Springs town councils obviously putting on as part of of their work around reducing waste and we 'll be looking at how you can compost at home particularly what you can do with your food scraps and have a compost bin we 've got a presentation here and I guess she 'll you and I can discuss about how to make this available to people later if anybody wants a copy yeah well we 'll be putting this up on their Facebook page yeah okay great sounds good all right so you should all be able to see the presentation now composting at home is that right Charlotte yeah great good okay so when it comes to composting at home I think a really good question to ask yourself is why do you want to compost at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's two main reasons to reduce waste and to produce fertilizer for your garden when it comes to the reducing waste side of things there 's this great little graphic I found here from compost revolution showing that nationally we produce 5.3 million tons of food waste going to landfill every year and that in turn by rotting down and producing methane produces sixteen point five million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent released into the atmosphere each year from food waste it also releases acid poison in the groundwater so if we can reduce the amount of food waste going into landfill then we can reduce both the amount of space we 're using in landfill and particularly we can reduce the carbon emissions associated with it so here in Alice Springs we 're looking at seven point six kilograms of organics per household per week and about half about is food waste now Charlotte has one or two things to sure about what council is doing in this area there 's three of you quickly Charlotte yeah so councils currently running a food organics Garden organics trial so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collecting your food waste and turning it into compost the trials in the process to being run run out to 200 households in the community and the aim of this trial is to in the future have it rolled out to the whole community excellent so that 's really good to hear that their initiatives like that happening in our Springs and that will make a huge impact on the amount of waste going into landfill it might also have an impact on the decisions you make at home about how you 're going to compost at home so remember when I said there 's these two reasons reducing waste and producing fertilizer I think it 's really worth asking yourself which one of them is more important to you because it 'll make a difference as to how your compost if reducing waste is more important to you then what you 'll be doing is trying to compost as much of your waste as you possibly can even the difficult stuff or maybe you 're better off just giving all of that stuff and they 're difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that system is up and running if it 's more important to you to produce really good quality fertilizer well there 's a whole bunch of difficult to compost things that you might lead out of your compost heap and you will instead go for just the really high quality ingredients in your compost to produce the best quality compost you can so you still composting at home either way but you can see how it starts to affect the decisions you make about how you 're going to do it so I think that 's a really good question to ask yourself at the start why are you wanting to compost at home you can certainly do both but one of them might be a priority okay now when it comes to compost there are lots of different sorts of compost made in all sorts of different ways and you can see a few examples here from you know industrial scale to backyard level and worms and you know all sorts it 's probably worth defining a little bit what we 're talking about when we 're talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't so there is actually an Australian standard for compost believe it or not and bagged compost that you 'll buy at the nursery or something like that should have an Australian standard little label on it and the Australian standard for compost outlines that compost is essentially organic material that 's been through a biological process of bacteria to produce a garden and then something you couldn 't your garden or soil them in but I believe is the term they use now gets way more complicated than that but those three things are really important we 're talking about organic stuff we 're not talking about inorganic things like rocks or cement or and obviously it 's organic stuff things that things that have lived and it 's going through a biological process a bacterial process to to change it into something that you can add to your soil so it doesn 't matter whether it 's industrial level or at the backyard level we 're still talking about the same kind of thing even though there 's a whole range of different products you can make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know worm castings and all sorts they 've still been through that process so when we talk about backyard level stuff which is what we focused on today there 's also a range of ways you can compost in your backyard and we 're not going to talk about all of them here I 'll mention the the range of them but we 're going to focus in on one in particular so there 's closed bins where the bins are entirely sealed or mostly chilled there 's aerated bins where the where the bins have holes in them for aeration so they 're not sealed there 's tumblers which some of you might be familiar with there 's Bokashi bins which is starting to get quite different an anaerobic method of composting as opposed to all the others which are aerobic methods of composting and that just comes down to the type of bacteria that is doing the composting for you the aerobic bacteria which are the ones we are going to be looking at are ones that need oxygen to compost the anaerobic ones they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oxygen so underwater or sealed or something like something like that so but cash is quite different it 's it 's much more similar to pickling or fermenting or something like that percussion and then there 's worm farms as well which technically not going through a bacterial process but it 's a larger animal that 's doing the composting for you at that point so it 's really a type of manure and I won 't go into worms today either because they are a little bit more complicated hearing on Springs it 's hard to keep them alive during the summer so if you want to know more about that that 's that 's something for another day and you can certainly research stuff online there so we 're looking at the top three mostly and I am going to recommend if you want to comp us at home I would say the best type of been to use is a sealed sealed the reason for this is with a sealed bin you can control the moisture a lot better which is a an issue here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a lot better we know that flies are a real issue here if you go for an e-rate had been with holes in it it 's gonna get fly blown all those flies are going to come straight in your house so that 's really not a great outcome with the sealed beans you can control for for flies and for cockroaches and you can even control for for mice and rats and things like that much better certainly it keeps dogs out if that 's an issue for you so I would definitely recommend sealed bins there 's a whole range of them this one that you can see on the slide is called a guillotine and they 're available all sorts of nurseries and outlets and whatnot it 's not the only sort of sealed bin I recommend it 's just a picture that I found I happen to use these at home I see they 're quite good but you know no one 's paying me to say that there 's all sorts of receiver bins that you can use that are going to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do composting at home well the essential bits are you 're gonna need your outside bin that 's your sealed beam and you 're going to need some sort of kitchen caddy or something of the sort to carry all of your scraps from the kitchen to your bin on a daily basis you 'll probably need a shovel and some gloves you 'll need the kitchen scraps and you 'll definitely need some dry leaves or straw this is really essential for the composting process it has to be a mix of of kitchen scraps and and dry leaves or straw so we 're talking green and brown ingredients there carbon and nitrogen we 'll get into that later and personally the way I do it at home is I have a bale of straw that I just keep next to my compost bin and every time I put the kitchen scraps in I 've put in an equal amount of the straw dryer leaves from your Gardens also great you know grass clippings can also be good too we 'll get into what 's good and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff you can use there with the kitchen scripts but drivers and strawbe up the best way to go there 's a few optional things as well you can get some other compost that 's working well as a bit of a seed you know seeding the bacteria into it you probably only need a shovel full of that a composter you can see the pictures of them here these composter is I think they 're a really great idea if you want to make sure you compost in a sealed container there 's other ways to do it you can use a pitchfork or there 's other sorts of compost errors as well not just these but the corkscrew ones I think they 're pretty good and the other option is compost spray so this is basically a liquid that has compost bacteria in it and if you spray it in your compost heap it just helps it get going quicker if the bacteria going quicker the bacteria you need in your compost heap already exists in the soil so it is enough for you to just put your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bacteria will start breeding but if you want to get it going quicker or if you 're running into trouble there then combo spray is a really good way to go okay so in terms of the process what to do right well first I would be recommending that you dig your bin into the ground about a hundred millimetres okay so that means dig a a ring shape 100 millimetres deep put your bean in it so it should be the size of your beam and then bury the bottom of you 've been to that 100 mil this will stop pests getting in particularly it 'll slow down rats and mice and you know slow down dogs and whatnot inside your bin I 'd then recommend putting a layer of sticks at the bottom they don 't be very big you could even use coarse straw or mulch if you have it but I think sticks are probably this the reason for this is just to make sure that your bottom layer remains aerated and gets a bit of drainage I used to I used to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you know surely we can just do it without it and I 've done a plenty without it but when when I do it with the sticks in there I find it does work there it just helps that drainage at the bottom you you just get a less mocking compost heap at the bottom so I think it 's a good way to go they don 't properly break down in the end but that 's okay you just pull them out use them in the next one or something of the sort okay so once you 've got your bin in the ground and you 've got your layer of sticks at the bottom you are then going to start layering your scraps and your straw or leaves in alternating layers so kitchen scraps straw kitchen scraps straw that means every day when you bring out your bucket of kitchen scraps you 're going to need to put a layer of straw on top of them not underneath you want the straw on top of the kitchen scraps so that while it 's sitting there for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day it 's got straw on top okay that 's important it keeps the moisture in it stops the Flies breeding does all sorts of things now you can see over on the right-hand side the green little box they 're saying if you do about equal parts of kitchen scraps and straw so and I 'm talking volume here not weight like we can 't weigh it so just use your eye and and make it a similar volume of kitchen scraps to straw that will give you the ratio of carbon to nitrogen that you need you may have heard people say things like I 'll you need a ratio of 25 to one carbon to nitrogen or 20 to 100 or whatever it is and that 's true you know the best recipes for a compost do involve that kind of ratio you don 't have to worry about measuring it at home just do equal parts and it will it will work out pretty well if anything I 'd lead towards lean towards slightly more carbon to nitrogen so slightly more of your straw and leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment see how you go okay now you can see the little circle down the bottom this is a really important part of having a successful compost heap at home make sure that all of your kitchen scraps are cut small cut small to golf ball-sized or smaller okay you don 't want big chunks there things like you know pumpkin or you know bread or anything like that just sitting in the middle of a compost heap it won 't break down and if it 's not breaking down in compost it means it 's rotting so you 've just got a pile of rotting food in your backyard you don 't want that so take the time to cut it up small in the kitchen before you bring it out it 's the best way to go the last thing that I 'm saying there is you add some seed compost early on so early on in your pile just to get it all going it 's optional you don 't have to it 'll work fine without it but it 's not a bad idea and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your compost bacteria needs to live is it needs air because there 's an aerobic compost it needs water because they will shut down in a dry environment and they need to feed on carbon and nitrogen ok so it needs that dry and the kitchen scraps it needs all of those things to keep going alright there 's a couple of different ways you can manage your compost tea once it 's up and running and once you 're adding all the layers to it there 's the hot compost method and a cold compost method the hot compost method it 's pretty simple it just means that you 're stirring it regularly so you 'll need one of those cork through stirrers or something similar and you need to be stirring it pretty regularly this will keep it really well aerated and it will mean that the the compost heap is composting at a pretty high rate as you 're going the cold compost method means you don 't stir it you just layer it and you leave it this is a slower method but it 's less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a disability or something and it 's harder work for you to to be turning that compost heap all the time called compost a great method if you 're just busy and don 't ever time to be turning it some people don 't call compost is a great method it will take longer okay so for instance once your bin is full and when I say full what I really mean is 80% full don 't try and fill up the whole way full it just means it 's a lot harder to manage if you 're using the hump hot composting method and you keep stirring it once it 's full your compost should be readily using about 2 to 4 weeks certainly no sooner than 2 but you might be lucky it might be quicker than 4 however with the cold compost method you do need to give it a lot longer to cure so if you fill it to the 80% and then you need to put the lid on sorry you need to cover your compost with soil to seal in all the moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to dry out cover with soil close the lid and wait for 2 weeks once you come back after 2 weeks you 'll seal that see that what 's happened is it 's actually it starts to dry a little and it comes away from the edge of the compost bin there 'll be a gap between the compost and have been so the compost is shrinking as it breaks down and as it dries a little what you want to do then is you want to fill those gaps with soil and cover it again with soil and leave the lid off now you 're gonna leave it for 10 weeks and then at the end of 10 weeks it 's going to be cured and ready to use ok so you can see that takes 12 weeks after you 've finished it takes a lot longer but it 's a lot less work so he 's gonna pick the method that 's right for you hot compost or cold compost okay how do I know when my compost is re well the best way is to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it it should feel light and a bit moist not dry it should feel crumbly not sticky and big clods it should be even and dark brown in color or black blacks also good and when you smell it it should smell good alright it shouldn 't smell bad it should smell earthy and a little sweet but if it smells sour or stinky or anything like that it 's not ready or something 's gone wrong okay and I think possibly one of the best ways to work out if your compost is ready is when you look at it you shouldn 't really be able to recognize any of the stuff that you put in it at the start okay so on the left hand side you can see there 's eggshells there 's corn husks there 's banana peel that 's not ready on the right hand side you can 't really see many of the ingredients you can 't tell what they are they 've broken down this compost looks a little sticky sometimes you get compost that are drier and crumbly but if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah that 's really I 've got it in my garden that looks all right okay so this is a common question people have what can I put in my compost heap and what can 't I before I dive into this I think it 's really worth being clear often people hear rules about what you can and can 't put into your worm farm and assume it 's the same for you a compost heap okay it 's not exactly the same although to be honest if you followed the rules for what you can and can 't put in as one farm and did composting with that you 'd have a really good compost it because you 'd be composting all of the really easy to compost stuff and you get a really nice compost feed out of it however you can add some things to compost the count to worm firms for instance this list here on the left left citrus onions bread oil dairy some weeds grass clippings bamboo cutlery and crockery so you 'd biodegradable stuff you can add them at home if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful with them so I 'd only be adding small quantities at a time and I 'll be cutting about pretty small and I 'll be experimenting with them if you 're not sure so you know don 't do something like take home all of the bamboo cutlery and crockery from an event and think that you can just shove it all in your compost heap eternal compost it won 't a lot of that stuff 's designed to the industrial of composted so yeah you 'll need to cut it up and just try bits at a time that 's particularly the case with citrus and onions and bread bread is often a bit of a killer but people don 't realize and you think breads fine in your compost heap but if you 're putting whole slices in or whole lumps of bread you can just sit there and do nothing so you do need to cut them up oil is probably best left out in your compost heap but if you 've got little bits you can put it in and then your the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say definitely don 't put in your compost of who hid droppings is a key one cats and dogs they contain all sorts of pathogens that can make you sick and so it 's really important to not get that into your compost tea meat and bones I wouldn 't do it at home it can be done in dust really I wouldn 't try it at home it 's too much work certainly bones you 'll never break them down you 're just it up its lines in the compost heap and meat and fish as well you run the risk of them just sitting there rotting and attracting dogs and things like that so I wouldn 't be putting them in the compost I would definitely not put couch grass in your compost heap because it 's still alive and it will just grow in your compost heap the best thing to do with couch grass and in fact other listed weeds as well listed weeds are weeds that the anti government has declared as a way any of them I would be putting in your bin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recommendation of Landcare and the weeds branch because Alice Springs Town Council have good protocols in place for management of weeds of the tip and they can manage that stuff down there it shouldn 't go into green waste don 't put her into green waste nobody wants your weeds in the mulch they 're buying from Council put it into general waste and then council is able to manage that Charlotte do you want to say anything more about that just while I 'm talking about it um yeah well part of the boggle trial or one of the benefits of the food organic garden organics trial is that you can actually include things like meat and bone and fish and because it 's a composting on a larger scale they will actually break down yeah yeah that 's right so yeah that lift list on the right there of definitely don 't compost at home a lot of that in fact just about all of it can be composted by Town Council so yeah that 's a great way to go a good point charlatan perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials you know rocks concrete plastic you can 't you can 't compost that stuff it 's not organic nobody nobody can compost it an interesting one is biodegradable plastics okay they 're often designed to be composted at a facility like what Town Council will be running they 're not designed to be composted at home your compost heap is not big enough and it 's not hot enough to be able to do it and disposable coffee cups in particular don 't try and compost them they have a plastic layer on the inside that 's not organic and can 't be composted so they need they dealing with in a proper facility okay so that 's the list of what you can and can 't compost in terms of troubleshooting here 's a great list this is often questions that I get asked about compost you know my compost smells bad what 's going wrong or it 's not breaking down it 's slimy or I 've got flies and maggots in it these are all really common problems don 't worry if you 've got these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with compost and it just needs a bit of managing usually it comes down to one or two things it 's I 've not got enough oxygen so it needs more air rating or it 's drying out and so it needs more moisture so you can see if it smells bad you 've got not enough oxygen and you probably not enough carbon if you had more carbon in there which is your dry straw and leaves and things like that it would be naturally oxygenating it more de raising it more and also to be heating it up for so you can try turning your compost and adding bulky carbon materials or pulling it apart if you really need to so that last one you can pull it apart and put it into a compost heap to try and resurrect it but that 's sort of a last resort option that one as we go down this list you can see that a lot of the solutions are pretty similar okay so if it smells bad if it 's slimy or if you 've got flies they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet and not enough oxygen and probably not enough carbon so the solutions are all similar if you 've got issues of it 's not breaking down that 's got powdery gray mold or it 's got ants and cockroaches it 's too dry at that point so did I say too dry last time I think I got that wrong before the smells bad and slimy and flies that 's too wet too wet not enough oxygen apologies whereas if it 's if it 's dried out and has cockroaches and one that 's too dry so not noting moisture and probably not enough nitrogen you need more kitchen scraps and things like that in there you could add manure as well as you need to to get going the only other one that needs a slightly different solution is if you 've got mice or rats or dogs or something like that getting in then probably a compost bin is not sealed well enough you might say the cut your scraps up smaller as well and I 'd definitely be looking at pulling out any of the difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that builders are just going next door habitable and it can still be me despite the steel venkat apologies a good trick that that I got told a while ago to stop rats and mice getting into your compost heap is when you 're digging into the ground put a layer of chicken wire underneath it while you 're digging in and that will stop them getting in it will need to be fairly fine chicken wire you know mice in particular pretty small can get through pretty small holes but that 's a good way they keep out rats and mice and dogs or okay well everybody that is the end of the presentation so what we 'll do now is if anybody has any questions we might have a bit of time for questions I think it 's about 20 minutes left sorry Charlotte yeah do this yep so I 've got two questions here from Sharon so one is why do not recommend the cummerbund over the field bin oh okay look no tumblers are great as well I don 't have any problem with tumblers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're great I do think the seal bins are a little better just because they tend to control moisture a bit more you need to be a little careful with tumblers because when they 're not full enough they dry out quickly and when they 're too full they 're hard to manage and hard to get things to break down in but there 's certainly a great option tumblers can work really well I 'd just be really careful but making sure you 're cutting your stuff up small and getting the right mix of kitchen scraps to to your dry material in there so keep experimenting with that you may find that when you 're starting off a new tumbler you might need to water it a little bit just because they can dry out of a start when there 's not a lot of material in them and particularly in the summertime so there are problems that people run into with tumblers but tumblers are a great way to go I would say the two options that I would recommend in general are seal bins and tumblers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a phone right the other question was can horse manure be used as a substitute for a straw and leaf there well look manure in general that 's something that people debate backwards and forwards in compost circles about whether you should consider it the carbon material or and nitrogen material because it kind of has both if you 're talking dried Horseman you are then yes you probably do want to wet it down a little it needs to be a little moist but I wouldn 't be using fresh fresh horse manure like if you have your own horses and you 're you know basically taking them in your daily no I wouldn 't say that 's a great idea in your home composting but if you 're if you 've got access to just sort of you know scrapings from a stable or something like that you know mucked out stables yeah that could be fine give it a go just make sure that you 're not getting big dried lumps in there you might want to break it up a bit and make sure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars manure should be fine generally what I tend to recommend that if you 're going to use manure is to not use a bin so much but go and make yourself a big pile so we didn 't go into piles this time around because it 's it 's a different way of making compost and it 's really not good for using kitchen scraps in because if you just put your kitchen scraps into a big pile of manure that 's open well you 've just got a big pile of you know food sitting in the back of your garden that dogs and you know everything you kind of get into but if your took them in you oh you certainly can make a big pile it needs to be minimum and mater by a meter by a meter and you need to build up the layers and water it and everything so there 's a whole other method bit that 's probably more what I 'd recommend for horse manure to be quite honest I think the other reason why it 's worth doing that method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tend to have nematodes in them so for experienced gardeners round here you would have come across nematodes which is a microscopic soil worm essentially it 's a type of worm it 's not an earthworm they 're they 're not not beneficial and you tend to get them in horse and camel manure and see it need to be getting compost pretty hot to get rid of the nematodes so that 's probably a better use of your horse manure to be quite honest and the nematodes aren 't good because they can get in to your tomato crop and that kind of stuff that 's right yeah what they end up doing is they end up feeding on the roots of your of your vegetables and it really stunts the growth of the veggies so yeah people have been guarding here a long time would have come across them for sure and if you pull out your plant and you see that the roots have like nodules all over them literally knotted and gnarly then you 've got nematodes there are ways you can deal with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't mind nematodes at all and you can use things like marigolds to try and get rid of them but you need to go pretty hardcore with that we 're also seeing people Solarize whole garden beds with black plastic to kill the nematodes probably the best thing you do is just try and keep nematodes they ask as long as you can so yeah bit of garden cleanliness and hygiene is the best way to go great does anyone have any other questions if so could you please type in the Q&A box or raised your hand and if not we 'll bring this session to an end all right well thank you very much Alex that was very informative I enjoyed that presentation thanks everyone small crab but dedicated all right everyone yeah like I said this video will be available online as well all right Thank You Ike bye,"(-23.7404675, 133.8482142)"

Planeteers'),uA0REVhr6fk,20211001,749.44,"Town of Alice Springs, NT, Australia",1832,[Music] [Applause] [Music] hello my name is alex i 'm 17 years old and i 'm a local resident here in alice springs i attend st phillips college and i 've been a part of the town council youth action group for almost three years the idea for this project came about when i was a member of the anti-youth roundtable in 2020 as part of the round table i had to make a project and for my project i wanted it to be environmentally focused and to incorporate the young youths of my town i used my connections in the youth action group to generate the planeteer program this program was designed to help youths to learn and to gain experience about everything environmental to begin with an environmental survey was issued for the use of the town to complete and after that we applied for a grant to run the program i feel like the best aspects of the workshops were getting to meet new people learning about the environment and developing lots of new skills i have been to two of the planeteers workshops the first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second one was the sustainable body products they were very good i think getting to do it with people who are the same age as us and have learning new things that we haven 't learned before yeah we also got to create a lot of stuff that we could take home and i found that a really great thing the best aspects for me were knowing that i was doing something for nature and or learning about climate change and various other topics such as companion planting and how to identify plants i think the best aspects on the workshops was actually being able to be fully um hands-on and doing it because um we weren 't just like taught like some things and had people do it for us we did a lot of the hard work as well for me the best aspects of the workshop was building a wicked bed like the one here which is my brother 's and learning about the methods for controlling buffle grass and revisiting um climate change statistics and implementing ways around that at my house where i can um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff and you learn how to um employ your skills in everyday life and i would definitely give them a thumbs up to going to these workshops it was a fantastic program i saw a lot of kids get a lot of enjoyment out of it they built a lot of skills and from one perspective it was fantastic to be able to be involved as well and just work with the opportunity to do some stuff with my daughter it was fantastic so yeah love to see that continue i enjoyed every single one of them especially the last time i got to make myself some motion that was really good i 've learned how to create a working bed a food forest and i 've learned how to use companion plant how i can use stuff to recycle to like make things um just like did you make wing beds up all these different things like rocks glass and stuff as well as like different ways you can recycle the workshops have helped foster my gardening skills and i 've been able to identify buffle grass in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to remove it for example i didn 't realize that fire wasn 't the best method i would always thought it was just burning um then poison um i also think that um learning about recycling and companion planting was a new thing i learnt and it 's been really good to learn about irrigation and water supplies especially in a desert well i 've learned a lot about permaculture which i didn 't really know much about and so i 've been trying to use that because i have garden beds at home so i 've been trying to use a bit of that in my garden beds and one of my favorite workshops was well the body workshop where we well where we learnt to make um things for the body which were healthy and organic and we made some lip balm which is really good yeah yeah i learnt a lot of things but um some of the things i learned were um about body scrubs and how to make them um these are all the point um ointments and body bombs that we made um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we got for making more of this stuff and then this is our um beeswax paper um quite flexible and yeah it 's a real um good thing and yeah you can make it out of any sort of materials learned a lot about what is better for the plants and um like how often you should do certain things for the plants so that they have like a better chance of growing and like these two are good for scents to get off certain bugs that could eat the other plants and supporting each other after completing all four of the workshops we all received a planetary certificate and it is recognized as an introduction to permit culture so it 's a great thing for us all to put on our resume and when we 're applying for further jobs we also got given these course notes which have plenty of really good tips about gardening and how we can incorporate permaculture into our daily lives and live more sustainably i 've got another garden in my backyard that i 've tried to regrow again as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well i 've got chickens to um help me with that as well uw currently i 've got a small garden in my backyard and i 'm working really hard on it using all these new things i 've learned on it and right now i 'm trying to recycle more the things i 'm planning to do at home is we 've always had a patch of buffer grass at the back of our house and um it 's always been a nuisance because we put poison on but then it 's dropped all its seeds and then it 'll grow again so i 'm planning now to fully eradicate the buffle grass and um yeah try not to use poison because there 's also other native plants amongst the waffle grass well i 've made a lot of beeswax wraps from the last workshop we did and yeah um yeah i 've started building my own wicking bed which has been fun i 've been doing that with my sister who also did the workshops and finding things from we 've been i 've been going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the wicking beds yeah was because we 're reusing things which was really good what um help from the workshops i 'm able to make more conscious decisions and understand about composting and how food waste can be repurposed i think it 's important for young people like us to get involved because we 're sort of the next generation of people who can help this earth and um we sort of need to know all about what we 're doing what we 're up against and how we can help um yeah i think it 's really important to also foster leadership within our youth and yeah really teach them life lessons and how they can be good leaders not only for everyone else but also for the planet and how they can promote sustainability and help to reverse the effects of climate change when we 're older we know we know how to protect our environment yeah and we 're going to be like the next generation that needs to pass this on and so now that we have the knowledges we can use it and share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah yeah basically what she said from what i saw the kids actually learned a lot of skills that i even picked up a few myself that i hadn 't even known before part of the printing component of it so i think the kids would have an opportunity to develop their understanding about the environment as well as using those skills when they grow up a bit more i 'd like to learn a bit more about how to save water especially because we live in a desert and that would just be really interesting to just like know a bit more about how to save water i think it would be really interesting if we visited local places for example the solar farm out near the airport and the tip shop and learn how they all work um i think i 'd like to learn more about recycling especially in terms of plastic how to read the little numbers that are on them and how to tell if a product is made from recycled ingredients and i 'd also like to learn what action to take to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really interested in attending a workshop focused around renewable energy and mainly solar power specifically with solar panels because we have so much sun here it 'd be really interesting how we can further implement that to generate renewable energy and in a sustainable way locally um i would like to do one about bush medicines because like expressing outer springs a lot of culture and stuff we 've got lots of community community stuff we might as well utilize that because we 've got so much knowledge here so we get to do um like bush medicines like because i know they do things out of what 's called the desert desert park they do that i 've been there before i do tons of bushmen things where they teach us and stuff like that it 's maybe like an extended course where you learn about all different kinds of kinds of medicines and the plants that are made through yeah i was thinking something about luck a lesson of traditional owners about native floor and fauna because i think that would be really interesting i really liked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i just really liked that theme and i thought to appeal to youth as well be really fun and interactive and look like you really wanted to get involved [Music] [Applause] you,"(-23.7404675, 133.8482142)"

I found out that this old man that I know that when he was young he he went on tour with the Houmas burg choir and he went to all these little outback New South Wales towns and one of them was gun to God where my father 's father is from yeah that really excited me to know that this old man on you in Holmesburg had been through this little town when my grandfather was from and yeah it inspired me to go home and start writing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actually I got so excited about it that the next time I I went out there to see him I took him all this really useless Gundagai memorabilia like going to mental tea towels and and things like that and it was hard to that 's nobody thought of all that really anyway it 's a song about my grandfather from going to go [Music] my father 's father come from down a winding track near the dog a pony stuck a box where that black fella saved all them blokes in his for this trade was Cup and dreaming boxes for the dead [Music] I think World

the corner he ended up with a job working for the state bank those were the days before some politicians sold it off and he would stay back late at night and trying to sign off lumps so humble Brisbane folk could on their own [Music] no he 's long gone I feel him stronger than before and I hold dear burr and times I can recall [Music] like playing lawn bowls in his home I used to love when he called me Deadeye dick the back pain got to him I like the cancer in his blood I plan to go back there but he died before I could I feel to know more of him is enough to make me sick there 's no going back there 's no going back [Music] no going back so there 's no point [Music] all right thank you thanks for listening I gotta get a couple more for you [Music] the sun 's going down I 'll stay up and sing to that spirit the troubles me to say when I need will take more than one night he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with disbelief his wings were clipped by my spiteful hands [Music] and in my wake he went tumbling [Music] my disciple he follow me anywhere and I took him to all the places I showed him things that he would never have seen but I got him hug and smashed in teeth where a sentence wrought by me he ended up sick but never sick of me and all the while he 's sinking while I 'm sorry [Music] it is my pain I try to sing away I 've kept it buried right up till this day with creeps in at night it hides in plain sight the sun 's coming up I better get to bed before the new day finds me but I can 't sleep yeah with my eyes shut cuz I won 't see him no I won 't see him if he comes to

about a woman who finds out she 's pregnant and has to sort of sort through our love life before the baby gets there beautiful show and make it work make it clever making it sweet crimp the edges or

love with about a year ago called Hades town it 's written by a nice Mitchell and it looks at the two great myths of Eurydice in Orpheus and Persephone and Hades and how they intersect at a certain point in the illogical scheme of things it 's a very bittersweet love story and it has some incredible musical music in it and this is one of the songs that ridda C sings in act 2 when she realizes what a mistake she was falsely close my eyes and disappear like a pebble monastry feminine [Music] I troubled when he laid me out you won 't feel a thing me said nothing [Music] dreams are sweet until

music for Malaya but before he did all of that he wrote a little show called in the heights which follows a largely Dominican American community who live in Washington Heights and their struggles day to day as they try live life to the fullest it 's a beautiful show and this song is sung by one of the lead characters as beginning of the show as she struggles with the fact that she doesn 't fit into her college community that she thought she would [Music] this is my street smile that faces I 've known all my life they regard you with pride and everyone sweet they say you 're going places so

from ten-year-old mai maranti comes an uplifting and heartfelt story about how to stay happy when our sun doesn 't shine hello everyone i am rachel dukak i was the young territory author award winner of 2020. when preparing for this contest i spent months reading classic books trying to develop my writing style and of course spent tireless hours trying to complete my book before the deadline i never expected i would win but this contest was easily one of the best things that has ever happened to me but if i didn 't take the chance then i would have never gotten this opportunity so remember nothing exciting ever happened to a person who kept all their ideas locked away in their mind this contest is a really good idea to test the waters to see what you have to do to get your idea to the finish line from your mind and onto the page it keeps you motivated and helps you to feel like you 're working towards something we writers hear a lot of people telling us that writing isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technically both those things are true writing isn 't an occupation it 's a lifestyle and sure maybe we can 't write forever but as young offers we have the time and the resources to feel like we can and that 's what we should hold on to but even if you don 't want to be a writer if this was a one-time thing for you this contest will still benefit you it could help you boost your confidence or help you realize what you really want to do in life this contest isn 't only for writers but for young people who want different opportunities and experiences the most important thing that i 've learned this year is that your writing will take you places it might not be a hollywood for a massive movie production or a massive signing with hundreds of people or interviews every weekend but just because you 're not famous doesn 't mean your stories don 't have value it might just mean that they 're meant for something else the farthest you go as an author might only be reading your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've created going off to different countries to read to people in sad situations to bring hope back into their lives or even simply going to your local library every weekend to read to the kids there whose parents have dropped them off so that they could go food shopping any way you put it one way or another your stories can impact people and make their days that much brighter so i 'm not going to stop and neither should you no matter how many people tell me that i can 't do it no matter how many obstacles are in my way i 'll keep writing because that 's what it means to persevere what it means to be a writer if you entered this competition and you win then i congratulate you but if this is let 's say your fourth time and you still haven 't won don 't take that as a defeat take it as an opportunity to try harder next year and if this is let 's say your last year then keep writing enter more competitions maybe even go for publishing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't try so as i sign off i 'll tell you the things that this contest has taught me and that is to never give up to know that no matter how long you are a writer you can always improve to know that your stories can change lives and finally writer 's block isn 't a thing honestly you can push past it pick up your laptop pick up your notebook and just write and now the moment we 've all been waiting for the young territory author award winner for 2021 overall winner is rowan mcgarth for their book a frozen flame a frozen flame exiled and alone corrine is cast into a trouble when cassandra drops into his life together they must flee and race discover who and what they are judges agreed that rowan is a natural writer with a sophisticated turn of phrase and an ability far beyond his years to conjure images in the reader 's mind many sentence constructions in the story are beautiful evocative and linger long in the mind and a huge congratulations to ronald mcgarth for a frozen flame for the 2021 young territory author awards overall winner,"(-12.4081003, 130.8980767)"

show our appreciation thank you so much [Applause] i have spotted my favorite chocolates in there as well so um see how nice if they are going to share some with me only the best for our hard work is

this present was very unexpected um we 'd like to welcome everyone and and thank you for the beautiful lara kia welcome earlier and we 're so glad that uh the lord mayor can be here and all the city of darwin people they work really hard on this and the judges we were just so impressed with all all the work that we saw it was a mammoth job and it was a really difficult decision because we saw so much beautiful creativity and imagination in words and in in illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels that you thought oh you could put that on a bookshelf and buy that they would look so professional it was a really difficult decision um but we had so much fun reading them all and so all the people here today feel really proud of yourself it 's sad that we could only pick one winner for all the categories we would have loved to pick more winners so if you are a finalist i 'll be really proud of yourself keep going keep persevering because that 's what we 're going to hear from some of the past winners i think and they 've had to keep persevering and they 've had some successes as a result so i think we 're really lucky we 've got rosario martinez running these awards this year she 's really passionate about children 's writing as are all the library staff and the council staff and it 's really impressive that there 's been 30 years of this award and i think it 's a really important award to encourage young people to explore the explore writing explore drawing explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it the judges also want to thank the teachers who get behind this because it 's international teachers day and we know a lot of teachers put a lot of effort into this competition as well and the parents as well because i know there 's a lot of parents out there who are encouraging their kids to enter and encouraging them to be creative and read books and write books and the young territory author awards wouldn 't be anything without all you people involved so the judges want to say keep up the good work it 's a shame we have to pick winners but it means we can have this lovely ceremony here and thanks again for the beautiful basket of goodies [Applause] thank you sally and of course thank you to all of our judges for the time and effort um you 've put in for choosing these books today excellent and now it is time to begin our presentation of the awards so

another special message about her journey through the anterior author awards hello my name is sasha beekman and i won the 16 to 18 year old category of the young territory author awards when i was 16 and 17 in 2012 and 2013. and i just wanted to say a very big happy 30th birthday to the young territory author awards 30 is a huge milestone and i really wanted to say how grateful i am to these awards and the impact it has had on my career because at that age the last one that i won when i was 17 i was sort of deciding what i wanted to do with my future and having a panel of people objective people read your story and think there 's something good in this and we really like this was huge for me and i never really shared my writing far and wide and so the confidence boost that that gave me kind of led me to feel that i really could pursue a career as an author as a writer so that helped me decide that that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uni and i studied a writing course and now i work in publishing actually and i 'm a published author i wrote a picture book called when you 're going to the moon that came out in 2018 um and now i continue to work in publishing um for my full-time job so i again just can 't thank this award enough and it really did mean the world to me to win the categories that i did um and a very big thank you again [Applause] excellent and a great thank you to sasha as well for her kind words and very excited for the next set of awards okay we are up to the 13 to 15 year old age group so we 'll call out the shortlisted winners first and we 'll have our

author award winner penny hart here penny is going to make a speech for your can you please make her feel very welcome penny hart [Applause] thanks penny welcome welcome good afternoon everyone it 's an honor to speak as a past winner of the young territory author awards today i remember being involved with the awards from a really young age running around inside casuarina library which i probably shouldn 't have been doing all dressed up so i could receive my award it was always a really happy place with the tall shelves there all those books and so many wonderful librarians who really contributed to my love of reading and writing my stories were called things like tricky causes trouble which was about a magic forest in a very naughty goblin undead warrior where two boys were play acting as the lord of the underworld and a magical warrior a scholar healer and guardian which was a longer tale that was set in a world of desert tribes fancy castles and more magic so you may be sensing a theme here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never stop dreaming of far away lands i won the award in 2001 with dragon blood which was about young people and arranged marriage and dragons i was a joint winner the following year in 2002 with amanda deacon with my book titled zakranzi which was even more magical than the ones before i 've also been privileged to be involved in the awards since as a judge and reading hundreds of books and stories from young people like you was just a joy especially the ones from far across the territory although as the judges will know picking a winner was also a really hard gig being a writer helped me at high school at university and continues to help me in every job that i 've had and the young territory author awards also really well recognised particularly in the northern territory so it 's been something that 's been a tick on my resume when i 've gone to apply for jobs i now work in hansard at parliament house and that 's where we write down all the words and decisions that help shape the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic would someday lead me here to all the young people who participated this year congratulations and i encourage you to please keep writing because we need your stories thank you [Applause] thank you so much penny we 've got a little gift for you thank you and please give it up again for penny hart how inspiring are these words today i actually want to go and write a book now all right well to round out our age category winners tonight we 're going to start on our 16 to 18 year old authors so for our

before we get into the rest of the awards for the night uh i 'd like to join me as i invite to the uppai puri torres strait islander group to the stage for a special performance this evening give a round of applause good afternoon everybody i 'm not too sure if you 're going to be able to hear me so my name is natalie i was born here in darwin and congratulations to all of you who won today that is very impressive don 't give up on your beautiful little dreams okay we use stories to pass on a lot of our knowledge about our culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there 's a great little story about greedy gubba who was this guy who was a bit greedy he was supposed to be sharing foods between different groups on an island and it 's one of the stories we love to tell so the parents used to tell their children if you get greedy you 're going to end up like greedy gubbar so he he was naughty and they ended up tying him up in the middle of the island because he was sneaking all the good stuff and giving all the dodgy food to everybody else so he got into really big trouble keep those dreams alive and keep telling your stories it doesn 't matter what other people think of your stories just keep telling your stories we 're going to do a couple of dances for you guys today so i 'm not going to read you a story we 're going to share some of our dances with you so i 'm going to bring out my beautiful family so i 've got my mum with me today and two of my daughters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just in case you 've been sitting there for a really long time there 's going to be a dance that you all get to join in and you don 't have to leave your chair you can stay in your chair okay i 'm just going to bring out my beautiful little family tommy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me some of the dances we do standing up some we do sitting down so that first one we just did is a little play dance and we use that to teach the little people left right up down fast slow things like that left hand right foot all that sort of stuff so we like to trick them a little bit by doing like the opposite hand and opposite foot and they 're like but why because it 's just how it is so we 're going to do a couple of sit-down dances for you the first one is about fishing with your mum so if anybody has heard of or seen christine anu do tabanaba with the wiggles that 's like the part one so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that and this one 's called peyama and it 's a cute little one that i love doing with these with these little ones all right before i continue we have little miss ruby on the end there she often growls me for not introducing them so we 've got little miss ruby down there and they give him a quick way of ruby she 's eight years old we have siobhan in the middle and siobhan is ten little ways and then we have my beautiful 21 year old mother we just call her nene which means grandmother at your knees and rock your bodies from side to side up left left left right left right left right [Music] left [Music] hey [Music] [Music] hey [Music] so the next one we 're going to do is the one where you get to join in so this one 's called sasa and sasa is basically about showing off so the story goes with this one uh it 's like a day at the beach when you 're single and you see somebody come out of the water and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody really interesting and you just want to be their friend but you want them to know a little bit about yourself so basically it 's we pat our knees three times and we dive to the left and we pat our knees three times we dive to the right because we want them to notice us then we do it again and we dive to the front then we come up out of the water sorry tap three times come up out of the water and then we go one two three clap one two three roll your hands and pose now with the pose everybody can do different poses some people like to flex but you know you 're gonna have like muscles to do that bit um yeah i see some flexing out there good work some people just like to look cute all right you can do this one too little ladies um some of us like like people to know that we like reading so we can do this and pretend we 're reading a book or we 're writing a book or we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like at the end so basically at the start i 'll ask you all to pat your knees like i did for these guys and to rock your bodies from side to side and we 'll do that all together and then i will ask what the magic word is and this bit 's really important so when i say what 's the magic word normally you would say please but we say sasa so everybody has to say sasa and don 't worry if you deafen us that 's okay i 'm can 't hear anything anyways so we 're to go patting our knees rocking our bodies from side to side i 'm going to say what 's the magic word and we 'll say sasa so let 's just quickly practice that bit what 's the magic word beautiful then we go one two three and dive one two three and dive one two three and dive one two three and come out of the water and one two three clap one two three roll your hands and pose if my son would hear he would die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we do it to him on purpose because that 's what siblings and mummies do we do it three times we normally go faster and faster but today i think we 're just going to keep it in an even pace we might get just a smidge bit faster but not too much so we 're going to pat our knees in time with the drum and rock our bodies from side to side [Applause] up left left left right left right left right left what 's the magic word up one two three to the side one two three to the other side one two three to the front one two three up high one two three clap one two three roll your hands and pose oh i see some beautiful posing and a dab i see a dab thank you little fella you 're a champ all right let 's go again pat your knees and rock your bodies from side to side up left left left right left right left right left what 's the magic word tip one two three to the left one two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one two three up high one two three tap one two three roll your hands and pose beautiful posing out there i love that side that looks awesome all right let 's go one more time touch your knees and wrap your bodies from side to side up left left left right left right left right left what 's the magic word one two three to the side one two three to the other side one two three to the front one two three up high one two three clap one two three roll your hands and pose beautiful work give yourselves a big round of applause that was amazing get you all moving get the blood pumping in the legs because sometimes if you sit down for too long things go to sleep and then it 's hard to walk so you 're saying over there ruby you 're doing one with ninny no no so apparently my daughters have had a really big day um because they had a halloween disco at school and so we had a vampire and a witch and i had to like clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might have scared some little people so one 's resting because she 's old and the other one is eager to continue so we 're going to do another one for you this one 's called oli mali and it 's another little play one that we like to do with kids so a lot of our dances are pretty simple pretty basic and very repetitive and the reason we do that is because when you first start learning something you have to do it over and over and over again so for all you little good readers out there a good hint would be to invest in a dictionary and read read read read read the more words you have the more descriptive you can be with your work and the easier it is for somebody to go away to that beautiful little place you 're describing in your stories dictionaries are a key but this isn 't about dictionary [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] a [Music] my [Music] [Applause] a [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yay [Music] sorry people yes please sometimes mummy talks so much that she loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit we 're going to do one more for you guys today for you all i should say while i wait for my water um and i love this one because i don 't have to sing that 's mine children nothing is sacred nothing at all not even the toilet and just so you know children sometimes when your parents say i really need to go to the toilet it 's because we 're trying to hide not all the time okay like genuinely we do need to go to the toilet sometimes but yeah it 's it 's a good little um thing when your parents are in the toilet don 't come to them with random things like knocking on the door going can i please have a milo that could have waited five minutes while i was finished peeing so um my children are notorious for doing this to me we 're going to do one more for you this one 's called murrak and it 's a rhythmic dance that 's why i like it so much so i don 't have to sing normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have other children with us uh but yeah one 's working and others have just finished school and it 's been a big week in a big couple of weeks for some of us are you okay so this one 's called murak it 's a rhythmic dance this one 's from uh saibai which is sort of closer to papua new guinea on this island i wish i could describe it in his beautiful words as you guys probably put together but on this island if you 're standing on the edge facing papua new guinea and the tide is low enough you can walk there it 's that close to papua new guinea but it 's still in australia which tells me that we might as well just keep popping you 're getting for us if it 's that close like if i can walk there i might as well just you might just claim it but we do a lot of training with papua new guinea so some of our some of our outfits like and even some of our instruments that we use we trade with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cul-ups back in the day uh sailors would use these to make match boxes so we have match boxes today that are cardboard with a little flinty thing down the side that you can strike the match on sailors would use these so they 'll cut them in half take the white stuff out put the matches in the middle put it back together seal it with wax if their boat ever sank and they needed to start a fire they would just crack it open take out one of the matches and strike it on this beautiful seed the seeds themselves come from these massive seed pods in queensland up in coriander up in the tablelands so up in the rain forest up there the seed pods grow on these beautiful big trees the rains come knock the seed pods down they pop open and then all of these beautiful seeds get washed out to the ocean the ocean cleans it up for us brings it back to the beach we go down collect them all soak them for a little while so they 're nice and soft cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole in it on some rope and then tara we 've got these beautiful little instruments and so these ones are pull-ups and this beautiful thing here is called a thrump traditionally it would just have a rectangle cut out the front and maybe another one at the back but my cousin came to me a few years ago and said i saw one with just three circles imagine the possibilities and i went i already am and so now we 've got like this beautiful one with the dugong we 've got a crocodile one we 've got a conch shell we 've got all sorts of turtle and everything but ruby 's going to join me for this one because she 's amazing and super energetic and is drinking my water again you 're lucky you 're my child come on darling see even the baby agreed you shouldn 't be drinking my water on that side so this one 's murica and i hope you enjoy it did you want to set the pace ah i thought i turned it off oh ah hey ruby look you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you all very much we are oppai puri we hope you enjoyed and got your blood pumping a little bit and enjoy the rest of your evening and your weekend [Applause] awesome thank you very much guys for that very enthusiastic performance wonderful all right now before we get into our next set of awards just a quick reminder to everyone uh if you have won any of the awards tonight whether it be the encouragement highly committed or the overall winner make sure you stay to the end and come and join us and we 'll get an overall winners group photo so stick around okay now presenting the young territory author awards school winners we would like to invite kim menzies from channel 7 to present the awards thank you kim now this year there are two winners so due to cover 19 restrictions we will only be inviting one school at a time to come up to the stage now each school will have their name engraved on the perpetual trophy and will receive one that they get to take back to their school with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is juan gorey primary school for debrina year one and two so for the balancing act up you come so they 're at the back they 're gonna come up to receive their award now um apparently i have not read the book yet but it is a beautiful um story that really captures life in the northern territory so i 'm excited to read that one well done and we 'll just get a photo with um the whole group before you sit down and they want to touch it all right and then we 'll gather around the front photo don 't go any further that 's good well done thank you so much you can take your seats we 'll keep the big one because we 'll let the next school also have a little photo with it oh sorry [Laughter] there we go okay now our second winner of the school award goes to stewart park primary school gorman year three for their book words of wonder again well done to the students and teachers involved in creating these beautiful anthologies that capture life in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good who 's going to hold it the choices well done can we give him a round of applause and coming at your group photo [Applause] well done we 'll take the big one back again because we 'll keep that big one at the library indeed thank you very much please give them a round of applause stuart primary school gorman year 3. and please give a big thank you to kim menzies from channel 7 for awarding that award to the schools thank you [Applause] all right so next up we will be doing our regional award winners but before we announce those winners i 'd like to invite our three-time palmerston regional award winner and published author sean guy to come up and give his speech and thoughts on the uncharted author awards come on up sean hello everyone good afternoon well done to all the young authors and thank you as well to the parents teachers librarians and esteemed guests who made this all possible i 'm sorry the rest of the bookshop staff couldn 't be here but i heard there was chocolate so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy and i 'm the manager of the bookshop down in smith street and it is an honor to be here for the 30th anniversary of the young territory author awards at first when i saw the balloons i didn 't realize it was the 30th anniversary so i thought maybe they were for my birthday but that doesn 't make sense because i 'm turning 27 and my birthday 's in february but i just assumed some of you might remember me from last year when i was one of the young the judges of the young author awards i didn 't get to judge again this year which is a shame because it was a really good fun opportunity but i somehow conned my way into coming up here and delivering a speech again so that 's good what 's mostly good delivering a speech at the young author awards can be a little bit bittersweet for me because usually uh well sometimes when i walk into a room people say oh that 's sean guy he 's such a talented young writer but not in this room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because all of you are talented young writers and it 's very rude that you 've taken that away from me it makes me extremely jealous because not only are you all so talented but you 're so much younger than me that you make me look old by my age you 'll probably have a dozen books whereas me i 'm almost 30 and i 've got three books and no children whereas i suspect my mum would like it to be the other way around so the reason i was invited here today is because i won the palmerston regional award for the young authors three times in a row when i was your age about 100 years ago and it was an experience that changed my life i 've since gone on to work in my dream job and published three novels which you can read when you 're older and i 'm also writing a feature film the reason i say this is not to brag although i do like bragging but the reason i say this is because the young author awards was a keystone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and megan and sasha have said winning the palmerston regional awards three times in a row and having my work recognized by impartial judges just changed my life forever and set me on a path that has been so incredible over the last um 10 years 10 11 years i think i 'm not sure it 's a long time ago what the libraries do for our community and for our youth is incredible and i think we need to be remembering that all year round not just at the fancy awards ceremonies so i have two main messages and i 'll try and do them quite quickly my first message is for the kids in the room kids authors you can do anything you 've written a book now which is on everybody 's bucket list but you 've done it before you 've finished high school so you 've got a long time left to climb mount everest and go bungee jumping and do all those other things that are normally on bucket lists when you go home i want you to start getting ready for your next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do to be creative go and do it you 're the artist of our future in 20 years time it 'll be your movies on netflix it 'll be your books on my bookshelf and your art on my walls and i 'm planning to retire in about 10 years so i need those to be good movies and good books this year with covert has proven that sometimes when we get stuck in lockdown or even just all through the year we rely on art to get us through it 's those creative people who make it worthwhile you know on our friday nights and our sat days and our weekends you know it 's your art that gets us through so please keep at it and i give i wish you all the best in the future my second message is to the parents and guardians in the room please keep encouraging your kids you 're doing a great job and you have amazing talented young kids who have created these beautiful books so please keep giving them those opportunities let them wander through the libraries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three pages of anything they can pick up or the last three pages if they 're weirdos keep making use of these amazing facilities i 'm the bookshop manager so i have to say it but i do think it 's true let them read anything they want you know it 's not always about learning something from a book it 's just about

Australia",2251,"[Music] reduce reuse recycle heard that line before recycling and reducing the amount of waste which has to be buried in the ground as landfill should be one of the most important tasks that we do each day we have an amazing natural environment and it 's up to us to keep it that way for future generations let 's find out more about the services are down which help to make recycling easy for all of us why is recycling such a big deal I hear you ask well recycling matters let me break it down for you this is a garbage truck and it can carry about six tons of compacted or squish rubbish that 's a lot of waste in the Darwin region we throw away about 30,000 garbage trucks full of compacted waste each year so now you can start to see why recycling is so important if we don 't start recycling more we may end up with more rubbish than we have land to bury it in did you know the average Ozzie family of four typically throws away enough rubbish each year that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling now for the good news fact yes it 's true recycling is taking place right here in Darwin so let 's learn more about some of the recycling services which are available and how you can be the ultimate recycler without even raising a sweat how you been it will make the difference between whether your waste can be sorted for reuse and recycling or end up going to landfill by reducing reusing and recycling more you can help hit what needlessly goes to landfill to a minimum so let 's manage our waste for a greener future and help make Darwin a cleaner and a more sustainable City for future generations the city of Durham provides two main services for the down region firstly your yellow top recycling bin which is collected from your home and secondly there 's a shoal bay waste management facility here you 'll find more recycling options as well as the recycle shop and the show bay mulch they even make electricity at show Bay more on that later in the meantime let 's have a closer look at exactly how these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility otherwise notice a mess check it all is recycling what you put in your yellow top bit at home is collected from your curbside and brought here to the MuRF blech from the yellow top bins and empty the full load out for sorting into the right groups different recyclables are processed and they used to make different things so the most important part of the recycling process is to separate each item type it goes without saying that a steel can can 't be reused to make paper so there 's no point sending the steel can to the paper making factory let 's stop the tool for a minute so we can look at what the different recyclable types are the main types of recyclables are paper cardboard all types of plastic containers are new mininum and steel cans glass bottles and jars on the subject of papermaking did you know that after 60% less energy is needed to make recycled paper then paper made from virgin pulp that 's mashed up tree okay let 's get back to the separation process how do they get all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's awesome how this happens check it out the recyclables go into a big spitting sin for the trouble small non paper things such as broken glass and other bits fall through the holes and land in bins the larger non paper items land on a bouncing conveyor belt paper and cardboard go all the way through the trommel onto another conveyor belt unfortunately it doesn 't always work out perfectly and while the machines are great there are still mixed recyclables and contaminants ending up on the conveyor belts this is why there are three sorting stations along the conveyor belt which is where recyclables are hand sorted to make sure glass is good blood cardboard and paper together and plastics go to the right place and so on it is so important not to mix up the recyclables anything that can 't be recycled at this stage is known as contaminant contaminants include items such as green waste and food scraps nappies and plastic bags all contaminants are put into a general waste bin and sent to landfill did you know that plastic bags and everything tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so even if a plastic bag is full of great recyclables the plastic bag is taken off the belt and put into the general waste bin and then sent to landfill as it can 't be opened for health and safety reasons not cool right the sorting station people need our help to spread the word don 't put plastic bags in the yellow top bin now where were we ah yes the sorting stations what 's left continues on to the second and third sorting station which concentrates on taking any leftover glass cardboard or plastic items off the belt and into separate product containers there is also a giant magnet which helps up by repelling all steel cans off the belt and into big cages at the end of all is sorting the paper cardboard plastic steel and aluminium are bowed up and sent for reprocessing into things like recycled paper plastic bottles or new aluminium and steel cans remember the materials recovery facility sorts out what we put into the yellow top bins they want heaps of recyclables not here to the general waste you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure we only put items into the yellow top bins which can be sorted for recycling at the move which means no green waste no food scraps or liquids and definitely no plastic bags did you know that places like child care centers and preschools love reusing materials for crafts we may even do this in your own class I bet with you to have made the most amazing creations and plastic lives of small boxes and chips have you ever tried making things with old CDs and DVDs amazing someone 's trash is a young kids treasure think about collecting a few bagful to donate to your local child care centers or preschool what check with your teacher to see if you can bring recyclables along for your classes art attire okay here we go back to what we put into our yellow top bins all plastic containers after they 've been rinsed out and their lids have been taken off cardboard magazines junk mail and paper steel and aluminium cans rinse first and aerosols lids off first glass bottles and jars you know it rinsed if needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what let 's see how we go about getting it right in our own home you 'll find recyclables at all rooms in your home not just in the kitchen see nothing to it something to remember though everything must be thrown into the bin loose not one plastic bag in sight you can even go one step further we 're reducing your household waste why not set up a composting bin or a word of time in your own backyard to make fertilizer out of your food scraps let 's recap these are the recyclables that go in the yellow top in nothing else no green waste no food scraps all liquids and definitely no plastic bags awesome stuff happening there with a yellow top bins but the war against waste doesn 't stop there my friends have you ever been to the shoal bay waste management facility you may have been out there with a trailer full of palm fronds or other ways from the garden this place is critical for recycling in Darwin there is so much going on they sure are working hard to reduce reuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoal bay is to stop off at the recycling shop before you head to the Weybridge you can drop off a whole stack of extra things for recycling that you can 't put in your yellow top bin why scrap metal white goods TVs old computers and screens car batteries plastic bags even old furniture you don 't need anymore just like with the yellow top bins everything is easier when we sort out our recyclables before we 've been them well it 's the same at shoal bay sort out your load at home before you make the trip put your green waste at the bottom and place recyclables on the top of the green waste so you can drop them off at the recycle shop before you take your palm fronds over the Weybridge for mulch you can then take any non recyclable items to the transfer station and put them into the Skip bins to be taken for landfill get this did you know up to 90 percent of a computers component part can be recycled and between 80 to 90 percent of white goods can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recycled gases in the unit 's used for cooling need to be removed as they are very harmful to the environment this degassing process takes place at Shell Bay one more good reason to make sure that you do the right thing and bring your white goods into the recycle shop and not to landfill you can also recycle your household goods here good to know if you have filled up your yellow top bed at home best of all heaps of things are available for us to buy at the recycle shop and bargain prices and reuse at home so remember stop here at the recycle shop first check this place out what a range such variety spare bike parts anyone even though we are keen and active recyclers the fact is that contaminated recyclables and other journal way still exists and still needs to be buried as landfill but shoal bait that 's not the end of the story oh no recyclers it 's not that 's because even after the waste is buried the methane gas that is produced naturally and decomposing rubbish is captured and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the power supply that comes into our houses but how does that all happen well let 's start at the beginning Shoal Bay has three landfill areas the waste deposited by the garbage trucks is compressed using a large piece of machinery called a compactor throughout the area big pipes notice wells as deep into the landfill way underground in the landfill the waste materials and decomposing and breaking down a process which produces a gas called methane you have Cohen have a giggle you 've heard of me thank gas before haven 't you all living things including cows also produced me thank back to being serious these wells connect to a pipe that suck the methane gas over to this big machine called a power module this is where the gas is converted into electricity see that box up on the power pole that 's what feeds the electricity back into the power lines which come to our houses did you know that around 1800 down houses are powered from the electricity made from the landfill methane gas at shallow bay how cool is that so even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can make use of it oh and you know those palm fronds and other garden wastes you drop off on the weekend that stuff is called green waste and it has turned into the different types of box that is just a magic for our gardeners just to make sure there is no strain metal or plastic bags in your green waste as these can do serious damage to the machinery it 's fantastic what 's happening here with recycling right here and down and it all starts with what we do at home you can see how easy it is us to play a part in the recycling process just by thinking about how your waste can be reused or recycled just a quick reminder of what can go into the yellow top bin paper cardboard all types of plastic containers aluminium and steel cans glass bottles and jars there are so many ways to reduce reuse and recycle and in this film we have covered the main services provided by the city of Darwin but there are many other ways for you to recycle more here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city adown

us that young people were looking for more opportunities to access free nighttime and after-hours programs and activities to meet their sporting artistic creative cultural and social needs a common thread to these issues was the absence of nighttime and weekend programs that are free accessible and youth friendly young people also said they were looking for more authentic professional development opportunities to stay in Darwin and work rather than having to leave to pursue opportunities elsewhere they told us that young people are concerned with mental health and issues such as

the 80s that 's a lot of pink my folks grew up in the 80s and from what I 've heard it was a really bizarre time hmm do you recognize anything in this picture there 's a like weird glasses hmm and that but that 's too big to be a fireman that can 't be a fire in the 80s if you wanted to look cool you put your hair in a machine that turned it into a fuzzy jumble of crazy zigzags who had zigzag hair good bat head do you want your head up like crazy zigzags oh look there 's the machine the window zigzag trick and I call that the zig zag machine in the 80s mum said you 'd record your favorite music on cassette tapes the tape was always unraveling so you 'd have to get a pencil to winder all the way back in do you know what a cassette tape is you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's a cassette and that 's a pencil surely that 's a pencil but what 's all this stuff I think that 's tape and that goes inside there the music is stuck on the tape how do you get music off tape and get this you 'd put a hip-hop cassette in a boombox lay down some cardboard and spit on your head that guy 's spinnin now I have to confess I spied on my head on cardboard antenna creep some people like music from a boombox machine so I can 't confirm this whole story used true I think the cassette tape goes in there I think that 's how you get the music off the tape in the 80s a telephone was this big heavy thing that never left the house if you couldn 't remember your friends number you look it up in this massive book everyone 's number was in there that 's a big phone and that 's a big book look at that the phone had a cord and she 's wrapped herself in the cord and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I think it fits into your mummys pocket and you play want to look at it a lot and you 'll find us games I wouldn 't be surprised and plays videos our phones never do that for exercise people would put on super tight fluoro cords and dance about with these fluffy things around their ankles I never wore fluffy things around my ankles you have to ask your mum and dad if they ever good to fly and do they have it own clothes like this well I reckon dancing you 've just been dancing I can dancing is a good way to exercise you 'll be running around the yard running around the lounge room watching this so I think you 'll find that gets me the sweat up that 's a good way to exercise kids in the 80s would attach little plastic balls to the wheels of their bikes which would then click and clack as they rode but no one can tell me why maybe to make the noise I don 't know somebody your mom and dad your grandparents would know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bike to back click-clack click-clack and if you wanted to watch a particular movie at home you 'd have to go to the video library and Renton we 're in a library now full of books so there 's a library like this but full of ddos Wow then you 'd have to go back the next day to return it if you forgot to rewind your video tape you gained up big trouble you don 't do that now a home on the streaming on our TV a bit of Netflix Netflix and yeah or you go and watch this yeah on Facebook this is much better than the video library in the 80s a computer was a big beige box with a tiny green screen no one had the internet yet so computers did hardly anything cool at all look at that that 's a big computer Joe that right now the modern-day equivalent of that and then some fits in your pocket we 've come a long way but all these faces all the famous singers rockers and musicians dressed up in really crazy outfits it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I see this every time there 's a face painting around about that 's not so crazy all you kids do that right now at the face painter what 's your favorite thing when you go the face painter is it spider-man when Superman is it princess or fairy and dad says while the most popular tingled TV was this kooky show men and women would be introduced then a robot would tell what they shall get married I don 't know if that 's that crazy I can computers through some things nowadays look at that that 's a sharp suit don 't see too many suits up here mmm look at the look at that robot would you like to have a robot at home you probably won 't believe this but back in the 80s everyone used to wear these t-shirts that would change color with the temperature that kind of just made people look sweaty you women would wear jackets were built in ginormous pointy shoulders I told you everything was bizarre look at that that 's some crazy shoulders if you said something was @ @

bare with me kids but I do this often he 's here today to prove rugby league players can read in 1 minute silence you can imagine the groaning in your guts as the on bark powers of the Australian boats bumped in the stony shore of Gallipoli on the 25th of April 1915 when 12,000 wild colonial boys dashed across the Shivering Turkish sand in the pale light of a dairy farmers dawn last we 're flying lit but you can imagine in one minute silence lines of young Turkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder in trenches cut light wounds firing on the strangers wading through the shallows intent on streaming into the homeland of the Turkish people in one minute 's silence you can imagine the boys from the back of beyond and the blokes from the Big Smoke married scrambling up the steepest of Turkish slopes making tracks and marking maps with skidding boots and bursts of blood as a blast and bayonetted their way through the scrub but can you imagine in one minute silence how the Turks finding for their land and their lives thought when they saw the enemy battleships anchored in the bay slouch hatchets strangers swarming towards them with rifles I knew that this was going to be a fight to the death it 's a really nice picture there of a bullet flying through the air in one minute of silence you can imagine the bare knuckled Bushmen of the Australian Lighthorse ten seconds away from running at the Turkish music machine guns turning to each other to say see you later mate then going to then going like mad until just about each other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine in one minute silence when it was the Turkish soldiers who charged again and again until the ground was strewn with thousands of dead and dying men and the cries of the wounded in words the Anzac did not know no but understood filled the sky and reached the sea check out the fly masse fly in one minute silence you can imagine the solitary day when these men met without weapons sharing cigarettes and shovels as they buried their dead in the cool Turkish earth and the sound of the wind and waves and quite talking replace the crack ooh and the blast of war as you can see here both Australians and the Turkish burying their dead in the ground next to each other but can you imagine the fierce Anzacs and the fighting Turks quietly returning to their trenches and after the one day of truce then firing at each other that afternoon although they truly knew that the other men were not so much different after all in one minute silence can you imagine what the Turkish fighters felt when they knew they could hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tears of joy and can you imagine in one minute silence the moment when the bloody diggers finally reached the razored heights of glittery where the lone pine grew to see that the hazy Turkish horizon wasn 't impossible to reach as a castle in the clouds and can you imagine in one minute silence as the Turkish fighter stood strong and straight in there freezing trenches that the dream they dreamed of going home circled like a dog that might soon settle in quite an arts in one minute silence you can imagine the Anzacs strengthening their front lines as if to fight through every hour of every day of the bitter Turkish winter yet in secret they were preparing to leave the cliffs and beaches of Gallipoli seven days before Christmas in 1915 but can you imagine in one minute silence as the Turkish fighters looked down from the cliffs that the Anzacs we 're binding their boots in cloth leaving presents and notes and rifles rigged to fire and about and about to make their way down to the sea and the waiting ships in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Anzac left behind and the promises given to never forget the boys who would not wake to the hush footsteps or the whispered farewells but can you imagine in one minute silence when the Turkish soldiers rose that morning to discover the only remained the perfect lack of sound of a war that had ended those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives you are now lying in the soul of a friendly country therefore rest in peace there is no difference between the Johnnies and the the mammoths to us where they lie side by side here in the country of ours you the mothers who sent their sons from faraway countries wipe away your tears your sons are now lying in a bosom and knowing peace after having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well what an interesting book Michael yeah that was yeah really described had terrible World War one was and how terrible Gallipoli was in that and that people have gone over and you know I fought for us and died for us so that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the main reason I think today rot is that we we need to you know remember those people remember the sacrifices that they made for our country so that you know we can enjoy the freedoms and the liberties that we do right now yeah so you know that was yeah that was a good story right it 's sad but you know it 's a very good story next week thanks kids all right so we 're just going to finish off today with the ode and have a man in silence just to reflect on those people who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country do they shall grow not old as we that are left grow old they shall not weary them nor the years condemn and they 're going down on the Sun and in the morning we will remember them lettuce we forget [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you you","(-12.5148324, 130.9687836)"

this is Lulu my dog and guess what she 's 12 years old but she can 't jump she can 't jump up and she can 't jump down so she 's here with me today and I 've lifted her up on the seat to join all of you and to enjoy the story here we go little whiter dogs had jump my dog smudge has got really short legs which makes it very difficult for him to jump especially up in to the back of the car so I tried dressing him up as a famous basketball player to make him feel taller and gave him something to jump at but I don 't think little white dogs can jump smudge needed some help I got some strong springs some rope and wood and made a sponge a magic dog lifter that has a little platform for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up I guess the springs were little too strong now smudge curb jump and is afraid of small spaces I borrowed my brother 's skateboard and made a ramp with the wood from the smudger magic dog lifter then I took smudge to the top of our drive and I let him go now smudge can 't jump he is afraid of small spaces and hates Heights I remember borrowing a book from the library about a man in a circus who shot out of cannons this seemed like a good idea smudge didn 't think so now he can 't jump is afraid of small spaces hates Heights and is scared of loud noises one of my favorite cartoon characters used a catapult to fling himself after a really fast bird this seemed like a good idea I could catapult smudge into the back of the car or maybe the front of the car now smudge can 't jump is afraid of small spaces hates Heights is scared of loud noises and moving at great speed it was time for all the family to put their heads together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mum had an idea we 'd get another car one just the right height for smudge mum thought this was a really good idea so did smudge especially as little white dogs can 't jump isn 't that right Lulu and that 's the end of our first story today I know a song about dogs and you guys ready for a song [Music] me [Music] ngo

@ @ @ found things tricky to do because she didn 't have anyone to help her but that 's how things had always been for Gracie and she didn 't want that to change one day Gracie discovered something on her travels it was an egg but where did it come from and who did it belong to well I don 't want to look after this egg huffed Gracie someone must be coming back for it so she snuggled up beside the egg ready for its owner to return the dusty day quickly turned into a sleepy night it was the next day and nobody had come for the egg Gracie was grumpy I don 't want to look after this egg not now not ever as she grumbled and growled the egg started to roll away [Music] down into the depths of the sea [Music] from then on Gracie tried her very hardest to keep the eggs safe looking after this egg is hard work sigh Gracie things were much easier when I was on my own suddenly with a crack and a crumble the egg began to hatch Gracie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hatched from the egg well you were inside the eggs Gracie said can I call you eight adapting nodded and gave a big quack his had been a busy time for Gracie and the goose was tired egg held up a blanket for her to sleep under this is for me nobody has ever given me anything before smiled Gracie from then on Gracie went on to have adventures with her new friend she had learned that it wasn 't easier doing things alone actually everything was a lot more fun with egg around and that 's the end of the beautiful egg story eggs are breakable and I know a song about an egg are you guys ready for a song Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall all the king 's horses and all the king 's men couldn 't put Humpty together again [Music] Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall all the king 's

nailed a fairytale and cats do not eat mice well fancy that exclaimed the cat I 'll have to spread the word he quickly strode across the road and told dog what he 'd heard dogs stared wide-eyed and then replied that 's such a great idea you mean to say today 's the day the one day in the year [Music] when parakeets bring tiger 's treats and rhino takes the time to niche new mittens for hopeless kittens and sing a nursery rhyme cat cried yes yes and sharks play chess with all the little fishes and old gray moose whose orange juice for everyone that wishes and even mold comes out of his hole to play I spy with goat and chimpanzee makes her booty for ostriches sore throat dog said oh boy what joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear are you aware today is friendly day when Fox 's croon all afternoon to entertain the geese and little birds tweet soothing words of hope and love and peace bear scratched his head and then he said it 's so lovely thought to think that we could ever be as kindly as we ought to think baboons hand out balloons to all the butterflies makes tears of bliss and happiness come pouring from my office but dog said bear are you aware there 's really no such thing as friendly day or any day when wasps and bees don 't sting I must insist it don 't exist it is a lovely lie poor dog poor cat they hated that they both began to cry inside his house the tiny mouse was glad he 'd slipped away he treat the cat but now he set and longed for friendly day meanwhile outside the dog still cried the bear gave him a pet oh do cheer up my dearest pup I have a plan said cat who talked to snail and snake and whale will put the world to rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one fights dog thought of how a friendly cow might help a crocodile how centipedes might do great deeds he smiled a watery smile then arm in arm with old-world charm and so much to be done the three friends strode off down the road towards the Setting Sun look at all the animals there again looking very happy that

googly eyes okay so we 've got that and then at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gonna tape it around our heads and make sure you cut that one out as well and then I 've got a stapler to use to attach

Palmerston, NT, Australia",1492,being a restaurant manager what is something you look for in your employees uh say as you know like in america 's that 's a lot of young people especially like 14 15 16 kids working here so what we looking from the younger people is how they enjoy the work uh when they come to the world so we especially look for something they can able to talk to the people or not nicely uh what kind of work they do at a home like this cleanings and and even they don 't know like some of the tasks like we still can train them up so we just make ourselves like really great training systems uh so it doesn 't matter like what skills you up to at the moment but we believe in the people when we train the people up to that levels i mean it 's a whole range of things but i mean they need to be friendly outgoing eager to work in a team you need to be able to work in a fast-paced environment i really just a good attitude more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm really looking for someone that 's enthusiastic and um wants to come across as pretty reliable realistically we need someone to turn up for those shifts because we need the job done for the customers what is the employment process for a young person so how do they have to go about it again a couple of different ways you can apply online uh you can hand in a resume over the counter fill something in over the counter and sometimes if you know a friend that works here then we just organize anybody like that any of those sort of ways okay so for the application to the mcdonald 's you gotta go online search make us apply uh fill up your details fill up a select this restaurant name and you need to fill up the consent from if you 're under 16 and you 're all set to go the correct process is actually to go to wow careers which is wow careers and apply online through there if there 's no jobs available normally if you 're a junior i 'm happy for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seem keen and enthusiastic i 'll probably give you a go anyway what skills do young people learn when working here that can help them in future careers big one teamwork because we have a lot of staff here and you can 't work on the team you can 't work here at all uh being able to work under pressure is a big one as well um i mean not crazy amounts of pressure but you are it is a fast-paced environment so yeah they learn obviously to work because i 've been outside of work standing up for seven or eight hours straight sometimes can knock someone around they really learn how to do with customers good and bad customer service is probably the best thing you learn from woolworths i think before i started working my first job i was really much of like an individual just trying to do everything myself but working at mac has really helped me with like working as a team um leading people and just working together and getting things done you know excellent before working at macca 's i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i 've been working here for almost a year um my social skills have gone up and i 'm able to talk to people with more confidence so what general advice and encouragement would you give young people looking to get into the workforce um just give it a go give it a crack come in fill in an application form do it online uh we 're generally pretty quick we get back to you within five to seven days sometimes sooner but really just have a go because if you 've got a good attitude and you want to work on the team you 'll more than likely do pretty well and do you have anything you 'd like to say to um young people who are looking to get into a job definitely if you don 't have a job apply to the mcdonald 's right away ask questions learn as much as you can and don 't be afraid to try something you 'll always learn something if you 're not happy ask questions about changing departments or anything like that because you don 't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning out to work and becoming unreliable where you might be in produce but it might be amazing for customer service so we can swap these around as well that 's lots of stuff we can do can you tell me a little bit about what youth works does yep so youth works we work with young people aged 15 to 24 basically mentoring them and coaching them into finding something they want to do for a long term career or going on to further education like university and what other resources and facilities does youth works provide young people yeah so we facilitate many workshops like resume writing workshops mock interview writing workshops we help with things getting like driver 's license so registering with drive safe nt anything that they need to get employment and how do you register with youth works and access the facilities they have here yep so there 's two ways of accessing our service here so the first one is if you are receiving and centrelink income it 's best to check with centrelink to see if you 're eligible for our service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second way is if you 're not receiving an income from centrelink is basically walking through the door filling out an expression of interest form and from there we 'll be able to term if you 're eligible for our service here we have our iheart national academy which is our school-based trainees aboriginal and torres islander high school students completing their surgery and allied health assistance so allied health is basically a broad term that explains 29 different other health professions it 's your audiologist you know your doctor that looks after your teeth your dentist speech pathologists and physiotherapists all your other health professions other than a doctor or nurse i became more confident i made a lot of new friends i got to meet a lot of new other health professions that helped me become more open-minded on what i wanted to be in the future you get to experience all these guest speakers you get a lot of support for school i would definitely recommend the academy to any high school students who are interested in working in the health sector so here in the mca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in high school in year 10 and you 're looking for a pathway in 11 and 12 as a vet course this nc academy is a school-based traineeship what are the main reasons to study at cdu we offer a very good program in a number of different areas here at the palmerston campus everything from a certificate one all the way through to a doctorate or a phd and along the way there are many different things ranging from master 's degrees bachelor degrees diplomas vet certificate fours threes twos and ones you can be an apprentice chef here we offer hospitality training as well we offer butchery we offer tourism programs we 've got a hairdressing salon and we 've also got a beauty salon where students actually get to practice on real life customers the first point of call is our website to have a look at the variety of different courses that we do offer here at palmerston you can apply directly through the university or for some courses you can go through the south australian tertiary administration centre which we call satac which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 12. what advice would you give to young people about the causes follow your passion so if you 're really really passionate about hairdressing follow that if you 're really passionate about culinary arts and cooking follow that if you 're passionate about tourism follow that the reason why i say that is my observation has been over the many years that i 've spent in education those who are following their passion not only do better when they 're studying but they do better out in the workforce [Music] you,"(-12.5148324, 130.9687836)"

need the planet let 's do the right thing we 've had several schools involved all the way from parap to temporary station it 's not wow what a morning we 've had five schools here taking part in the echo schools all the rubbish talk all the environmental chatting uh talking about sustainability and it 's just been an absolutely wonderful morning and it 's been a cooperation between the @ @ @ @ @

more presentations a it was really good the kids understood what we were trying to get across in terms of sustainability to make sure that we don 't waste our resources which are the most valuable things that we have on this planet we need to make sure that we leave resources for the future generations and those coming on behind us every day it was a fantastic event and it really did focus on what is important in our community and that is to keep australia beautiful so it was great to talk to the kids the importance about putting the rubbish in the bin putting it in the right bin about turning off light switches power points appliances when they 're not in use turning off the air con when they were not in use keeping doors and windows closed when the air cons are on you can get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and polite way so look thank you very much for you know for allowing me to come and talk to you today so uh enjoy the rest of your your morning party and uh and and certainly learn a lot from today so congratulations well done thank you so this has been organised for a while and it fits very much with the fact that of palmerston has a sustainability strategy and one of its objectives is to do with community education it 's to do with waste and recycling to do with good quality air and water so today was talking to primary school children but not talking at them talking with them and it was also done with a lot of opportunity for this the students and the staff and i have to say i 've counseled kab and the schools to actually have a bit of disco music so there was and there were prizes to be won for some answers to things so it 's just been an amazing morning a day every day every day every day every day we also talked about respecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

life so we had a good time and i think it was an excellent event when you think about the words in that song it 's true it 's so important to be able to live in harmony when you get to be my age you start to realize how wonderful this planet is when you see all the different cultures from all the different countries around the world and when we have so many different countries and cultures it 's important that we live in harmony and we accept and respect each other very important lots of learning lots of thinking and there was a beautiful moment when even though somebody had one little lolly they just didn 't quite get to the bin with their paper and that was picked up then and talked about but on the floor here we are saying let 's pick up all our rubbish and somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

looking at reducing reducing their waste and feeding the chooks with their scraps their food scraps not having to pay to remove those scraps and bury those scraps so again it was clever thinking outside the box we also had the pirates treasure chest going today it was very interesting we put the challenge out there to the kids and said the treasure chest the pirate tells us it contained something more valuable than gold diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was really good to see some of the answers that they were coming back with like is it air is it trees is it soil they 're very good answers and i was so glad to see that they 're thinking like that and when i asked them was the air trees water and food more important than diamonds and gold and silver and they said yes so it 's good to see that our students are starting to appreciate how important things are particularly the resources of this planet and how important it is to minimize that waste and for everybody to do their bit and make this planet a better place rubbish is that really rubbish is it rubbish what is it kyber look at that what is it plastic cardboard aluminium what are these things they 're resources these

right put your rubbish in the bin and when you do put it in the right bin don 't forget when you 're switching off when you don 't need the appliances switch off your power points turn off your aircons at home all right respect other people and their cultures because this is planet earth we all share it all different colored all different people and don 't forget the animals and all the

had tippery station students come and they did a poster about how difficult it was to live and and to recycle particularly in a remote community and it was great that they could come forward and explain how difficult it was on their patch but they 're trying to do their little bit to minimise their footprint their environmental footprint and impact so thank you very much temporary award

in my memory bank that 's for sure yes certainly well it certainly will and being the inaugural champion you know you 're going to have that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today certainly came I felt at the 14th when you know you were holding a one-shot lead Tim heart was coming hard and you make a sensational birdie there on 14 tell us a little bit about that yeah that was definitely in my mind also the turning point for me audience quite a tough hole and I 've been having a bit of trouble with that hole or a week and hit the green once it was playing into the wind just like every other day and I had 193 meters and I 've decided to single punch for iron in there and I hate it really sweet and ended up finishing about four feet from the hole so pretty good yeah that 's a that 's an extraordinary shot there on 14 as all the members would know 14 is is a difficult hole and any time you walk away with palm sure you picking up one shot on the field butter to make a birdie and in that type of pressure is I guess the reason why you 're standing up here in front of everyone this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that play this week spent hours on the on the range and practicing that is only to hope to be able to perform shots like that when you need to so I mean I 'm absolutely so because I was able to finish him and hold it today so really really grateful now you should be should be very happy with the way that you have played it and like Max year you 're going to head over to a few q schools at the end of the year yeah definitely fortunately from my finish on the order of merit last year on the australasian to Australian of finals or European to school so I 'm just sort of getting ready for that and they 've also got a couple of tournaments to play like the Alfred Daniel and the World Golf James you can join up and just bc so just be getting ready for those ones and hopefully have a big finish to the year i 'm sure everyone in northern territory will be following their NT pga

come and do art with me we started 12 to 14 years ago with a group of four people I now put anything between 30 to 40 people through ever had more than that a week hi I 'm Diana and I 'm lucky enough to be Pam 's neighbor I live next door and I have listened to Pam over the years and I 've watched this group grow and it 's just such a generous person and started with a small group and there 'll be another group of people in another group and they 're all doing lovely creative things and they 're all happy there 's a lot of laughter that comes over my fence and I here and and people all caring about each other saying nice things about the artwork what are you going to do what are you doing today or missed you last week that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pam makes it happen this is the first piece of big art that we did here because I had a collection of all my family 's bits and pieces this piece here is there is my mother 's first necklace so I put it into a portraiture system the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme is what I work with for a long time that spider over there my kids know I hate spots spider so I always turned them up the broken cheese brought up there belong to my brother and he was brokenhearted when he broke it so I decided it would have to go down in the history of a clan at the top there all those old earrings belonged to my friends here that I put in there with a lamb lost one so I 'll put the other one in from memorabilia and and my first watch palmerston City Council 's in here these are old tiles that we 've repainted and put through and so all the family can come and have a little look and think there 's a part of me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like the one that Chris has done down there where it 's a family story hi my name is laylah Petersen and I 've been a member of this art group for the last 12 years now I think and we have a group of people at ladies from all around the community you have really enjoyed learning different types of artwork I 'm really impressed with what I see because there are people here of different ages different physical capacities and it 's obvious that they 're all getting a great deal of creativity out of what they 're doing here this morning which helps them to not only fill in their time but also to make something that 's extremely decorative to their homes or the units and they 're also getting a great deal of social discourse here this morning which is impressive because it helps them to get enjoyment out of their life hi I 'm Jenna Fischer I 'm an artist who works primarily in soft pastel also do some painting medium and drawing I 've been teaching at pams group now for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of months as well so I have the privilege of teaching a really lovely group of women who have had so many different life experiences which I find very inspiring and I I have the privilege of teaching them the soft pastel medium Val Caron I started coming to this our group after I heard about them throughout psalmist Julian brings a group here every Thursday from what I understand and Pam works with them it 's been an eye-opener it 's really my garden has changed my life has changed through through the art it 's I 'm doing things that I never thought I could possibly do it 's and it 's opened up options for me I thoroughly enjoy my work with these Alzheimer 's people and mental health people but I have other people with under my wonderful art teachers who are giving us a broad spectrum of art and craft and some of the craft turned into art and from there on it 's wonderful wonderful atmosphere they did which has been created by the Palmerston people it has particularly on the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a group there now called gone potty and instead of just doing things for the sake of doing them that they 're actually doing something that has meaning and we actually sell sell stuff to the to the public and people go away from there feeling really proud of themselves because they 've achieved something that 's worthwhile instead of just filling in time so it is it 's wonderful our Pam 's unique person a good a great woman who 's had the capacity to be able to bring at a varied bunch of women together the only disappointment is that there are not more black sea and men have a great deal of many problems as they get older and something like this would help them to overcome their isolation from the world so I knew people in common but it was actually Pam that in her amazing way of connecting people she she encouraged me like if she 's really encouraged me as a teacher and she 's opened up an opportunity I wouldn 't otherwise have had otherwise have had a confidence to do either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her generosity in just encouraging me along as it and yeah given me the opportunity to come and work with these women and we do it once a month during pastel and just to see their growth in that time has been really wonderful I 'm a graphic designer by trade commercial artist I went to art school back in the 80s I basically run all these ladies through the lessons that I have learned over my years on beat one lesson at a time some of them have gone on to become really good artists in their own right doing things for money and becoming quite successful and others have just been inspired to just be awesome in every day artwork look how it 's grown started with just six of us every Sunday I 'm really very very keen to express my gratitude to the people of thomaston and the fact that they have allowed me to do this for 12 or 13 years I am all this stuff in here has been donated its people 's treasures that they brought here and and left on the doorstep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greens and things and the Men 's Shed put them all together for me from their hash house Harriet 's over there on this side found me those cupboards and put them together so it 's the generosity of the people that has allowed us to have our group like this through here so we 've got all this through here we 've got our work stuff that we 've got here this there our work cupboards here have got everything that everybody needs in them which they put aunt Amelia always boots the mac and then the other things I haven 't joined this group but I often come over and it 's amazing because Pam will have brought something from the dump shop or being given something and the next minute it 's transformed into something really quite beautiful and lovely piece of artwork so you never know what something starts us and it ends up being something really attractive this lovely couple came out of a rubbish tip and she was minus a cheek and so we put her back together and because she was so ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits and pieces that we need the joy and the motivation that people have got from this art group it brings all these ladies together we 've had gentlemen ladies we 've even had younger people we had a girl who grew up listening to us ladies chattering on Sunday mornings and she 's gone on to become an architect it 's just so inspiring and people have found a joy in something that they didn 't even know they could do some of them many of these people have thrown up not really having art as an important thing and everyone 's realizing what a cultural sort of difference it makes things people together I think it 's it 's very important because it brings the community together we learn of each other we bounce ideas off each other as a as an ad group it 's important but as a social group that 's even more important it 's the social aspect I think that 's so that 's the most important yes yeah well before this group I didn 't really know of any other groups that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist and I guess this is opened up an opportunity of allowing me to meet people that are others would not have met and bringing together women that otherwise would not probably have come together to be able to learn this meeting so submit I think it 's opened up a door and an opportunity for for people to come and learn an art medium whether it be all the different mediums that she has here the otherwise I that I didn 't know existed and I I mean I would love to see more or more groups because I think there 's just such as people say to me they would love to learn art but where do they go to do it where are the openings where the opportunities for them to do that I have to say that I am NOT a teacher of art I 'm a facilitator I 'd never picked up a paintbrush until our retired at the age of 17 and from that I 've developed and in my learning I 've now share it with other people and I bring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they come and then we teach each other and we live off each other and we enjoy doing that so someone 's good at drawing trees they 're the ones that help the others that want to learn to draw three sons that wanted reporter to teach the portraiture and the pastels and how to put the past all together then we have our little jewelry makers that make jewelry there and all that sort of thing as well well it can be ad space but it doesn 't have to only be art spaces there 's a whole range of different activities that people could participate in it might be photography it could be recreational activities seeing so there are many different activities that people can take in providing someone with the creative energy can get them together and motivate them to do things that is a pastoral on black paper that beautiful kangaroo at this is a person who had never done any art at all and just wanted to draw circles in a way they went this is stuff from the rubbish tip that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lover of cats has decided that he would make some cattails and magic acting and this lady over here is her first acrylic paint that she 's painting she 's ever done and hasn 't she done a wonderful job with her birds there so that 's the sort of thing people come and make their science for their front things the number ones in their number twos and that sort of thing we do we do murals we do all paintings we do portraiture we do pastels we do decoupage we do sculpting we work with air dry clay what whatever you fancy we can try to find me all you have to do is ring the council and get my telephone number from there I will it direct you through how to get here everybody 's welcome to come at any time if I 'm home seven days a week I particularly enjoy having people on saturday mornings who can come and see what other people are doing they might only stay for a cup of coffee for the wider community of palmerston i 'm very very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center up and on its way to running embrace it use it enjoy it leave it your IT behind and come and use your hands and your soul and have the and enjoy what you 're doing and you to run might be the person that comes and says I 've been held up a brush but ends up being one of the leaders of the group with the art at the end of the time so these are the people I 'm appealing to go out enjoy it whether you 're a dancer a storyteller a painter or whatever come and enjoy your art center make it live and make then and make palmerston a special special space,"(-12.5148324, 130.9687836)"

Australia",1608,good morning here we are at joe anderson center in palmerston and gray we 're visiting our dementia friendly garden I 'd like to introduce myself I 'm Judy writer Jack I 'm the program manager for Alzheimer 's Australia NT and with me I have harm in Harvey Perez who is the landscape architect has been working on the dementia friendly garden so welcome javi thank you Judy um what we 're going to talk about today is around our gardens at care and Harvey 's been working on developing our first dementia friendly garden in the Northern Territory I 'm Harvey some of the concepts that you 've worked around a based on best practice that have been developed in South Australia yeah so sustainability is one of the main things that you 've spoken about yes so this important key and how I use when I designed this garden is you seen for example irrigation system hardy plant have less long I 'll put more mulch something we then have to look after so much so that is the key of sustainability fantastic and so obviously because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in their memory changes in their ability to plan and find their way around places changes in some of their behaviors orientation is really important yes m for example one of very important a part of this design was to make them the path one look bath so it 's in concrete and our clients they can file on this path and they can be always orientate and we have some features in the garden they help them to be oriented in the garden also to find a way another way yeah that 's fantastic and accessibility I noticed that you know you can be in the kitchen and be actually able to look at and be part of the vegetable garden happening front yard that was very important in in in the design was from inside of the house you can look outside and you can see the veggie garden from the kitchen from the office you can see outside and directly from the main office you can see the guys if is sitting in in the rest area they can the girls the facilitator they can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of socializing areas because like remaining connected to your community and being able to sit and have a conversation with people is really important yes yes yeah meaningful activities we 've got a fantastic art group here that that meet at joy anderson center every second Thursday and they 've actually created a number of items that have gone into the garden yeah so the gas and these clients they 're making a lot of crafts I for example their baths for birds they 're making flower with records a lot of recycling and that 's really important to put that in the garden because they feel very powering with this project so that 's really nice and another kind of activities we do sometimes is doing some telepathic a horticultural it 's trapped like I do some cuttings putting in the pod we saw in some seeds so the clients the feeling power when they show the plant growing so this kind of a staff duty you 're fantastic and you 're telling a story earlier about the ladies that helped you some seedlings the other day I actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping-out program but the minute they 've walked in the front gate you 've actually responded to their seedlings and went straight over to have a look their home go have a look in our little nursery and they were so happy because all the city coming up so this kind of activity is really important is what we want for this memory garden and so memory is making new memories making new friends and and reminiscing around the old days but also the same sorry part of the garden is really important yes we have some so what we what I try to use in the garden is some plans for example Beverly us we have carbon grey villas you have around all Australia and everyone knows grevillea everyone knows Italy stolen and we have that in the garden so they don 't you remember these things and another plant we are using sensitive land like I 'm mariah is like the flowers they have a silly like jasmine and all the veggie garden in the front we have mint so where they can touch the kind of smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test in the garden just have a look sit all the colors relax and have interaction with the gardens were the main thing in this project Judy fantastic you also shared a story about one of the gentlemen you 've been working with around his memories of growing up in in a nursery yes yes it was very special because with him he he knows so much about art culture so we do cuttings and he knows actly were to do the cuttings in the plant we do in putting mix together he know they 're the exactly amount of potting mix we need to use he knows how to put in a plant and also he was really he 's really handy person because we do some activities with one old bike I he knows how to pull out all the piece of the bag a human to put everything in again I don 't know how to do that and he we work as a team so was really nice to have them like a volunteers coming to help the building the garden and they 're really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another story nurse was sitting here I can hear the birds in the background about a gentleman who comes to the garden there was a ranger yes so with him I was ready a special because he was a ranger he work in conservation the north territory so sometimes when he 's very fit so he helped me to do some hard job in the garden but when we have a morning tea in the rest area over there we can have a look this victory we have here is the yellow flame tree and it 's really big habitat for a VA for birds so he knows all the scientific names for every bird we have industry sometimes son birthday they are nesting and he knows the behavior of the of the bird which one is the mail which one is the female so what 's really amazing this meetings a and war with him because she 's helping me to have more knowledge about the natural and honest part of this project have the outdoor and have contact with the natural he knows also Judy they the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the species so was really helpful so for that we 're making some little habitats in the garden cool and attract the wildlife so you 've also developed a flip chart a book of all the animals that visit the garden as well so that not only this particular gentleman yes can be part of developing that project netbook but also to be able to share it with other people that visit the garden as well yeah that that 's part of sustainability attracting my life because with all the develop of the your van a part in the city we are moving a little bit all the animals but if we use native plant attractive a plant with flowers we will be attractive for the clients but also for butterflies so one of the other design principles is around safety obviously we work with vulnerable people are people with dementia the safety is really important for people to be able to engage in the in the environment so some of the principles that you 've used around safety so what do we use with my with the clients I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil without gloves if always they were in shoes no phones and I care about they always have a lot of water they use sunscreen and I 'll so hot absolutely and having dressed in like a a lot of resting seat have a lot of drink and come back to work some sometimes people with dementia might forget to have those breaks and they might forget to drink as well so it 's really important to have someone volunteers working alongside our clients as well to be able to support them so welcome to our memory garden it 's open to the community and we fight all people to come in and enjoy joy the garden helped by volunteering and supporting us thank you to the city of Palmerston as well as to Harvey and who

terms of planting vegetation over the next four years in celebration of the anzac centenary given that the centenary and the whole program is about going from Gallipoli right through to Afghanistan the city of Parsons got a lot of young families defense families and so when there was an opportunity to put in an expression of interest by the council to see if we could be considered for a connection with this program we were absolutely delighted to hear that one of the corporates which is Telstra said look we 'd like to be a part of this and indeed some other corporates have done the same so they said look we 'll back some programs in every state and territory and out of the programs that they had received and heard about in the territory they chose the city of Palmerston as the project that they would work with welcome Nick this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the city of parmesan was absolutely delighted with this expression of interest for the living memorials the anzac program of tree planting and and we were delighted also that telstra came on board nationally as a corporate so i was just wondering from your point of view and what did it mean for telstra here to be connected in the one site with the city of person and i 'm also interested were some of the volunteers on the day from the city of parson as well as from the city of darwin yeah so thank you it was great to be involved it 's great to be involved in such an and after what a national event to also making it very local so we 're very proud to be part of the Northern Territory community and we do get involved with local sponsorships and why for community events through sporting groups and councils and the voluntary program is just one of those things we like to do the group came specifically from the Darwin office from my team to business team and the government team but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tie in there and we certainly have a opportunity to do some more of that as we go ahead now given it 's the dry season when we 're starting the filming for this we 're actually having a short days planting today and we 're doing understory plantings because it 's very important that people get a good experience with planting it 's also very important that we do it appropriately the other states and particularly eastern and southern states they 're actually in the winter now so all their plan things will be happening over the next few months even the next few weeks but we 're doing one planting this understory planting before the 30 years of June which was part of the program to get involved and then we 've had permission and Telstra very agreeable to work with us and do some more planting with their staff later in the year from Telstra 's point of view they 're very pleased as many corporates are keen eye to get staff volunteering at some stage during their year each year so conservation volunteers Australia they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling out the program across the nation on behalf of the living memorials so today we 've got a combination happening we 've got conservation volunteers Australia the Northern Territory section who 've worked with council to set the day up

a member of local lan care groups so she 's going to also do hands-on as as i am to i 'm here at sanctuary lakes this morning put the anzac living memorial tree planting program it 's a really beautiful morning actually this morning breeze is blowing guys blew ducks are quacking and there 's lots of water lilies over here in the lakes and it 's really great to have this team from Telstra here volunteering along with conservation volunteering Australia and city of Palmerston to be planting trees in memorial forensic so it 's a great morning so working with the city of Palmerston today conservation volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small team of eight volunteers and they 're helping us to revegetate some of the garden beds that they 've got around sanctuary lengths lakes here so we 're playing planting native species back into the area so the understory species just to fill in some of the garden beds that are looking a bit there at the moment this is all part of a living memorial program so as part of the Anzac 100 years centenary program that conservation but volunteers is running across Australia so we 've just got a small number today upwards of 140 plants just to in feel as I said so we 're not doing a mass planting it 's more just in feeling the area 's being a volunteer organization we always really appreciate the hard work that the volunteers put in for us so obviously they 're volunteering their time and we really do appreciate all the efforts they come along and give their time to help out on these projects because without them we wouldn 't have this program running and I was just wondering with the staff that attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy it and also our some of them going to be in the plantings later in the year or are they all new people absolutely so because if she mentioned before we started a new financial year so therefore a whole new team have come on board and a whole new opportunity to volunteer in some volunteer time out the community we 've had more interest now since we 've gone back for some fabulous comments came back from the team did that day we 've actually got more and we 're going to have a more people involved in that in the next event you hold and the next event and the event after that as well so we 've certain a pretty strong team up here in territory that are committed as a one team Telstra and we have solutely want to be involved in more things that you do it 's a real opportunity also for us to showcase palmerston several of the people who are here today from Telstra for instance only two of the eight are actually from suburbs within cumson the others are from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually don 't know palms and other than maybe coming down to a specific shop or they pass by cumson on the

hear the people who are here today saying wow this is really nice we didn 't know that you had these sort of areas and of course sanctuary lakes is just a delightful area the lakes are free of weeds at this time of the year the lilies are right the bird life is tremendous we 've got the rahjah Shellback duck and just little ducklings here today but going back to what more we want to do with this I think it 's important to remember that council has got a sustainability strategy which is a five-year strategy it was endorsed by counsel at the end of 2013 and very there are ten objectives and it starts with governance and it goes right through to climate change it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number four with the local environment managed councils open space for long term by increasing the connectivity of biodiversity and habitat corridors so that 's what part of today is about continue to implement actions with councils current open spaces continue to liaise with governments and non-government organisations with the management of areas of significance this is an area of significance it doesn 't necessarily need to mean that it 's just a heritage area from ancient city of Parsons roaring ahead that 's development it 's going to be the largest regional center in the Northern Territory it 's a winner of the sustainable cities Awards last year with keep Australia beautiful and represented the Northern Territory nationally so collectively today is cancelled building seeing opportunities talking to business talking to corporates talking to other environmental organizations and it 's been pulled together and so today will be just a delight of planting talking learning and making new friendships and we 'll continue the story of the planting later in the wet season we could a range of plants here from grinning Australia and Hannah from conservation volunteering Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Telstra volunteers their plants are predominantly natives local to the Palmerston area acacia 's and various gum trees and some flowering trees as well so it 's just wondering are there any other comments that you 'd like to make or are any tips that we might have behaved for us for the next plantings I think just think one of the things we could have done was actually got more of the field service guys involved so we specifically use the team out of my office in in the city but after that consultation with the rest of the team we definitely have some stores involved some of the licensee community involved so they 're the ones that run the store such as power mr. and Darwin and absolutely we near the field service guy so you spend a lot of time out the road digging and doing that sort of stuff so that 's certainly not the equipment to help out as well so we definitely need to be a team of allah getting strong as well well I think that 's terrific and actually maybe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what parts of Telstra that the next group are coming from it was through chat on the morning that we sort of heard who was work from what part of Telstra because we sort of went round the group and we told where we were from in our work and but that would be just terrific and also to say that we 'll be choosing different locations around the city of parson and at all this goes forward four years ahead and we 'd like to say that at any time in the sure Telstra employees and their families and those that were involved and even those that weren 't involved but nobody are very welcome to come down and towards the end will actually provide you with a map of the different locations for your staff that would be wonderful wonders they just send us invitations when you do something you want some more to help we 're absolutely happy to be involved thank you Nick that 's terrific nice thank you like to thank the volunteers from Telstra for in coming along and coming on for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit different probably to their office jobs on a normal day luckily it 's a beautiful cool morning for them so very much thanking Telstra and conservation volunteering Australia and also greeting Australia for the plants and also for from our council perspective our climate change and environment strategic planner Pam Robinson so thank you so a very big thank you to Telstra conservation volunteers and indeed city of Palmerston because it now through this project and in the filming of this event it 'll be available as an excellent example of what can be done when a little bit of support and some innovative ideas come along that we can participate in you,"(-12.5148324, 130.9687836)"

Australia",1407,the city of Palmerston is very proud to be a refugee welcomed zone and this week is World Refugee week world refugee weaker for us in Darwin goes from the 13th to the 21st of june and what a fantastic theme this year with courage let us all combined you may be shocked to learn that excellent phrase comes from our national anthem it 's part of the mysterious second verse that most people don 't remember and yet someone has thought that this would be a perfect theme to make sure that we all welcome people of refugee background to Australia and we recognize that people of refugee background also have shown great courage in coming here I 'll just mention that verse for those who have come across the seas with boundless Plains to share with courage let us all combine to Advance Australia Fair I 'm hello everyone my name is Jan earlier and I 'm this year 's aunty ambassador for World Refugee week this event is very special to me because this is our story like my family I with contests rally as refugees what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melaleuca refugee center is not alone at all in organizing this with take encouraging our hands to combine with about 14 organizations and we 're all doing different events to try and and reach out and make it more person to person during the celebrations this year personally I believe celebrating refugee week is very important event for us as a community not just Australia by the wider world to to just take a time to you know reflect on the challenges faced by refugees and our the courage they demonstrate in overcoming all the challenges that they faced but also it 's a time for us to support the many people said the many refugees in other parts of the world that might you know be replaced due to civil war due to floods so it 's a time for us as a community to support them and remember them as well one of our big events is on Saturday with a terrific refugee cup soccer tournament and that involved our third year of organizing that but key parties to that is definitely the wonderful group football without borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador for World Refugee week one of our role is to if we can to try and attend events that might be happening in our communities and yes I 'll be attending basically old events that are happening during this World Refugee week for example I attended the football Cup that just happened on saturday and i had the privilege of presenting the the cup to the winners the football cup involved Darwin high school the adult migrant English program look anglicare relationships NT and those close to our heart multicultural council of the NT we 're just constantly collaborating to try and between us really put our small resources together so that others can have a good time also I 'll be attending the film called the good life which which is run by the city of Palmerston so you can find me there I 'll because this film is really close to my heart because it 's a journey of you know young people who left their country Sudan and that 's where actually my parents are from so it 's really really close to my heart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and I hope to see you all there you 'll have a chance to learn but also to see what it what it means like for these people to live their country and try to settle into a new community which basically they had no idea of thomaston City Council have taken a huge step to become a welcome zone for Refugees like explicitly formally promising to welcome refugees in this beautiful city of Palmerston the good lie is an extraordinary film that helps you understand the journey of children and get right into there I 'd say into their shoes but they don 't have any into their long long journey of escape and also to understand a bit about her the huge challenges of settlement with Reese Witherspoon to who goes on a bit of a journey herself so that will be on Saturday in Palmerston and another event that I 'd be looking forward to is that Darwin welcome lunch I 'm sure most of you might be you know most of you might love food and you know meeting you pee so this is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also it 's time for you to maybe share your story but also learn from someone else about their journey and so bring something to share and I hope to see you there and something very close to my heart is there youth flashmob performance that will be actually where young people will be involved in performance it can be at it 's a secret place so you might be surprised to see a lot of young people could be at cuz Rena or somewhere else so keep an eye out for that and I hope to see as many young people if I can around there and yes see you around special thanks to the people at trax dance company who have incredible expertise in working with people whether they 're professional or amateur to put on these events and there 's also a youth picnic as well we have the deck chair theater on thursday and there 'll be a wonderful you may not think of it as a refugee film but it is the sound of music will be on thursday and that 's completely supportive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special advocacy group for people who are in detention the people we don 't see who don 't get to be out meeting and greeting with us too often this year 's theme is with courage let us all combined and it 's a very you know meaningful theme to me personally because you know i guess the courage really came from my parents so my parents you know fled their hometown South Sudan to Uganda you know for example mom was carrying my dad 's little brothers on their back handy and she had you know stuff on her head I guess that was the courage for them to live their home country they 're totally different environment to settle in a refugee camp unexpected of what it 's going to be like and it 's also encouraged for them to try to escape you know that life to come to Australia for example with mom having no English at all and having to to learn you know that 's a college because sometimes if you didn 't have the courage to to do something you basically wouldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have the courage to speak in front of you and tell you about my journey as a young South Sudanese was a young Ugandan because I was born there and it takes courage for us to share this kind of stories so this theme this year with courage letters all combined means so much to me and I hope that as a community we will take the courage to attend these events meet new people learn but also maybe share our stories because it takes a courage for less for us all to learn and to share so to celebrate we 're inviting all our residents and their guests to come along and watch a film called The Good lie it stars reese witherspoon and is about a group of sudanese refugees that settle in America it 's a very uplifting and triumphant movie it 's on this Saturday night the twentieth of june from 630pm the movie starts at seven but please come a little bit earlier to enjoy the coffee cake and popcorn put on by the adult migrant education program so once again this saturday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week with the city of Palmerston you,"(-12.5148324,

name is Danny McNeil and I 'm the general manager of citizen kids Northern Territory citizen kids and tears are not-for-profit organization and non-government we rely on the great nature of territories to support us and to keep our services continuing and free this year marks erty years that we 've been providing territory families with bereavement support and education what we provide is a lot more than support through since we provide support for parents families and communities who experienced the unimaginable the loss the death of a child from conception up until the age of 18 so that can include miscarriage stillbirth sudden illness such as an asthma attack an accident car accident fire also used suicide and of course its support so a lot more than suits the other aspect of our organization is that we provide resources education and support for new and expectant parents grandparents and carers about safe sleeping and minimizing the risks of a sleeping accident in suits a really important resource for the community and for new and expectant parents is safe sleeping brochures and information all this information can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have brochures and information at our office but you can call us at any time and have a chat if you 've got any queries have any product questions we 're here to help you and to make you informed and aware of the best sleeping environment you can provide your baby and try and minimize sleep accidents and risks unfortunately the Northern Territory has the highest rate of children 's deaths under one per capita in Australia so the support that Susan qmt provides the community and parents is extremely important what we offer is a free support service to anyone who needs someone to chat to who wants to receive support after they go through the unimaginable the death of their child so what we do is we have some really important and valuable people who answer our 24 hour phone line so people can call that any time so that can be a parent it can be a grandparent it can be a concerned friend or relative who just want some advice on how they can best help support their friend through miscarriage or stillbirth or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of 18 so the services that we provide really depends on the family and the circumstances each situation is extremely different and we will provide the support that is needed so sometimes it 'll be crisis support so that can be at the initial time of death and so it 's helping the family through that traumatic experience and advocating and assisting them with support and helping answer any questions and getting information for them it can also be visiting families within their home or at a neutral location providing that support and assistance sometimes the level of support needed goes beyond our fantastic parents support and we do have additional resources through our counselor and so those services are free as well we have a long relationship with our families and we 're there for them the entire time they need it so sometimes families might call us immediately it might be a couple of months after the death of their baby or child could be years down the track it doesn 't really matter at all and we 're there to support them and provide any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which help reflect and remember any babies or children that have passed alone it 's a great opportunity for the community to come together and to recognize and remember they 're angels you another really important part of season kids NT is fundraising and we can 't provide the services and support that we do to the community which is free without a massive fundraising effort throughout the year so red nose is one of those campaigns but you might see us at barbecues and events but we need people to come on board and to join us to help support us and a lot of people say we 'd like to support you but we don 't know how and getting involved as a volunteer is a great way you can do that and it can be in a range of different events so if you pop on to our facebook page so facebook.com forward slash to think is empty or email last darwin attitudes and kids to all and join our mailing list i would love to have you on board as a volunteer and it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're comfortable and the event said get great fun and a great way to give back to citizen kids NT and also the community so we have red nose coming up and red nose in the NT is pretty special where you run a month-long campaign in the month of june with red nose been the last friday of doing so that 's the 26th of during this year so we have some of our friends joining us today and they 're going to be available for so in the months of truth but we 've got lots of events and activities happening throughout the month which would love you to be involved in or you can organize your own event create exposure and awareness for our organization and red nose another really important and very special event for Susan kids NT is our walk to remember this is held this year on the thirtieth of August at sanctuary lakes and guns it 's a great day it 's a fun day but it 's also a reflective day so we come together as a community we have balloons which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have music and this year being 30 years of students in kids NT we 're hoping to make it a great and special event so we come together and we have some poems that are red and we walk around the lake were in a reflective mode and then we release balloons sin sin cos NT support staff and parents supporters will be there to assist families to help them through the day but it 's a great chance for those who have lost a baby or child or know of someone or those people have relocated to the territory and want a chance to remember someone who might not be as close by so this is a fantastic event last year we had over 120 people attend would love to build that to be bigger and better and have the community come together for a great event to remember our angels and to support citizen kids and those families who 've gone through the unimaginable we 'd love your support in any way so whether it 's through

go to square TV my name is Serena shut and I 'm an alderman at the city of Palm erson and today we 're talking to Emily from the core mob smart calling in the tropics Emily nice to see you today Thank You Serena how are you I 'm very well so can you tell me a little bit about smart calling in the tropics yep smart cooling in the tropics is a new funded fully funded project by the Commonwealth Department of Industry so we 've received money to audit energy audit 480 homes in the territory it 's the only one of its kind in northern territory and tropical environment and we 're looking at research and data after we ordered those homes on what actions that we implement will actually make good savings on people 's energy bills and also on their thermal comfort so in 2014 I understand there 's a lot of people that have received some very high energy bills and I note that a lot of people are looking at ways that they can decrease their power bills and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right it 's fantastic it 's only for eligible household but it is a free funded project so I reiterate that because it 's really important a lot of people get scared that all free thing but we go out to people 's homes and will audit their homes have a look at what they 're using and how they 're using energy in the in the home the housing design and then offer them some free services and those services can range from monitors energy timers for pools and pumps or you know appliances then right through to the higher end stuff which is external shading shade cloth blinds as well as roof ventilation air conditioning clean so there 's a whole lot of free stuff and we do help people understand energy bills and try and reduce just through other actions as well in the home so who 's eligible for this okay so anyone who owns a private home so a private home or private rental so it could be owned or mortgaged or you can be in a private rental and you have to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pensioners the carers allowance care women or Kara 's payment you can live in yearly housing and then you could just be meeting our criteria on low income which could include the amount of children that you have all dependents in the home so it 's best to just give us a call and talk to us around and we can talk you through what 's eligible so I also hear you run some really amazing workshops can you tell us about the workshops that you hold and who are they for okay so therefore all our participants but we have opened it up to pretty much anyone who might be interested in that category of coming along in an eligibility category if they wanted to come along and have a look at how to understand you can 't as you go look at better ways to use their home and appliances to reduce their energy and we hold those at the Palmerston community library as well as the cash Rena community library down there at kazarina so in 30 seconds what other highlights of what the cool mob actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foremost friendly staff project officer to come out and have a look at your home give you some really good ideas and give you a report on on how you can do things better as well as free actions so some of those things I talked about earlier some of those treatments that we can provide to your home and the great workshops to follow up that the workshop the program finishes project finishes at the end of this year so we 've got 480 spots of about 200 of God so if we can get more people in and then it 's all finished so getting quick if they can okay so cool mob and smart cooling in the tropics have partnerships with community organizations can you tell us a bit about that Emily ok so we 've partnered up with Kota witches Council on the aging melaleuca refugee center as well as yearly housing and carers NT and their partnerships to help us recruit people so if anybody is already a membership has a membership with those organizations they can contact through them directly to get ahold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have actually a hand out to all those people that might be eligible for this project we also have a partnership with CD you Charles down University and they 're collecting all the data so the data that we do collecting these surveys at people 's energy assessments and audience that goes to see to you and then ultimately Cyro where they will be put into some sort of hopefully larger report that can look at housing needs and how we can improve people 's thermal comfort in the future and housing design so I understand that you have gone to many households already and there 's some good news stories have come out of it have you gotten examples of a case study of a really good news story of the energy that they 've used decreasing yep so a lot of the the hard data hasn 't come through yet but we have had some anecdotal evidence just from a couple of participants one receive roof paint and if we had temperature and data loggers within the home to measure how much you used air conditioning if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing within a few hours she said that she realized that it be 2 to 3 degrees cooler on the temperature gauges that she was looking at within the roof paint going on so that 's one just anecdotal evidence but obviously the hard data will come at the end another lady here in palmerston was audited and she said that after we provided an actions on her report to follow she 's compared it with her last wet season bill and this wet season bill was actually twenty-five percent lower than last last year so just with some basic actions that we can you know get people to do and a lot of its behavior change as well Wow twenty-five percent decrease yeah that 's awesome it 's usually very achievable to just that those sort of levels because people don 't recognize smaller things that they can do around the home so when 's the report going to be released think sometime in 2015 maybe mid to late January even februari and that will be just the start report but hopefully it will all feed into as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get maybe some good policies back to government to say this is how people feel and this is what they suffer from because thermal comfort and we already we can recognize that it 's not so much temperatures that we receive and down but the humidity that really knocks people around decreasing humidity absolutely how we 're going to do hey every little bit counts flow Oh have you got a website that people can go to we do so it would be w WM are also to contact core mob what 's a contact number to contact you Emily okay so if people are thinking that they might be eligible for this project please get in quickly the number is 8 9 8 1 36 42 and give us a call we can always help you and check it out and cool mob might be able to put you on a list if you don 't meet at eligibility for some other stuff outside of this project anyway do you have any final messages for the city of Palm erson residents I think the biggest thing is to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use passive cooling where you can fans can often and jumping in the pool can be so much better than switching on the aircon just turn it turn it up a few degrees on the aircon and have a fan running at the same time what is the ideal temperature that the air conditioner should be on okay so we recommend 26 to 27 degrees with a fan running and as I said it 's runner it 's not so much about the temperature which people go 27 it 's actually about the humidity so that 's what the air conditioner will do 27 is a very comfortable temperature for most people with a fan running it just reduces that humidity in the air and it 's really important to stay hydrated and jump in a pool whenever you can yes that 's correct Thank You Emily from cool mob for coming by and please continue to watch gorda square TV here add comment you you,"(-12.5148324, 130.9687836)"

Australia",1183,so I 'm Gillian McQueen from Alzheimer 's we 've been using the giantess and center for the last year now it 's a place where now the clients can come and they they have started calling it a home away from home now it 's a place where they can come and feel comfortable and then they know exactly where to go it 's we can also use the the kitchen and we can do a lot of projects ongoing projects that we can also involve the community as well so it 's some as a respite service they feel a lot more comfortable coming here Gerry Anderson Center is a place where people living with dementia can meet and enjoy the company of people of their own age and have opportunity to socialize and mix with the broader community at the same time giving their carers or the partners a break so they can do their own activities as well so it 's generally a young very pleasant place to come and visit and it 's the groups are usually small and so it 's not too confronting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nice and quiet and very home-like atmosphere you a part of the project is to have a nice garden that the clients and visitors will be able to enjoy in being a sensory garden as well as a quiet area for people to mix and have quite conversation together so that 's a project that we 're very enthusiastic to pursue and so a lot of emphasis will go on this garden as a dementia friendly environment and they also have favorite places in the house where they like to go and they can sort of go off and do their own thing as well and feel comfortable about being in another room and then obviously after we 've we 've done an activity we all come together and have lunch and the great thing about that is that we can use that the oven and we do a lot of home cooking so we go through the recipe books and they can pick out you know all the recipes that they used to do and the house just smells beautiful it just smells like home cooking and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss with Palmerston Council being able to use Joe Anderson more so through through the liaison with that the council we now come to Joy Anderson every day we start here and we end here and the clients love coming to joy Anderson and it 's been a really positive effect for our clients living with dementia as well as the staff and the community because we 're able to invite other services and support support people in so it 's just been a really positive and amazing project and now we 're going to be doing the garden the garden part of the joy anderson center is seems to be a wonderful concept it 's been properly designed so that it will have everything we need for dementia clients the front part here is going to be a veggie garden with a path all the way around the house so that people can stroll around and they 'll be rest areas so they can sit and rest there 'll be a little rest area beside the veggie garden where they can do a bit of work go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very generously have a guard gardening designer who 's designing the garden for us and it will be dementia friendly specific in this rest area we will make one nice pergola with nice Kleinberg one little fish pond ladies a client they can you fit the fish and we will make one path system like this a client as well they can have a wall and do some exercise there will be sensory gardens for smell and touch and taste and there will be lots of shade and outdoor spaces that we 'll be able to do art and crafts and those sort of things on the right weather but they 'll also be weatherproof outdoor areas so they we can share inside and outside with the activities we need to do most of the garden beds will be raised so that the clients don 't have to bend over and work and weed and plant so they 'll be raised garden beds there are different styles of those raised garden beds that can be used so the idea is the path continues to here and in this corner we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one nice pergola and one little pond here so the client they concede and can have a look the garden oh the client they can keep going and working for the FAFSA stem and we will have in this close defense yes a nice shrubs and here we will make a nice allo garden and we will direction the path to here and after we pass from here to the end like this they can do some exercise and and the sensory Gardens got both sides of the house so you get perfumed plants different perfumes going as they walk past there 's a sense what they call a sensory garden the garden that we 've got planned out dementia-friendly garden will be the first one in the territory so it 's going to be fantastic this is something that we hope is going to be ready well sooner hopefully before the end of the year would be fantastic we 're so lucky it 's been this ripple effect of people that have just in the community have come forward and I think it 's going to get done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center is located at 25 dillon circuit in gray prior to that we used to go locked out to the politicians rooms community areas libraries which we still like to use because we like to also be involved with the community we like to let them know that we exist and we 're so looking forward now there 's so many projects that we have ongoing now and we hope in the future that we can now invite some of these organizations back to the joy anderson center and show them what with what we 've been up to this video or film of the dementia friendly garden at joy anderson center is just the first stage of some really having a before photo to show what the garden currently looks like and then we 'll be able to do a comparison with another video when we 've made some progress with it and then hopefully when it 's completed so we 'll have the full picture of how it developed so that will be wonderful to share with everybody thank you you,"(-12.5148324, 130.9687836)"

Australia",1631,hi it 's serrano from the city of parmesan and today we 're talking to ross the market coordinator of the parmesan markets hi ross how are you today hi surrounded good fabulous so tell us a little bit about the history of the palmerston markets here in palmerston well the markets have been going for a long time and so far back that i don 't even remember when they started i 've been in darwin in the area about 30 years and i 've been going for a long time in about 1996 i think it was um it went from the council sort of running the markets to the stall holders taking over and forming an association and that 's how it 's run now the uh the stall holders elected committee and the committee makes the management decisions so that 's a really good point the council doesn 't officially run the markets it 's totally independent and their association runs the markets right yes that 's right we liaise closely with the council because we have a licence from the council to run the markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are moving out of our normal area in goiter square while that area is being redeveloped and we 're going to be down a bit further down near the recreation center where the craft stores were last year fabulous so who are the sponsors and the supporters of this year 's event well as usual palmerston city council support the markets and we 've been working with them we do have other people and other community groups who come down and support the markets um local dance trips that surprise some of the entertainment karate groups some of the political mlas like the pinocchio they help us with photocopying from time to time so it 's um community other community organizations that have an input into the markets also help us so how many how many stalls do you have at the markets each year um it varies from week to week to a certain degree because we do have casual stalls in the dry season who come in and they might be traveling through and you know add that bit of variety so it 's normally about between 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then it changes through the year as we get an influx of casual people coming from the cold climbs from down south and what type of market stalls do you have there 's a really wide range of market stalls yes well the core group i suppose are the the hot food stores and the coal food stalls that um everyone loves to come down and get their luxor or their curry or their crepe or their sushi whatever there 's about 40 of those guys and then there 's probably another 10 to 15 fresh fruit and vegetable stores and it 's amazing to see how much produce that local produce mainly goes through the markets on a friday night people come down and stock up for the weekend because it 's friday night yeah i 'm getting really excited i do have a ritual where i go to the markets i grab my curry i get my fresh food and also check out a lot of the other stores as well which is a lot of fun so if you wanted to apply to be a stall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to go to our website which is www pharma it 's a long one and you can download an application form or you can call me on zero four five nine three eight four one zero three and i can give you the details we are limited this year on being able to accept new food stores because we 're in a smaller area which has a restriction on the amount of power and space but arts and crafts stalls new arts and craft stores are welcome to apply and hopefully next year when we get back into the revamped quarter square area we can look at some bringing some new um variety into our food stores as well so um to bring the family down to the markets for a friday evening what would be the highlights of the entertainment well we have uh one of the kids favorites who 's hype of the clown and she does a lot of um dancing and singing with the young kids and they just love it and the mother 's father sort of sit back while the kids are up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of provides the music in the background so we 'll have a similar format this year it 's probably going to be a smaller area down on the grassed area at the end of the recreation center so um it won 't be as loud and as boisterous as it normally is but um we will have a variety of of um performers through the year as well other kids shows um belly dancers that then you know a good variety of stuff that you can expect to see at the markets so it 's a really great opportunity for community groups to hold a stall there to get it really good exposure for the community to know what 's happening around palmerston that 's right um community stores come down um they can sell lottery to get raffle tickets or whatever to help raise money or they can raise awareness for their group we have um dance groups come down and show their skills karate groups all those sort of community groups are welcome to come down to have a community stalls a normal ten dollar fee just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally also have some religious and political stores who just are giving information to the general public about what their uh services are as well fabulous and also the puppy dogs that sometimes get brought down as well from paws yes i 'm not sure where we 're going to find a spot for them this year because they have to be away from the food stores obviously but we will um find a spot for them because they raise money for for helping to look after abandoned dogs and animals that 's for other pets i suppose fabulous so any final messages and contact details uh well just the the website or the facebook page you can go to our facebook page and send us a message on that um the first of may is our opening night so don 't forget that one and other than that i think it 's going to be a fabulous dry season we 've already had a little taste of that last couple of days and everyone loves to come down on the first night we 're going to try to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming through and that was amazing last year i remember the excitement in the crowd as that lion those lion dancers went down through the food area it was like being in the middle of some great mardi gras or something what is the date of the first parmesan markets and how long does it go for okay the markets are going to start on the first of may this year and we 'll go right through to the end of october i think it 's the 30th of october last year we finished on halloween which was a good note to finish on so we 'll be the day before halloween so we might still sneak in a bit of celebrations there every friday night except for show week i think we have one week off for darwan show because um obviously people go and drive to the darwin show so we don 't want to compete with them and every friday night officially from five till nine but of course people are allowed to start selling their produce about two o 'clock in the afternoon so if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come a bit earlier to pick up your fresh fruit and veg or grab your drink or

I 'm Heather Malone deputy mayor and I 'm here today talking to kevin cooper with regards to our concerns about the banana freckle kevin my first question is what is banana freckle well banana freckle is actually a common name for three different species of a fungus that in fact bananas and one of those three species occurs in across Australia and doesn 't cause us any problems but the other two are foreign to Australia and the one that we 've just found in august 2013 that 's one of those that we don 't want in a strainer and it causes significant production losses across banana crops okay alright so why is the national banana freckle education program needed so you 're a dication program that 's basically kicked off in earnest from october last year up until that time were in the response phase and that was delineating where the freckle actually occurred in the Northern Territory so now the program 's setting about eradicated freckle from the Northern Territory and to do that that 's kind of mean the destruction of all banana plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the fickle was known to occur so we 've through our work we 've been able to show that freckle that new strain of fickle was found in those red zones and so now what we 're doing is seeking to remove freckle the plants so that the freckle will not survive in those red zones okay so what does it look like in our area what does banana freckle look like fickle is is essentially a small sort of pimple sized lesion on the leaves a little bit smaller but it has a very sandpapery appearance to it now I would hope at the moment at this phase of the campaign you 're not likely to see very many cases of freckles most of the properties that have had freckled have been destroyed and the number of places remaining with banana Lance is small compared we were three months ago so but we certainly keen for people to be on a lookout for freckle particularly those areas outside the eradication zones so sandpapery like and and about the size of a pimple and they 'll occur on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in less i got the fruit okay and how is it spread I 'm spread most easily is actually by humans by people moving plant material around that 's why at the moment there 's a restriction on plants being moved so you can 't move but other plants into out of or within a red zone unless they 're going to a tip so moving plants is the highest risk and so we 'd like people not to do that in a natural setting water is a key ingredient in terms of moving freckle around but in the urbanized environment waters still a factor but it 's not understood how well water plays a part in that moving in the air that is by wind is not well documented for freckle trickle only occurs on banana plants does not survive in the soil so it doesn 't get a moved around as such with the soil gets moved around with banana plants so it 's the plant material it 's the secret to stopping the spread good ok so how widespread is our problem in the Northern Territory so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six eradication red zones so clearly the Darwin is the biggest of those so it includes the rural area so runs right down but we had cases confirmed at t we daily river rum jungle bachelor so one side Dundee beach and ramen Guinea so the good news is to date that all the banana plants have been removed from a man Guinea and TE so or read the disease that was there is disappearing because there 's no plants it 's not going to survive and we have very few plants left at wrong jungle bachelor and also daily riddle so inside the Darwin area is where the majority of the 226 cases were found on both Cavendish and non Cavendish so all varieties of bananas affected so how is the best way to stop the spread best way to stop the spread is to remove banana plans if there 's note that on a plane these this fungus this new strain of freckle cannot survive so cut the plant out treat the plan and once the plant decomposes there 's no possibility of that host surviving what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got three phases and we 're currently in phase one which is actually the destruction phase so we are identifying all the locations with plants and those plants are being removed so phase phase one runs to the end of April this year 's are April 2015 so all the plants alone be removed from the red zones by then and with the solid support of the community we 're on track it 's going very well we 're happy we 're going to reach that phase two referred to as the fallow period will run from May this year may 2015 through the end of April 2016 so that is no plants inside the eradication red zones okay and whatever I was looking forward to is basically first of may 2016 from then on through to April 2017 is the replanting phase the sentinel phase so that 's where there 'll be controlled reintroduction we want a lot of people three and a half to four thousand households to will provide them with plants and those plants will act as sentinels so that we can be sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back to normal there will still be some monitoring in the following 12 months basically things will be normalized after that don 't okay is there help with the destruction of the banana plants available for the residents one of the key activities of the program at the moment is any premise that 's identified with banana plants so whether it 's a commercial grower or a household they have the option of either removing the plants themselves which are about ten percent of people have done and thank you very much for that support but the freckle team as it were yeah we 'll come out and assist with removal of the plant and also the removal of the plant material off site and people can read for an appointment and that includes a saturday so favoring the hotline the team will be able to come out and meet with the time that suits them okay does the actual banana freckle affect the actual fruit but unfree collects both the fruit and the productivity of the plane so certainly what 's well known across the community is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prepared to accept those blemishes but in a marketplace the people that buy plant buy bananas are not prepared to accept those blemishes so they kept the fruit gets downgraded but what 's more important is that this disease will reduce productivity of the plants by up to thirty five percent so that 's that 's pretty much one out of three bananas won 't be grown in the future of this disease was become established and that if it is established in a commercial sense people would have to start using increased use of fungicide to try and control the disease so two creases you increase costs one because you get less bananas and then also more use of fungicide to actually control the freckle okay will they still be availability of bananas in our market absolutely we are working very closely with the wholesalers particularly around darlin and they 've actually got permits in place to be able to continue to acquire but honors and supply them to the supermarkets and we 're working with a couple of them closely to also try and get supply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important part of what is the culture of down and the surrounding areas and with the price of bananas is that going to whole program going to affect the price of bananas there 's no indication at the moment that the supplier that arm is particularly to darlin but also there 's some of those regional areas is going to increase we 've clearly been keeping an eye on that where consumers like everyone else so we 've been having look each time we go to the supermarket and we 're pretty confident at the moment that the bananas supplying into Darwin provided these no cyclones and things that affect where they grown should be pretty much what people would expect them to be okay how do we know that the person at our front door is from the banana freckle program look this is very important to us that when people are meeting someone from the program they do ask for their identification so the first thing that ought to be very obvious is that they have a very distinctive shirt which has enter government and also the freckle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one out of the two that attend will have an authority card with a picture an ID on them as an inspector under the Act so if they don 't have that idea I 'd suspect I ought to contact the program or they contact the police because they 're not a legitimate member part of the program so how do they actually contact the the team that can ring the hotline or they can send us an email so the hotline 1-800 double 711 63 or a banana at NTIA you and we 'll get back to them if we can 't answer it straight away but it 's pretty much there seven and the email is very good for us because that I will we 're able to get back to people in their time as well as ours okay in closing I was just wondering if you had any further comments or advice that you could give our banana growers or residents that are still feeling concerned what 's really important is we can eradicate banana freckle from the Northern Territory this this is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the community across the board not only with the destruction phase which is around focus on that the management around movements there 's a high level of compliance around that and so if we continue to get that support will be outlawed addict ated right now in the phase the key thing is any plant that remains in a red zone is a potential reservoir for the fungus into the future so if we all keep working together to remove those plants by the end of april we 're going to be well on our way to eradicating freckle from the Northern Territory fantastic okay I really appreciate your time today and thank you very much for coming in that was kevin cooper from the banana freckle eradication program and thank you very much for coming in to spend some time with us and answer our concerns today Kevin thanks very much Heather thank you,"(-12.5148324, 130.9687836)"
