AUS,QLD,Brisbane City Council,Brisbane City Council,https://www.youtube.com/c/BrisbaneCityCouncil1,School lesson - Mangrove adaptations,kHiCUwKkdWc,20200714,479.57,"Brisbane City QLD 4000, Australia",1080,[Music] we 're down here at Nagi Beach the Tavel band dargon mangrove Walk which means place of saltwater and today we 're going to look at six different mangrove species and we 're gonna look at their adaptations to dealing with this environment when we talk about adaptations we 're talking about unique features which enable a plant or an animal to survive in a particular environment or habitat yes so these particular mangroves have to do with a higher man of salinity okay so we 're gonna look at a few different ways they deal with that absolutely it 's a very challenging environment but now a mangrove species up to the challenge let 's have a look at number one let 's do it Wow first mangrove we 're gonna look at today is the milky mangrove also known as the blind your eye because you don 't want to get this SAP in your life where would we find this Bango it 's found more at the high tide mark so it doesn 't get full inundation with saltwater like some about other species but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how does it do this it is a salt concentrator so it concentrates the salt in its older leaves and then those leaves drop off and that 's its way of getting rid of excess salts in the plant sort of like a sacrificially introducing the yellow mangrove so obviously the tell-tale sign that it 's a yellow mangrove that yellowish green Econ telltale sign is the leaves always point upwards this mangrove species have a buttress root which means their roots and to sit above the surface of the month and that helps them to stabilize the cool thing that these guys they have cool proper guilt and that 's their C+ long it 's sticking yeah and what they 'll do they 'll break off land in the water and they 're always float vertically okay once they fight find some mud I 'll actually grow on you over here we have the river mangrove which has a very specialized adaptation of dealing with this saltwater environment if you have a really close look at the leaves you 'll notice some fine salt crystals all over the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extrudes salt from its leaves so therefore getting rid of salt from the plant it also concentrates salt in the old leaves as well the river mangrove gets some pretty white flowers that have a smell of right bananas and animals such as bats are good pollinators for the river mangrove [Music] [Music] so down here we have a beautiful example of the iconic mangrove species the red mangrove they have these really iconic prop roots which are really obvious and distinguish them from some of the other mangrove species they give the name red mangrove from the red color on the roots and the other cool adaptation that they have these thick waxy leaves and that helps them to retain some some of the moisture their strategy for dealing with the saltwater environment is that they 're blocking salt uptake from their roots and also concentrating salt into the older leaves and they also have their seed pods which are called proper gills and they 're really long on this species kind of cigar shape and they actually quite vertical much like the yellow mangrove this is probably my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glassy leaves and they 're quite waxy that helps to retain water and their strategies or their adaptations for dealing with salt to exclude salt at the roots and also again concentrated in the old leaves and get rid of it that way one thing I really love about the orange mangrove is the way that their seed pods or potted you grow the kind of look a little off the puss Oh happen Papa Papa do you grow from the middle and then off and that 's like the red mangrove and the yellow mangrove will float around till it finds a suitable spot in the mud or the sand to grow a whole new mangrove it 's really cool hey that 's an impressive holiday isn 't impressive hello so this is in the gray mangrove once they get to this largest size we can develop hollows and really really really habitat absolutely there 's all kinds of species in the mangroves here that will utilize a piece of real estate like a tree hollow like this you might find snakes living in there you might find different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter so the most dominant species of mangrove in the boodle wetlands is the gray mango which is what you see all around us now this is a pioneer species and what that means it 's the first species of mango to grow in this area and they 've got pretty big and they can grow to a very very ripe old age the thing that you will notice about the gray mangrove is all these little tangle pencil like things sticking up from the mud and that 's part of its root system we call it no matter force they help the gray mangrove to breathe essentially to absorb oxygen and exchange gas even though they 're down in the mud so gets those roots up out of the mud to enable gas exchange [Music] so as you can see mangroves are really really important for the Wawa absolutely habitat but as well as that they 're a carbon sink they protect against erosion and they 're really important for filtering all kinds so how can we work together to protect mega roads we can act to keep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers and that 's take the reef or the sea and what that means is take if you can take three pieces of rubbish every day you 're going to be doing parts for helping a wetland like this well that 's it from us guys make sure you come out and experience the vendor wetland in particular work walk the tab will be dark and track here in such a hope to see you soon see you later [Music],"(-27.4704528,

Australia",992,hi everyone its Linda Brennan from echo Botanica here you 've probably met me at a brisbane council library sustainability program but seeing the libraries are closed today we 're going to help you live more sustainably at home by inviting you into my garden to see some of those fantastic edible flowers we grow here and the first one I 'd like to introduce you to is this gorgeous one here this is a sunflower they grow beautifully all through the year in our subtropical garden and I 'm very happy to have them in the vegetable patch see how they really attract the insects there 's bees hovering around them at any time of the day I use these for the sunflower seeds which are edible but I also use the petals in sunflower pesto it 's absolutely delicious let me pick one and add it to the basket now the next one we 're going to look at in the garden resembles a sunflower a little bit but I grow it because the insects love it so much and that is cosmos now there are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and cosmos cordifolia they 're all edible and look at them here these are some gorgeous pink cosmos they 're delicious there 's these little so furious here which are yellow and then finally we also grow these little ones in the garden they 're only small but these are called cosmos bright lights and all of these flowers are really very popular for people who are doing cake decorating or maybe even putting into Tov ears or on little cupcakes they 're gorgeous the petals of these drive very well so if you 'd like to harvest some of them you can do that and dry them off at a very low temperature where you can use those as a floral confetti later in the year it 's a very sweet the other thing with the cosmos is this the cosmos have a very dry little seed head once the flowers finished and when you crumble them up in your fingers like this you can either throw them back on the garden where they 'll happily grow again for you in another couple of months or you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season that you 'd like them to grow in so they give you a wonderful floral confection in your garden they 're gorgeous to grow and excellent for insects as well if you 've got a shady garden I 've got a couple of edible flowers that are perfect for you and the first one is Chinese lantern or a beauty line you can grow these in a pot or in the ground and when you use them you take out the central stamen and you can pipe the center of that with sweet or savory mousses it 's delicious pentas are a beautiful old-fashioned flower for shady gardens and they 'll bloom throughout the year the great thing about it though is that they 're edible when you pick a bunch of flowers which is a little head like this you get a whole series of tiny stars which look gorgeous on birthday cakes or in salads the thing to remember though is if you do want flushes of flowers throughout the year you need to take off all the dead heads that stimulates more flowering and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ones these are called dianthus and they 're related to carnations they 're also called pinks and they have a light flavor of clove they 're very popular for little cupcakes and also very popular to take off and dry because the little petals make a beautiful dried flower confetti which you can use on all sorts of applications both savory and sweet so there are two things to remember about these edible flowers and any edible flowers actually if you would like to have a long season of flowers and you haven 't picked all of them to eat you need to go back and deadhead your flowers so any flowers that have died just take those off throw them into the soil just nearby and that will extend the flowering season of your edible flowers the next thing is you need to fertilize them so these have had a good feed with manure in the soil before planting and I come through about every two to three weeks and give them a liquid feed of something like a seaweed and fish and that really keeps them looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat it 's really important that you grow them organically which means no fungicides and no artificial fertilizers you can grow them from seed as I 've done with these violas they 're just about ready to plant out into the garden now into full Sun or part shade they 'll thrive over winter and spring you can also purchase them in small punnets like I 've done with these violas take off any flowers that are on the plant before you sow them and also wash off the soil before you put it in the ground and then any fertilizer has been taken away from the root and these ones here these are corn flowers I love growing corn flowers because there 's such a beautiful show in the garden up to about half a meter tall these ones a pink white and blue and you will love having them in your desserts on your cakes and just growing in your garden so if you 've enjoyed today 's sustainability talk in my garden I 'm looking forward to seeing you for another one and back at the libraries very soon,"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"

4000, Australia",1950,welcome to winter in Queensland it 's a glorious time of year here on the coast things are flowering and lovely cool conditions for growing and we can grow lots of things that we can 't do at other times of year beautiful things like these Biola 's and pansies lots of other annuals people are planting bulbs and they 'll be up in the springtime and our spring starts usually towards the end of August and into very early September but of course it 's a time of year also when our plants can suffer from diseases and there are things we can do to control diseases in fact there are lots of things that we can do to prevent them but it 's important to remember that the organisms that cause disease things like fungi and a bacteria are in the air they 're in the soil they 're in water they 're round all the time they 're just waiting for the opportunity to take off and winter sometimes provides that opportunity and that 's because it 's a time of year when we often have heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination is perfect for some diseases to start to take off things particularly like powdery mildew it 's also a time when plants are going into more of a dormant phase the shrubs our fruit trees and that type of thing they can be slower growing at this time of year and that 's because the soil nutrients aren 't as readily available and so we do find things like our citrus trees and our pawpaws or even plants like our eggs Ora 's are slower growing because they can 't access the nutrients as readily out of the soil so these combinations coming together provide the ideal storm the bacteria and fungi are out there just waiting for their opportunity the conditions are right with moisture in the air in the early mornings cold overnight and also it can be a time when plants are more susceptible and that 's because they 're not getting the nutrition they can otherwise access from the soil and other times of year so it 's really important to make sure that your plants are getting the balanced nutrition that they need and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the winter time it 's quite important for us to particularly apply trace elements to put rock dust and those are the minerals onto the soil we need to cut back on the amount of nitrogen that we use but you know ingredients like potash in the soil and silica on to our plants are really important in controlling disease outbreaks but when you do have a disease outbreak there are plenty of things that you can use you might have on hand in the pantry to control them things like milk bicarbonate of soda or even leaves from some of the trees growing in your garden let 's go take a look vegetables that don 't get enough Sun in the wintertime really suffer from a lot of pests and disease problems and the diseases in particular are things like powdery mildew and other leaf spot diseases and a simple spray using bicarbonate soda can be a real boost to them and you can put it on preventatively so if you know the garden is going to suffer put it on in advance and you can retreat every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's necessary if I 'm using bicarbonate of soda in the vegetable garden I like to mix one tablespoon of by car and one teaspoon of soap in a two liter sprayer and that 's because some leafy vegetables are very sensitive to oil that we might otherwise put into the spray if we were using it for roses if you grow roses or fruit trees you might have heard a bordo spray in fact you might have even used it in the garden yourself well you can make your own Bordeaux is a really traditional spray used for fungal diseases and bacterial diseases it 's been used by gardeners for hundreds of years and it 's a combination of hydrated lime sometimes also known as slaked lime or builders lime and that 's combined with copper sulfate and it 's great for diseases like black spot on you mangoes for example other sorts of diseases that affect your pawpaws de Rosas we use it on Tomatoes we use it for peach lip curl a wide range of diseases and didn 't really we spray just in the wintertime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in the warm weather you do need to take a few precautions when you 're making up Bordeaux so make sure that it is hydrated lime not garden lime and you can 't then use that hydrated lime for general use in the garden it 's too strong and if you put it on your lawn and some gardeners I know have made the mistake of doing that you 'll find your worms will be packing up and heading to the next-door neighbor 's so use hydrated lime or builded slime only to make this Bordeaux mix you need to use it immediately so you make it up fresh and you use it straightaway I tend to soak and prepare the ingredients the night before and I 'll show you how to do that and we spray it readily over the trees and once during the growing season on our Tomatoes which of course in Queensland is generally in the winter time anyway so to make up two liters of Bordeaux mixture I 'm only going to make up a small amount you 'll need 20 grams of hydrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water let 's go and make some so here I 've dissolved my hydrated lime 20 grams in 1 litre of water and just clip that to dissolve overnight and here is the copper sulfate again the same amount 20 grams and I 've dissolved that in 1 liter of water and you need to make a small amount to mix up and use immediately and I 've used the traditional method of putting it in a stocking and leaving it to soak overnight so that actually dissolves easily through the water so here I 've got the hydrated lime that 's mixed in a liter of water and here I 've got the copper sulfate and it 's important to make sure that you mix the hydrated lime into the copper sulfate not the other way around wear gloves and in our protection and particular clothing when you 're doing this pour the mix together slowly small amount at a time and there you have it so here we have a traditional lime and copper sulfate mix or Bordeaux ready to use use it within a 24-hour period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pour it in carefully here through a funnel and then go and treat a few trees so Bordeaux is a great treatment for your mangos in the cooler months of the year to help controls black spot disease and even to control things like an Trek nose that terrible disease that hits your plants usually before flowering or at flowering when we get a wet winter season it 's growing a bay tree and you find it it gets a few disease problems then why not try using the Bordeaux on that during the winter time as well it 's a great treatment and it lasts actually for quite a long time doesn 't tend to wash off easily with watering or if we do get range this lemon has finished well its fruiting for this year and it 's just starting to come into flower so I 'm treating it to you with the Bordeaux as a great protection against disease for the coming season so we would normally treat after we 've harvested all our fruit on a success as well thorough spray all over the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches and of course don 't forget about your poor poor to miss friend your pawpaw concentrate on the new foliage that 's coming away from the center of the plant and also on any of the young fruit remember that this is a preventative spray so the leaves that have already been affected really it 's not going to help all that much on those leaves the black spots aren 't going to go away but it will help protect all that new foliage and that 's what you 're looking at to keep growing through the winter time that new crown and don 't forget to spray it on the green fruit they probably won 't mature until about September in Brisbane and you want to protect them from all of those right fruit diseases that they might otherwise get through the cooler months of the year a related mix that some gardeners might find easier to make up is a burgundy mix and this just combines copper sulfate and washing soda and it also is very useful against fungal diseases and mildew diseases biodynamic growers favor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know that silica is really important in plants and you can make your own spray by taking some dried Katarina leaves you need about sixty grams and I 've dried these for about five days and then just ball them up in the liter of water once that mix is cooled and you can see that the color is coming out into the water the cool mix can be diluted two tablespoons into a liter of water and you can spray that on just about anything in the garden to increase its silica level and therefore its disease resistance but if you 've just got a few pots why not try milk spray it 's nine parts water to one part full cream milk spray it liberally over the plants as often if you 'd like it 's great against major diseases as well and you can use this winter all summer so there you have it just remember that diseases are around in the air in the soil in the water all the time they 're just waiting for conditions to change for temperatures to drop or sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to reproduce they 're also looking for a susceptible plant so make sure you keep your plants healthy and choose the most disease resistant varieties use compost and trace elements and don 't overdo the nitrogen fertilizer in your plants because that will make them softer and more susceptible to diseases attacking them when diseases do occur have some simple preventative measures on hand so you can use your Bordeaux mixed in the winter time your burgundy mix you can use your bicarbonate soda or the simple milk spray really to keep most things under control and of course if the plant is subjected to diseases over and over again think about whether or not it 's actually suitable for your climate next time I 'll be back telling you about tree pastes and they 're great for preventing borås and generally keeping trees healthy in the garden,"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"
AUS,QLD,Brisbane City Council,Brisbane City Council,https://www.youtube.com/c/BrisbaneCityCouncil1,Saving wet seeds with Annette McFarlane,X_GUT7BppT0,20200511,960.079,"Brisbane City QLD 4000, Australia",2918,hello I 'm in at McFarland welcome to this session on saving whet seeds so wet seeds are simply seeds with the flesh around them and we have to remove that flesh generally to save seeds if we want to store them for a long period of time now what does this flesh do around the seed if we look at something like a delicious pawpaw of course if you 've ever had problems with bats or possums eating you 'd fruit you 'd know that it 's so attractive to animals and this is a way that the seed is dispersed so the flesh around the seed often is an aid to dispersal of the seed and it performs a very important function sometimes of course the flesh is so bitter it 's meant to deter animals so nothing eats the seed of my David 's and plums here because it is so bitter one bite out of it and the animal just leaves it alone the other thing about the flitter and the seed of course is that it drops to the ground the fruit drops to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an immediate supply of compost ready for the seed to germinate but also within that flesh and within the material surrounding the seeds there are natural chemical inhibitors and a lot of the things that produce wet seeds are often annual crops if we think about something like a tomato so you might have experienced trying to grow tomatoes but just putting a tomato into the ground and it just takes ages to come up however if you 've thrown Tomatoes into your compost and you just use that compost then to plant at something else you get a mass supply of tomato seedlings coming up just randomly without you doing anything and that 's because the natural inhibitors in that flesh around the seed are designed to stop the seed germinating because these plants don 't want to necessarily germinate straight away especially if something like a tomato it comes to the end of the summer autumn fruiting season and it 's going naturally into winter then it 's not a good time for that seed to germinate in the majority of climates and so the composting process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right come September usually the sieve just germinate so that 's the same process that 's happening in your compost however when we want to store our seeds we can 't have that flesh around them and also sometimes we want the seed to germinate straight away if the weather conditions are right so washing the seed is a way of also removing those natural chemical inhibitors and it 's also a way of making sure that the seed doesn 't rot when we try and store it for a period of time now some wet seeds do need to be sown immediately and they don 't store if they 're dried out but others as I 'll show you can be dried and saved for one or two or more seasons and will still remain viable so it takes something like the pawpaw here this one 's absolutely filled with seeds it 's really really delicious they 're lovely at this sort of time of year towards the end of the summer into autumn because I 've had all that lovely summer sun-eater to sweeten them usually a winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeds but if you make a comparison here between the seeds if I scrape some of these seeds out and just put them on the plate here you can see that they 're covered with a lot of flesh and that flesh you can sow those seeds straight away but it 's very difficult to store the seeds for any length of time with all that flesh around because the seed just rots so here are some seeds that I 've actually washed and you can see when you look closely at them that they almost look like these dried currants and so that 's what you 're aiming for in removing that flesh from the outside if you want to store those seeds now what I do with mine to help removal of that flesh is I actually take the seeds out and I ferment them for a few days or a week and you 'll find that that flesh will wash off fairly easily all you have to do is to pop the seeds into a sieve with some water you can be fairly abrasive pushing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ferment the seeds for as I say a week or so or a bit longer you can do it in a bowl or in a jar and you 'll find that the flesh comes away more easily and that 's the case with a lot of fleshy seeds to remove that flesh on the outside soaking and fermenting the seeds is a good idea it also means that you kill a lot of pest problems by fermenting the seed so the city is actually cleaner in the end and free of things like mites and perhaps even fruit fly and other things like that that may be in the flesh surrounding the seed itself one thing also with pores remember if you can to try and get a pawpaw that 's local to your area so yes it 's easy to buy a pore pore and grow the seed of it but that doesn 't mean that that purple will perform in your climate so if you live in Brisbane and you get a purple that comes from Cannes chances are that will require a different set of conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that 's grown in Brisbane so the trick is with purples if you find a great variety growing locally ask the gardener if you can have some seeds and then you 'll be able to grow into like this as well when it comes to other fleshy crops things like tomatoes really popular for seed saving so with tomatoes the thing to remember is that tomatoes need to be really really ripe and that 's the case as you can see with the purple that I 've talked about so these little cherry tomatoes are really quite softer they 're probably a bit beyond the stage of really putting them on a cracker biscuit biscuit or putting them in a salad there but they 're perfect for seed saving so you can save from small Tomatoes or from large fruit and tomatoes you can save ones from the supermarket or you can save varieties that you 've grown yourself and again you can see when I have fermented and then washed the seed thoroughly and let it to dry it 's quite different to the seed that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how this is really covered in a sort of jelly like substance and the great thing about seed saving from tomatoes is you can save the seed but if you want you can still eat the rest of the tomatoes not too soft so we need to get rid of a lot of that stuff if you want to store the seeds for any length of time and also to give them away to friends or just share them with seed saver networks now a lot of people will just take a tomato and put it on a piece of paper and actually squash it out leave it to dry and then save this it 's that way and that 's fine if you just want to do a few yourself at home then that 's perfectly acceptable and that will store for 12 months or more when you go to plant the seeds you can just tear the paper up into pieces and then plant them where you want them to go I always make sure that to try to name the piece of paper if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one variety of seeds from the other so tomatoes are really pretty easy but if you want to save them for the longer term it 's really important to make sure you get rid of that flesh and again that flesh has that natural chemical inhibitor so if I was to take this tomato and just plant it into the ground I might wait at least 12 months before the tomato would come up however if I clean lessly didn 't implant it it 'll be up in seven to ten days so certainly there are some advantages here when it comes to eggplants size is not an indication of the maturity of the plant in terms of its seed raising collection ability so with an eggplant like this a small one you might think well that you know it 's not going to be ready for seed saving but it depends on the variety because they come in all different shapes and sizes and you might think this giant eggplant here would be perfect for seed saving because the fruit is so large but when I open it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these seeds in here huh are really really tiny I mean you can hardly even see where they are and that means that this really doesn 't have any seeds that are worth saving they just on here look like tiny little dots whereas this is the size that seed should be so it 's really quite large and we need to let our eggplants change color regardless of the variety it generally goes to a sort of a yellow really straw color and by then it 's ready to save the seeds from it so it really needs to be collapsed and completely unusable before you start to look at saving the seeds from it and of course remember what we say about seed saving whether it 's saving seeds from you know wet seed saving or dry seed saving whether it 's from these fleshy things or from the pea or a bean it always is that you save the best and you eat the rest so always pick the best largest luscious most disease-resistant fruit for your seed saving so just like the egg plant when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size that we would normally perhaps pick and eat a cucumber this size or smaller and if I could take a scraping out of the scent of this you can see the cavities for where the seed is starting to form and there but virtually there 's nothing there 's no seeds and so if you 're buying a cucumber or you 're growing cucumbers yourself at home really they have to be fully mature which means they 'll be enormous and they 'll turn yellow and when they 've gone really mushy and they 're they smell disgusting that 's the stage at which you 're ready to save seed because the seed has to be really quite large and make a comparison between a packet of seed or see if you say previously and you 'll find that you know there 's quite a difference in that the seeds quite large and also oh I find even with cucumbers that probably 50% of the seed is really flat and empty and you can see that when you 're saving seed and so probably only 50% of the seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway so don 't worry too much when it comes to drawing out your seed so when you 've washed them and you 've cleaned them in your bowl and they 're all ready to go what I find the easiest thing to do I actually put them on a tea towel now you can put them on newspaper or any other sort of paper a lot of people do use paper I find though the seeds are very hard to get off so I just take so if this is filled with seeds drop it onto here and spread the seeds out on the tea towel and then I find once they 're dry I can actually just scrape the seeds off they come off really easily some people also use baking paper so the seeds going to stick to that so that 's another alternative for you and finally I 'm often asked can I take seeds from a citrus that I 'd got and grow it from seed well the answer is yes and no citrus generally are grafted and they grafted for particular reasons if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get disease resistance of the root stock which is conferred into the mature plant that can grow across a wide range of climates and salt types so there are really good reasons why we graft citrus and so if we grow something at citrus you know perhaps we 've got a lemon and we take seeds out of it and grow those seeds they will germinate but they won 't come up anything like the parent plant they 'll be completely different they 'll be thorny and the flesh might be you know sour and not exactly like the parent plant itself but there are some plants that we can grow some citrus that we can grow from seed so most of us at home grow Tahitian limes which is this one here obviously you can 't grow that from seed because it doesn 't actually have any seeds in it but there are other limes plenty of them too so this is what we call a West Indian lime it 's a smaller line and it has lots of seeds inside it so it 's a really true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do find that many nurseries grafted but you can grow your own from seed and you can see that the seeds inside here are really quite large and the only thing with these is you need to make sure that you 're sowing them fresh so I 've left these a little bit of juice and I 'll sew them fresh but rather than letting them dry out in any way so you can 't keep them that 's what the foliage looks like so it does look like a normal one it 's a little bit more quickly and it grows us a nice relatively small plant so you can grow that particular line so that 's the true West Indian line but you can 't obviously grow this one from seed without any seed in it other limes that you can grow this is what we call a ring Pula lime and this is actually a hybrid lime and it 's a cross between a citron a Mandarin and an orange and there 's also this thing here which is you recognize the figure 8 shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lime called the false lime sometimes called the macro climb and you can see this is the seedling I 've just pulled out of the ground just now so they actually just come up from seed underneath the parent plant so you can collect the seed if you want to in the same way keep it moist and sew it and you can grow those from seed now can you grow a finger line the native finger line well if you happen to have a permit to collect native seeds from the bush and some of our commercial nurseries and Bush keep groups do you can grow traditional limes in that way from seed but they 're variable and the ones that we grow in nurseries usually are selected hybrids like this fruit here which is from a sunrise line you can grow those from seed but when you grow them from seed they come up like this so they look really really prickly and they 're not likely to bear the same sort of fruit as the original parent plant but you can grow them from seed and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might select one plant so one tray of seeds one plant that has similar foliage to the parent plant which would be an indication that it 's likely to have inherited more of the desirable characteristics this is one that I 've run from seed it 's been about I don 't know an 18-month process to get it to this stage so in Willick beer the same or better fruit than its parent plant who knows it 's all a bit of experiment but that 's the fun of actually saving and collecting and sowing your own seeds so why not give it a go it 's great fun I 'm sure you don 't enjoy,"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"

Wall,r5bhzZl7pKI,20200625,908.639,"Brisbane City QLD 4000, Australia",2204,hi I 'm Caitlin and welcome to part 2 of our upcycle gardening workshops for children this is my son Ned who 's going to be joining in the workshop today and helping me with it today we 're using the sort of things that nearly all of us have in our recycling box and this is the sort of thing we 're going to make this is why I made yesterday we made however would like to make his into a fish so it lends itself to a face beautifully in this space however there 's no reason why you have to go with a human face it would like to be a fish big kids you can do these two self little kids you 'll need somebody to help you it 's cut the top off the milk bottle up here and any pair of sharp scissors will do that quite easily now I don 't wipe that you 've washed you milk bottle first we might end up finding this job gets a bit messy and smelly do give you a good breakfast this part makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it today for painting this one put that aside for me [Music] now before I hand this over to Ned what we 're going to do is hang it up it 's a lot easier to work on if it 's hung up so you can see we 've got some string here to hold it up now to do that I 'm going to put four little holes around they got to do it a fair way from the top because if you accidentally go too far you don 't want it to cut all the way up now again this is a job for a broker and it 's a pretty easy job now that we 've got four hands we 've got some string we 're just going to thread the string through the hole to be able to hang out [Music] string it through a couple of times just for extra security so that the string doesn 't really slip run the string below to his home [Music] now if I was doing a face like that one there then that would be the only cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd watched a fish we 've decided we 've already had a chat about how this is going to work and I 've decided that we would like to put some fins on our fish to make it a bit more fishy so I am going to make some extra cuts in this milk bottle to be able to add some fins and we 've already cut out some pieces of plastic we 're using plastic not paper because it needs to be able to get wet but it can be treated so it won 't look like this and we just used old trays that you would have in the recycling so once again these are projects that you can do just with things that you have at home already so we don 't want you having to go and buy new materials because that 's not then what color would you like the fish to be alright so how do we make orange if we haven 't got orange paint that 's exactly right red and yellow together will make orange so if we mix some red and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make skin called paint if you wanted a skin color like this it 's pretty orange really isn 't it so is red and yellow with more red than yellow and a little white you can add a little bit of blue to make it a darker skinned or okay now we 've got our four pieces like this if I bundle that like this and tie it up we can hang it here on this one I 've already now the whole thing is actually a little bit easier to work on if we can weight it down later whole thing 's a lot easier to work on if we weight it down so Ned would you like to just add a small handful of rocks into the bottle please now the reason that we put some rocks into the bottom gives it a little weight so don 't people steady forth few more and it also helps with drainage so that the nunchaku or flow to the bottom now see when I wanted this one we 're gonna unscrew the cap to that where you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all comes to the bottom now you can see with those rocks in its standing nice and straight to make some slits to put our fins in we 've got one tail fin and two side fins here I 'll put a little slit on each side about this height you reckon there yeah little hole down just enough to be able to hope you can see we have a flap here that flap goes to the inside like that now while we have nothing in it we can put some sticky tape or pieces a bit of glue or something inside to hold that together so I 'm gonna get need to do that job need we actually have some tile glue on the floor if you do you want to grab that bucket so you can glue that in and now not everybody has tile blue you could just use some table whatever you have this is believed if it 's laying down flat to police slip into it so I probably should have done this step before I hung it up however that 's alright and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want now once this whole thing comes together it will be held together nicely with the soil inside of it so which will really help but it will all be painted no need what I 'm going to get you to do is scoop up a little bit of this tile blue from the bucket with this and put it inside I can 't even press those down you right to do that okay and then we 've got a towel one to do on the back as well and you 'll see how the shape of the fish comes together but you can choose any animal that suits you or more simply just do a face like this one now in this case what we 've done here is we 've used some material wrapped around the top that just makes it fun this is a piece of old dress that I 've cut up and some earrings that I 've added just for a bit of bling and a bit of fun it 's entirely up to you how you want to decorate yours that 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some ivy now this will hang down really nicely like hair in this particular one but you don 't have to choose something that hangs down and you can choose something that sticks straight up with your line [Music] [Music] [Music] we 're going to use because we want to make orange so we need a big square nice big squirt of yellow but I also found some silly because we are adding in a bit of silver just for a bit of extra fun to see what happens making a little bit shiny for I paint it or what are you going to get painting and had fun with painting the fish when he has finished painting doesn 't mean look at drawing or painting your eyes you can see it 's highly happy [Music] let 's look at some of the plant choices we 've chosen mint because we like eating it it 's a lot of fun in your project if you can add notes that you can eat however edible plants don 't always lend themselves to where we hang these things it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit shady so the meat won 't get enough light to grow that 's one we all hang somewhere outside where it gets a lot more Sun and the mint gets enough light to do well the great thing about these plants is we can control how wittle ' dry they are meat likes a lot of water so we don 't need to open the bottle to drain it very often ivy on the other hand likes to be just a little on the dry side so I hope you have to rain out a little bit more often this myth will grow up and then it will cascade now it probably won 't get only beat the peak med we 'll be constantly nibbling at it and it won 't get the chance to get too big but that 's all part of the fun as well now looking at this one here how do we care for plants in this planter here I haven 't yet watered this one in I 'm gonna do that now and show you here we add our water so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along poppy when we are flipping we only need a little bit not very much you can use won 't we Punky 's tea or anything like that that you have in see the colorful water when we 're putting plants and entertainers we usually break the roots when we put them in it was squishing and shoving to make them go in so we want to encourage those roots to grow back and putting a little bit of sea salt is a good way to do that now these planters will get a bit heavy and as you do I 'm filling them up with water there 's a lot of space in here I 've taught to 3 liter milk products so there 's lots of room so I 'm just carefully and gently a few drips a little bit of mess which is why we 've got an old table bot so it doesn 't matter how much mess we made and you can see it takes quite a lot of water when this water has sucked all the way through we can let drain out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got too much in there if we were to leave too much water in the bottle it would get too wet and our plant would rot sorry to undo it just unscrew it just a little bit not enough for everything to fall out I 've got a container here to catch the drips so obviously wherever you hang this it does matter that you can empty it out pick it up and take it out so I too won 't drain the water out move it outside it doesn 't really matter but we can just leave that open now for a few minutes to be able to just fully drain through I 've got a tin underneath these I think catch that more during these and elsewhere but you can have a lot of fun experimenting with the different plants that you 've got in your garden to put into your head seeing what 's in the old nobody wears anyway remember to ask permission first never use something that you don 't have to do yes but that can also be fun to put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat to paint at some point so that it doesn 't get too worn off I 'll get around to that but again have fun with your planter and remember whichever plan you choose you 've got to think about whereabouts it 's going to go how much Sun does it need because we have a lot of soil spacing here we can grow things that like to get quite big so for example what we 've used here with our shoes in the shoe by putting it in here it 's got lots and lots of space to fill up with roots and the bigger and stronger those roots are the bigger a plate is gonna be and healthier and happier it 's going to be so ask your mom and dad for help have a lot of fun making up your own creature your own style design and explore what you can do with different plants in them and we 're going to go and give Ned some time to finish this once he 's finished painting it want some nice big eyes and decorate it a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recycled head later kids,"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"

Australia",1573,hi everyone welcome to Fairfield library my name is Colleen it 's lovely to see you again such a shame that you can 't come to the library and join us here for our storytime babies and toddlers times but that 's why I 'm here talking to you never because we 're going to share some of our favorite songs and rhymes together what we always do before we start our sessions is to do our children 's acknowledgement to country I 'm sure you know this but it 's very easy to follow and goes like this here is the land here is the sky here are my friends and here am I really easy and you know what at the moment it 's very important that we keep ourselves healthy and one of the ways that we can do that keeping ourselves and our friends and our families healthy is by washing our hands so it 's very important that we keep our hands very clean would you like to do the hand washing song with me it 's very simple we need to wash the tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands and in the insides of their hands as well and it goes like this wash your dirty hands wash your dirty hands rub and scrub and wrap and scrub wash your dirty hands wash your dirty hands wash your dirty hands a rub and scrub and rub and scrub wash your dirty hands well then good job all right let 's start off with our first song because our hands are nice and clean now let 's do a nice hand ride and this one I 'm

roll them roll them just like this shake them shake them shake them shake one little kiss no your hands nice and warm I should think that would be we 're going to do a nice little rhyme insect in the garden it 's a butterfly so how many gorgeous colors and we 're going to do this rhyme without two hands open wide like this and then can you wiggle your thumbs and join them together and then we have our own butterfly and the Rhine goes like this butterfly wings go fluttering bye down to the ground and up to the sky butterfly wings can tickle your nose butterfly wings can tickle your toes butterfly is high slow great big butterfly hug to say hello well done good job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands open like this wiggle them together join your thumbs together butterfly wings fluttering by down to the ground up to the sky butterfly wings can tickle your nose butterfly wings can tickle your toes butterflies hi hi slow and a great big butterfly hug to say hello boo well done and another insect that 's in her garden are bees we like to stay away from them but they have a very important job don 't they in our Gardens collecting honey and making honey so we 're going to start off without bee hive rhyme so can you told your thumbs together and fold your fingers over the top it goes like this here is the big hive where are the bees hidden away where nobody sees watch them come creeping and they 're hired we go one two three four five and maybe if your brother or sister or your growing up is near you you can tickle all over let 's do it one more time hands open type your thumbs in your other fingers over the top here we go here is the be high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them come creeping out of their hive one two three four five and well done times that boozing makes my tongue tingle just because a bit money doing that another rhyme this one is going to do some cutting up their hands and then some tapping on our knees can you do that together John goes like this an old man oh dear let 's find out what happens to him this old man he played one he played knick-knack on my tongue with a knick-knack patty-whack give a dog a bone this old man came rolling home now we 're going to tap our shoe this old man he played two he played knick-knack on his shoe with a Knick Knack paddy wack give a dog a bone this old man came rolling home three we 're going to tickle Andy 's and this old man he played three he played knick-knack on my knee with a Knick Knack paddy wack give a dog a bone this old man came for we 're gonna knock on the door really loud on my door with a Knick Knack paddy wack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home [Music] we 're clapping and tapping can be a bit confusing but you have to practice don 't win I 'm all right one of my other favorite songs and I think this is one of your favorite songs too is a song about five little ducks I brought five ducks along and they 've all got their own special colour this one has a feather that 's the colour of red and this one has the feather that 's the colour yellow this one has a colour orange and this little ducky is green and last a little ducky is blue you got a favorite color my favorite color is red but you might like one of the other ones let 's have a count one two three four five little ducks can show me your five little ducks on your hand like this one two three four five five little ducks went out

QLD 4000, Australia",1978,hello I 'm Kate wall and welcome to part 3 about upcycling gardening workshops for children this is my son Ned who 's gonna help out with this workshop this one today is all about what we can do with old teens so once again this is coming out of the recycling this is not things we need to go the shopping bag we 're going to use what we already have at home so I 've got a collection of different old tins here sorry never blocking your face a little bit and some different things this one is all rusty and dirty that 's a pretty old one these cans will rust eventually but at the moment they 're nice and shiny this one so using them to decorate a tomb [Music] we just did a quick job of giving it some paint so this is just a quick cut now the thing with all of these is I 've already put holes in for drainage this one needs some holes putting holes in is pretty simple because these chains are home you can do that during that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about what sort of circus we 're putting on you can experiment whatever you find some old pieces the material like was used on this planet ahead awesome old costume jewelry that mum doesn 't want anymore could all be used to decorate your damn house ask mum what she doesn 't want and see what 's being thrown away so then what do we do we wait for it to dry it 's glue is well dry so I can plant into that one this paint is dry to touch but because was only painted this morning that 's not yet hard and that will scratch very easily by tomorrow that will be much safer to plant into without scratching a variety of different things that we can plant into these and we can think about just like with everything what sort of plant do we want to grow in our tent and where do we want the team to sit remember some plants like shade think about that this one will make a lovely indoor plant so I 'm going to keep this one for an indoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very happy to be out doing these two here I also want they 're perfectly tough enough at these finishes once the finish is dry or hard this one here because we 're stuck things on to the metal it shades the measurements drops the metal getting too hot so that 's right in the Sun what nerds doing here is digging up all over these two and these rocks these rocks are going to help keep the roots inside that team nice and cool so we can very plants in this one they like to grow in the Sun but to have cool roots and for that we 've got some Asian greens so we 've got a mixture of different plants that we 're going to get busy planting into our teams and then we can talk about how this is a mixture of four different Asian greens in here you 're the toast of one of these and satellite yeah so if we put a couple of Asian art in that 'll be something that is fun to [Music] enjoy this is this is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive not the one that 's really cheap the reason for that is we want it to be really good quality so it looks after our plans now we could just put one plant hurt in here and that means that this path of four which is four different ones however I 'm going to squeeze in two different ones [Music] now I 've pushed those in a little bit now a little bit more potting mix you have to make sure it 's all topped up and these are all tucked in nicely we don 't want the roots sticking out we don 't want oxygen spaces their air gaps around the roots we want them all tucked in just like we put in your plant a bit and tucking it into baby pea and that 's that one plant it will say phase 2 to plant into net1 when he 's finished let 's look at how we go putting the carboy into this one and again we fill out here not with absolute quality potting mix and this is something that if I don 't have at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to grow some of these things from seed you don 't necessarily have to buy the plants you can plant seeds in these tents and grow seeds now not as much this time because as you can see this culantro has already got a bigger root system that we 've got to squeeze in and it 's pot it 's bigger than the tin so we 've got to figure out how we make that fit in and to do that I 'm just going to tease away some of the extra dirt around the bottom like this to make this fit into our team you see how that 's all scraping away the extra you can see all these roots are looking really healthy here aren 't they coming up and now root ball is much smaller and will fit into our team around so that plant roots are nicely tucked a bit in there tap it down a little bit some roots sticking out there they need to be tucked in and put to bake nicely you don 't want the plant to wobble in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there we go so we 've got these three teams now all plant it up and ready but they need to get watered in my home it 's disappearing in the dirt here we will plant meds for you tomorrow when the so to water these in we need once again to think about what we 're doing they 've got holes in the bottom when I put water in that water 's going to flow out so I am to water above so we can cancel it once again I 've put a little bit of sea salt into my water the reason for that is we 're showing you the orange juice dad should I show you this side so you can see that the color of the water would probably be a bit stronger but for now that 'd be doing what oopsies hold of it the first time when watering our new paint it helps the roots grow strong and fill up your new pot we want to make sure we water the whole thing so we keep putting the water in until I can feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom make sure that 's nicely tucked in and in a minute that 's going to come out the bottom there it goes now that there 's water coming at the bottom we know with what enough and I can sip that down and let that finish draining out before I put that anywhere else and I can do the same with these ones give them a nice big line of water and then I know I 've got enough any and the water starts coming out the holes in the bottom there we go now this one here I don 't want to sit in here because I don 't want the paper to get wet so I 'm actually going to sit this one and then this one here I 'll do this one to get wet how do we know how to look after our tens how do we know if our plant is happy or sad we now have plants happy if it 's standing up like this if all our leaves are lying down flat it 's not happy I think we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one eat that excellent if all that leaves a laying flat needs water we want it standing up and happy but we don 't want too much water which is why we water it we wait until it stops coming out the bottom and then we can put it back and then we 'll know that our plant is happiness this one here when it gets very dry the leaves will fall off those there 's another important trick in knowing how to care for our plants and that remains all plants whether it 's our shoes at Tim 's or our planter head and that 's your finger the magic finger that told you if your plant needs to be water stick your plant your fever all the way into your pot plant and pull it out my fingers come out quite juicy hasn 't it I can feel that the ground is wet it doesn 't need watering now I 'll use this finger you know this one hasn 't been a wheel check I 'll stick my finger all the way in and it doesn 't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one needs water so that 's one of the ways we know our plant needs water and you should check your plants every few days to check if they need water you 'll get used to knowing how often this one probably will need water every 2 or 3 days this one will probably only need use once a week because with these big fleshy leaves it can hold water itself now if we 're picking lots of pieces of this plant to eat then we need to make sure we look after the plant very very well and don 't let it dry out because it needs to grow lots of new leads quickly this one here is perfect just as it is so it doesn 't need to grow fast but this one wants to grow fast so we 've really look back to that plant which means keeping an eye on it and making sure we don 't let it dry out because we want to eat it that 's another reason don 't let it dry out because doesn 't taste very nice once the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well watered if we make sure we leave it somewhere you can see there 's still a bit of water dribbling out onto the table where the water can dribble away just fine then we know we don 't over watering the plant with the okay give it plenty of sunshine and the fertilizer in the potting mix should be enough combined with the sea salt in your water to grow some beautiful food in a 10 that you have decorated yourself with things that would otherwise go in the bin lots of great options for you to try at home so why don 't you try making a planter head from an old milk bottle or you can use any sort of bottle you could use a juice bottle instead if you liked maybe plate it up some old shoes maybe decorate an old tin maybe you put another idea in mind something else that you found in the recycling bin or the rubbish bin that you could put plant into and then have fun

QLD 4000, Australia",1341,hi everybody my name is Jason my name is Luke and we 're from in Tripoli library so today we 're going to start with children 's acknowledgement to country so that starts with here 's the land here 's the sky here are my friends and here I shall we do that one again here 's the land here 's the sky here are my friends and here am I so something we 'd like everybody to keep in mind today as we 're doing our rhymes and stories and songs is that children learn best from talking playing and singing with us and this can be done at any time anywhere at home in the park in the car all sorts of places and of course here at the library when you come with your children to sing with us of course you can visit the library at the moment so we 're going to do our virtual toddler time so the first song I 'd like us to do Jason is a familiar tune with familiar actions but for a lot of people these might be unfamiliar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toes but in the yagura ' language which is the language of the yoga of people who have lived around the Western area of what is now Brisbane for thousands and thousands of years let 's give it a go first we should probably teach people what the words are so we 've got gone our head gig our shoulders knees and Idina our toes and of course for the second verse we 're not allowed to touch our faces we 're gonna use our beer to demonstrate we 've got meal eyes been on ears damn boar mouth and Maru nose I do apologize if I 'm not pronouncing all the words absolutely correctly let 's give it a go Tina Tina Giga bone and Tina gonna [Music] be no damn tomorrow gum Giga bone and inner one and dinner very good let 's try it one more time because as we all know repetition is a great way to learn new songs and new words all right Gargi Capone and Gina born antenna dumb geek opponent in opponent Dina niobium Dan Boren muru gum geek opponent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that song at home try it out and we look forward to doing that one with you when we reopen what would you like to do next Jason we can do would everyone like to do Incy Wincy Spider certainly let 's do Incy Wincy Spider and one thing to remember with Incy Wincy Spider it has a lot of really great actions in it and if we include actions with our rhymes and songs those pros provide meaning and context to the vocabulary that you 're learning so let 's give it a go so we check what 's in the spout let 's see what 's in the spell shall we so we 're going to do now Incy Wincy Spider Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout down came the rain and washed poor Incy out out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain so Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again I think there 's a second spider in that spout a little sick and spot on shall we help that spotter get out of the spout let 's give it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the rain and washed poor Incy out out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain so Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again wonderful stuff for our next set of songs I 'm going to use them to help me tell a story this story is a dream time story which is thousands and thousands of years old this particular version is told by the goon I corner people of the East Gippsland area of Victoria and if any of you have ever been to the town of Warwick there 's actually a statue of this fellow tiddalick the frog ' so do it did have a short retelling of this story and we 'll have a couple of songs as well so once upon a time there was a frog called tiddalick tiddalick was a very very greedy frog and because he lived in a hot climate he was a very very thirsty frog one day tiddalick was so thirsty he drank all the water in the Billabong he drank all the water in the creek he drank all the water from the rivers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain until there was no more water left and a very very fat waterlogged tillich now of course all of the other animals that lived nearby had no more water to drink so they all decided to get together and have a parade in front of Tillich to try to make him laugh and open his mouth to get all the water out so they could have a drink again so for this part we 're going to sing a song to the tune of frère Jacques Coeur which is barramundi the barramundi was the first animal and of course with rivers and things dried up he was suffering pretty badly by tillich drinking all the water what starts like this mundi mundi car cartoon car cartoon EMU and koala Hugh and koala kangaroo kangaroo we try that one more time Mundy barramundi cockatoo cockatoo EMU and koala in um koala kangaroo kangaroo so look that made us laugh Jason but it didn 't work on tiddalick tiddalick still had his mouth firmly shut and all of the water inside him until finally the animal that made him laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called naba nom the eel so he 'll came along again a water-dwelling creature who was suffering from not having any water to swim in and the eel started twisting itself into knots and all sorts of hilarious shapes which finally made tiddalick laugh out loud laughing out loud and all of the water started pouring out from his mouth and filling up the Billabong 's and streams so that all of the animals could finally have a drink look at all the water coming down for the animals to drink from and that 's the story of tiddalick the frog ' one of the animals that didn 't get a mention in our story which is famous for its laughs is the kookaburra would you like to sing kookaburra sits in the old gum tree kookaburra sits in the old gum tree merry merry king of the bush is he laugh kookaburra gay your life must be one more time do you reckon one was on a virus it 's in the old gum tree Mary Mary King the bushes he laughed kookaburra laugh kookaburra gay your life must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for today I think we can do one more song as a farewell the nice calming song and we 're going to do twinkle twinkle little star let 's get out fingers up we 've met a little star here so if you don 't have the star at home you can just use your fingers just like that and reach up to the sky we 're ready one two three twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you all right thank you all so much for joining us today as we deliver our virtual online toddler time session we can 't wait to see you all back in the library as soon as we can all right,"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"

QLD 4000, Australia",1214,hi I 'm Kate Ward and I am here today doing some it 's videos welcome to gardening for children for Brisbane City Council libraries so this is for kids for all ages and their parents or caregivers to join in it 's going to be a three-part series we 're going to do three different upcycling projects using things you find around the house old shoes tin cans and even milk bottles we 're going to look at how we put these projects together but we 're also going to look at how we choose what sort of plant we put in it and how to care for the plant that we put in it now this is a three part series and the first one we 're going to do is about shoes and most families have some old shoes in the cupboard if not try your next one over somebody 's will have old shoes that they 're wanting to throw out I 've raided my next-door neighbor 's here these shoes here you seem to be in pretty good Nick however at the moment all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new home for things much right now so why not use them in the garden something like a sneaker here has lots of space inside to put soil and it looks great with something nice in it like this [Music] like this one all of these holds all the dirts gonna fall out if you can 't pick the dirty plant grabbing it so this shoot is Noble we 'll throw that one aside but this collection here is absolutely fine these old ones here were actually in the rubbish bin and this is why you can see the bottom is quite broken they 're past being able to wear however what I have done and what I encourage you to do is pour some water into the chute if the water leaks out you 've already got the holes you need for drainage if it doesn 't leak out you need to drill some holes and I have drilled a hole in it I know what a little hole but we need a hole and I 'm also I 've done the same with these ones to draw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do need to drill a hole quite carefully because after all choosing it to be worn on our feet there 's lots of layers together immature so it can be hard to make a hole and you need to do it safely with a drill now looking at these two different shoes they have very different spaces for the amount of soil we can fit it this one 's only got a little space for soil this one much bigger and because this section here has a lot of space in it we can even put some soil here now in this one I have already put some soil and put this is Swedish I 'm into debate well I think we could put in a bit more soil so that I can also plant this spider plant now with gardening and craft projects and much more fun if you can make a mess when you 're putting soil into your chute push it right down so it fills out the chute that one there is done and if we do a batch with this one we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the toe somewhere that 's not too hot these two plants are both common indoor plants they like a little bit of shape they don 't like to be out in the foster so or even inside these ones are both fine inside next to your wardrobe if you want to so long as they 're not getting a full Sun so they 're getting good bright light so you can see how that soil we 're putting into this chute is plenty of room you 'll see in a minute it 's not so much room in that one now that I 've got some soil in I can work its plan this is a cutting piece that we 've taken from the garden it 's tiny little root starting along with stem here so this is ready to grow into a new plant once I tuck it there into that shoe nice and securely that 's ready to go this one here is also a baby plant with some new roots coming that 's come off the parent plant so this was one that I could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great cheap easy way to do it and there 's a pair of shoes this pair on the other hand don 't have anywhere near as much space so watch as I fill them up now it doesn 't take anywhere near as much soil to fill the chute look at those toes are full already now I can fill this space here because it will hold it there if I put the soil up here obviously it just runs down so that 's not gonna work perhaps go down the bottom there fill both shoes you 'll see what fun things we can do there 's still plants there 's always a plant for every situation but there are certainly plants that we can use to grow in shoes that don 't have a lot of sort of space and these are succulents the reason we use succulents like that is because they 're happy to dry out where you trying to have very much soil space this all gets very dry very quickly so these are tough plants that don 't mind drying out a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're nice succulent planters now these ones do like a lot of Sun so these ones you can put outside on the stairs where they get some sunshine they will still need watering all of these shoes will need watering every few days probably because they can dry out fast because these ones are inside they won 't dry out as fast but these ones every couple of days just a little bit of now do remember when you 're watering we 've put a hole in the bottom of these so it will dribble out now I haven 't put enough in here yet to dribble out it goes but it will leave a wet patch so keep popping indoors make sure you take them outside of what the leaders think to water them so you don 't leave a mess on the floor that 's our first project done go and see what old shoes and our permission don 't use shoes that dad wants to wear to work tomorrow see what I 'll choose you 've got what fun you can have creating your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this series well we 'll be looking at how to make a planter kids,"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"
AUS,QLD,Brisbane City Council,Brisbane City Council,https://www.youtube.com/c/BrisbaneCityCouncil1,Seed sowing with Annette McFarlane,ZfIY4Gg7II0,20200511,667.18,"Brisbane City QLD 4000, Australia",1946,hello I 'm in it McFarland thanks for joining me today I 'm talking about seed sowing seeds you 're a really economical way to get new plants because you can often get quite a lot in a small pack and once you learn a few tips and tricks you 'll be having great success with germination so a few basics to start with you might be one of those people that save your own seed and I 'll be talking about that in another session or you might be buying packs of seed from your local retailer one thing to look at is the use by date on the seeds because often what can happen is we buy seeds they 're very tempting and particularly they 'll buy them online pop them in a box and suddenly we find they 're out of date so seeds have usually a two year lifespan from when they 're packed and the date is always listed somewhere on the pack itself usually down the bottom so you can tell when the seeds basically expire now that doesn 't mean that the seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much lower rate of germination so sometimes things like tomatoes or many of the annual plants that we grow the flowers that we grow we 're still germinate long after the expiry date is up but some things are very sensitive and things like onions parsnips sweet corn you 'll find that if the seeds go just out of date the germination rate will drop by up to 50% and the longer you lever the less germination you 'll get so check they used by date and make sure when you buy seeds that you plan to use them within that season or at least within the next two years and always store them in a container in a cool place out of sunlight so I still mine in sealed containers and usually I store them in the bottom of the fridge in terms of sowing the seeds we really have to pay attention to the detail of sowing seeds to begin with some things are really easy but if you want to get on to things that were more difficult it 's really best to know the basics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to scrub them you can use recycled containers you just have to either wash them in warm soapy water or I put mine just in some disinfectant and household disinfectant and soak them for about 20 minutes you know just take them out let them dry if you 're sowing seed direct into the garden bed that 's fine too it 's really just a matter of what you 're going to do with the seeds and also what the seeds preference is really so some seeds like to be sown direct because they don 't like to be transplanted and that includes crops like carrots and peas and beans well you can sow them direct too because it 's pretty easy the seeds are large and the same and things like a sweet corn but even in that case if you 've got a problem perhaps with mice or rats or other things attacking you garden if you put your seeds in containers and then transfer them into the garden you 've got much better control about the conditions that you put those seeds under the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season that the plant grows in and the temperatures that it likes determine the temperature that that seed likes to actually germinate so for example if you 're growing capsicum or even eggplants they tend to like slightly warmer temperatures for the seed to germinate and so if you try to sow them in the middle of winter where it 's really cold they just don 't come up or they 'll come up very very slowly some seeds really like those cool conditions and they 're the things that typically grow through the winter time like cabbages and kale and broccoli those types of things like cooler temperatures so if you try to sow them and get a crop in too early while the temperatures are still warm chances are again that those seeds won 't come up so pay attention to the information on the back of the pack or read up follow my sowing guide on the website particularly for vegetables to see when is at this time to put your seeds in now when I prepare my seeds for sowing I do a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corky or slow to germinate I 'll often soak them in a mix of seaweed so here I have seaweed mixed at 20 mils per liter and I simply do this at night before I go to bed I put the seeds into a container any sort of container will do put a label in with the name and the variety and then I just simply pour some liquid seaweed into the container and leave them overnight so make sure you do this when you 're going to sow the seeds the next day so leave them soak for about 12 hours but you don 't want to leave them for too much more than that because otherwise your seeds can rot but it 's a terrific technique to get beetroot going spinach it 's also good for flowers like calendula zz tomatoes eggplants those things that take a while for the seeds to absorb moisture and that 's really the key with getting seeds to germinate successfully because getting moisture into the seed is the thing that initiates germination and encourages you seed to grow when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix is the one that we use generally in commercial horticulture and it looks something like this so you might have seen a mix that has sort of white pieces in it and some people think that oh it 's got polystyrene or something in it it hasn 't this is actually a mix of this coiour so this is coconut fiber you soak this block in a bucket of water and it becomes a really fine mixture very good at holding moisture but it 's also very clean mix and that 's quite important for your seed sowing the white material is this here and this is perlite so perlite is another rock it 's a natural material very very light but it also holds some moisture too so generally what I use is this combination and in commercial horticulture often that 's the sort of thing that we we use when it comes to covering the seed we use another product and that 's this one here and this is called vermiculite so vermiculite again it 's another natural product very light hold lots of moisture and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quickly you can use all sorts of materials for seed sowing if you 're using potting mix the only thing I would say is make sure you save the potting mix so the only getting fine material not all those big bark chunks those chunks tend to inhibit the growth of the seed when the taproot is coming out from the seed and also the big chunks mean that the potting mix dries out too quickly for your seeds to germinate successfully you can use saved compost some people use just washed river sand so just use whatever you 've got available and what you find successful for you now if I was sowing these seeds direct into a garden bed I would put a nice fine tooth to the soil that is take some of the soil once it cultivated the soil up and prepared it and then shake some of that saved soil over the top to prepare my seed bed and all I 'd have to do then is pour this mix along complete with the liquid seaweed in a line and pop the label in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the seed to dry out then I can cover it with either more of the sieved mix I could cover it with coil or if you 've got the mickey light you can put that on to the garden as well or you could use sieve compost or again you could use sand if I was sowing these into containers then all I need to do is to drain that out a little and then I can put some of that seed into the container that I 'm using and sometimes I 'll just use there 's the label itself just use that to sprinkle it over the the seed and move it out over the pot soak in the I filled this one with potting mix so the seed is quite large and chunky so I 'm just spreading that out you can have a couple of pots there populated label in and then I would just sprinkle a little bit of this over the top that vermiculite and then when I water that the vermiculite will expand and cover the scene just nicely and I can then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds will be up in three or four days and you end up with something that looks a bit like this these are actually Tomatoes that I did about five days ago but there are instances where certain seeds don 't like to be covered and that particularly applies to really small seeds something lettuce seed and begonia see for example it 's really really tiny so it actually doesn 't want to be covered with anything at all and it 's often a mistake that you know gardeners make at home when you 're trying to get these seeds to germinate because all you ever see on the television is people making great big drill in the soil and burying the seeds really deeply so remember that small seeds only have a limited amount of energy and so if you want to get them to germinate we just take a small amount of the seed so here I 've got an Asian lettuce and Asian lettuce seed will be either white or black depending on the variety this Asian lettuces is black we just sprinkle a few seeds over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can thin that later on but I like to plant my lettuces in bunches pop a label in here and I 've got a whole tray there ready and I 'm just going to share those with people and I can pop them in my own garden just burying the whole pot itself because these are by degradable paper pots so they 'll just decompose in the soil so when it comes to seed sowing it 's really easy but it 's also addictive and you 'll end up probably with more seeds than you ever know what to do with and certainly like me more germinated seedlings when you get to this stage I 'll be showing you in our next session how you take it from here but get into seeds you 'll have lots to share with family and friends and it 's,"(-27.4704528,

AUS,QLD,Brisbane City Council,Brisbane City Council,https://www.youtube.com/c/BrisbaneCityCouncil1,Saving dry seeds with Annette McFarlane,ltPQFsLpoNI,20200510,781.85,"Brisbane City QLD 4000, Australia",2262,hello I 'm in it mcFarland welcome to my first session in seed-saving today I 'm talking dry seed saving so in other words seeds that are dry naturally on the plant and there be easiest to save and there 's a whole variety of them that you can choose from one of the things you may be familiar with perhaps not with this one but things like peas and beans so anything that is a pea or a bean shape in this case this is the native cassia the seed inside is dry and so it 's really easy to save but it also extends to other native plants that we might have so things like this is a Melaleuca and it has seeds on it that dry really readily right through to things like the lettuces calendula zand marigold different seeds that I have here right through to things like this amazing looking seed pod that 's occurred on the strelitzia so there bit of paradise plant so if you think you 'll need to start when you embark on dry seed saving firstly you need something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the easiest you can use old envelopes fit quite good for larger amounts of seeds anything at all that 's paper and that 's basically just to collect your seeds initially and to dry them to the next stage I 'm never without I have to admit a paper bag and a pin in the glove box of the car because when you 're out and about you 'll often see something in fact you 'll find pocket bags and pens in my hand bags because you can often grab seeds while you 're out and about in terms of drawing the seeds then paper is good but I also find these are good so sometimes people buy these sorts of cloth bags and therefore either putting laundry in or for buying fruit and storing your fruit in the refrigerator rather than using plastic bags so find those really terrific for big bunches of sea and I can actually put the seed inside and then just hang that kabaah so we 've got an undercover veranda out of the Sun but where it gets good warmth and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those and even small seeds don 't come through because the mesh is so fine so you find those in supermarkets and to the law stores and that type of thing the other thing you 'll need for your seed cleaning is a variety of different sins so you can use ones that you use in the kitchen but again I usually go in secondhand stores or to dollar stores and you 'll find that you get all different sizes and different grades of mesh there are commercial seed saving service that you can buy but they 're several hundred dollars to buy a set of them and I think these work just as well for most people so the hardest thing I think for anyone to learn initially is when is the seed ready and most people in the harvest their seed far too early or far too late so take for example something like this little white salvia here it 's a great little one that pops up all over the garden and I 've given lots of seed away to people the stage that we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead and looks like this so you leave it right until this stage I would pick these pop them into a paper bag and then write the name and the date on the outside often all right where I 've collected it from as well and then put that into a paper bag and let it dry and eventually maybe three or four weeks later or even longer it 'll get to the stage where I can just put it through a sieve all the seed will come out naturally you can be quite tough and crush it in the bag and you can get the seed out of that now that spike seed there and spike flower is probably something that you might recognize as looking like perhaps any other sort of Sylvia or a basil plant any of your Lemmy AC plants so things like rosemary lavender thyme all have this sort of flower spike so the same applies to them when you 're saving the seed when it comes to letters let us see this ready about three days after flowering so you get a little flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to seed and and then you get these fluffy tops looks a bit like a weed because it 's the member of the Asteraceae family and a lot of our or a daisy family a lot of our Daisy plants are actually members of this same family so the characteristics are the same and this one I 've dried maybe for about a week or ten days I suppose and you can choose if you want to to just put a string around and hang that up you 'd put it in the garage or something like that or in the laundry you just have to be careful that one day don 't come out in the seeds all over the floor which is where these little bags come in because you can actually bag it around it and collect the seed so if I just pick off one of these seed heads and I 've done a few earlier for you you can see that the seed is quite on this case quite large and black and that 's it 's they 're ready to be then just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage when it comes to our native plants sometimes there they can fool you a little bit so here 's an example of a Melaleuca and you can see here 's the current seasons flowering down here we 've already got some seed pods that are formed and often people think that 's the stage to collect them and that at but unfortunately you have to wait longer than that now I only pick these ones here huh just the other day but I was careful to pick well down the stem so you can see this is a spent flower and here is where it flowered last year and that 's seed you can see is coming out all over the place but it 's very very fine so it just looks like dust and it 'll just drop out into a paper bag or a plastic bag even when it 's at this stage so the trick is to make sure that you look down the stem is a larger one here and you can see this one here on the end that seed won 't be ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lower down here this is all starting to ship now so you have to wait until it dries out now sometimes seeds are reluctant to come out of their container and if you look at something like this with a bank seed cone the seeds are actually hidden in under all the remnants of the flowers there and then it gets to this sort of stage and you can see these little protrusions here or where the seed is hiding and if you leave the cone for a very long time and it dries out you 'll gradually find that these little mouths start to open you know just like the big bag bad Bank cement in the story but if you 're impatient you can actually trick the seed by heating it so I just took a little bit of a blowtorch to this one huh but you can also wrap it in foil and put it in a warm oven you could put it in foil and put it on the barbecue and toast it or you can expose it directly to a flame and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to puzzle you don 't do this at home but in actual fact I 'm encouraging you to do this because it 's really great fun to watch the seed capsule sort of open before your eyes and if you do it safely with children it 's fascinating for them to watch and then they can get the seed out but the seeds start to come out black in your hand by the way but can you see that the seeds are amazing they 're like these little flat disks so that 's another trick with seed saving is you need to actually know what the seed looks like in order to know what you 're going to say but if in doubt I always just collect the whole lot and so everything another example is here where were collecting you collect pods so I had collected these and just lift them to dry for a while and then when they were quite dry I 'll pop them into this plastic bag and the reason I 've done that is the seed is really really fine and you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of absorbing packets that come in or different types of foods and that will absorb any extra moisture and you can also get them in this sort of capsule stage so you can reuse those if you like but down the bottom here take a pinch out for you this is what the seeds look looks like so it 's absolutely tiny it 's really really fine and again it takes a long time to come out so you take mature gum nuts and then it may take six months for the seed to actually be shared so seed saving does take a bit of patience other seeds here so ones that are really easy to say things like marigold got some other letters there we 've got here we 've got some parsley any of that group is really easy to save and fennel and other days is that calendula but also this is a little pleated orchid and the capsule here is really amazing it 's quite an interesting sort of shape and it splits open and inside the seed is absolutely like dust so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside there and of course on this one here if I break this open the seats on this strelitzia or bird-of-paradise plant are quite dry and all I need to do is break that open and take them out and this seams are quite hard they 've got a little bit of orange it 's not really flesh it 's just like a beard on it but again the seeds very very hard seeds and I probably would put those in a hot water boiling hot water before I sewed them to actually make those seeds germinate now extracting the seed sipping it and getting rid of all the rubbish it 's not the end of the story if you 're going to sow your seeds straight away you know you don 't have to be too fussy about getting the excess out but if you 're going to store it it 's really important to make sure your seed is clean and before we store the seed we freeze it now this might seem a bit strange but there are lots and lots of insects that are on seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the seeds itself into the seed coat so I just take my seeds that I 've cleaned so here capsicum and they 're pretty easy I don 't bother washing them I 'll just scrape them out of the capsicum and dry them in here oh this is parsley seed a little label inside there so I take these and dry them really well so once you 've cleaned them I 'll leave them to dry for a week or two depending on the seat pop them in this philosophy are and pop them in the freezer and they need to freeze for 24 to 48 hours and the idea with that is that it actually kills any of the insects or the insects themselves without actually harming the seed after that you can take them out and just store them in a sealed container where it 's dark and cool or if you want to you can leave them in the freezer you can make up your own seed pack so you can use envelopes and just run them through your printer but I 'd quite like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ template and make up my own seed packs it 's great because you can share seeds with friends you can post them and you can join a seed exchange group in your local community so you 'll have access to many many more seeds seed saving is easy particularly when we 're saving dry seeds so why not give it a go,"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"

and I 'm one of the environment education officers who works here in the beautiful Raven Street deserve in North Brisbane so the word of the day for you guys is habitat so what is the habitat habitat is any place that an animal lives and there 's some special things you need to know about habitat habitat can be really big like it 's reserved this is one whole habitat or they can be really small like a leaf or rock we call those small habitats micro habitats now generally the bigger the animal the bigger the habitat so you won 't find any elephants hiding underneath rocks from here I know that because there 's no elephants in Australia hi guys I 'm gonna take you on the creek track now and I 'm going to show you an example of a healthy habitat and unhealthy habitat so stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be healthy and unhealthy this is an example of a healthy habitat this is a Creek other car this is actually down for free now I know it 's a healthy habitat because I can see and hear lots of animals I can see the trees around and lots of grass and healthy-looking bushes of that are around the water is nice and clear and there 's no pollution so this is an example of a healthy habitat we 're going to take you now to show you an example of the same Creek but in an unhealthy state believe it or not this is a downpour Creek it 's the top end of the downpour Creek catchment doubtful Creek as you see it here runs all the way through braveman Street reserved and ends up at Boone to wet Lotus down at Moreton Bay humans have modified this part of the creek into a drain so therefore damaging this the habitat the Creek habitat in this area alone you can see by looking at that there 's not much life in their habitat can be natural or man-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out bottom drain we have two types of possums in the reserve we have ringtails and brush tails but this one is made by the ringtail let 's have a look at a man-made habitat now even if they have a ton is man-made and animals will still take advantage of it and live there especially if it provides with shelter there 's something living in this box right here shall we have a look an animal will only live in a habitat if that habitat provides the five things it needs to survive those five things are clean air water shelter good and might I found a really good habitat for you this is a term like this have a look at your high in the tree I thought they did the termite things termite nests are found on the ground and also high up in the trees to make sure really play a really important role in the dirt here they eat the bark that has fallen down on the ground from there recycle the nutrients which goes into the soil and then helps the trees to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only deter might change with habitat but so do thrush sourpusses kookaburras kingfishers enlace monitors so the termites do all the hard work and then everybody has some habitats or under the ground this is a habitat for attracting spider I only have a look you can hardly see it it 's very welcoming for gently prying eyes who spiders are nocturnal so they 'll come out at night normally the females are the big ones that live in the traps and they 'll hang their legs over the edge of the trap wait for an insect to come past they 'll grab it drag it down to the bottom of the trap and then it 's shot slices I 've got me here we have a nicest thing that 's feeding next but Sonia has about 2,000 species of native bees only about 11 live in colonies right here this one 's called a stripper bad be the paradiddle it looks like a bit of floss through the bag feed Sabine 's a little bit of honey but not as much honey as the European being this is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really important part of the environment they 're very good pollinators so very good for pollinating flowers and this week [Music] [Music] this side is called a monkey rape wine and it 's called a monkey right vine because it likes to climb up trees just like a monkey does tree is a really important habitat for lots of different animals this is a really old tree and as you can see there 's a couple of hollows in this tree in his hollow you 'll sometimes find lace monitors typify things you might find our snakes lizards lots of different animals how much take about 100 years to fall so it 's really important that one protect our old tree there 's one animal at Raven Street reserve things are sort of smell before you see it and that is our flying foxes have Raven Street we 're lucky enough to have a camp for flying foxes the fact that they are here is a good indication that this habitat provides for five things that they need to survive flying foxes are really important part of the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Australia",1275,hi everyone my name is Jackie and I 'm Mike we work for the Brisbane City Council environment centres and today we 're here at one of our council deserves lands this is a very special environment it 's a really important habitat habitat is something that we 're going to talk about today what exactly is a habitat so habitat is the natural home for a plant or an animal and animals get all of the things that they need for survival from their habitat it 's five things five things lemme guess they need clean air clean water food source shelter and also a mate we 're gonna go for a little walk through the queen of wetlands today and we 're going to be looking out these five things keep your eyes peeled and let 's go oh wow gross it 's Jackie look at this looks like someone 's spat in the tree oh my no that 's not spit this is actually something called a spittle bug huh so the foam that we can see on the kazarina tree here is produced by the nymphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spittlebug and they produce this foam from the SAP in the tree and it helps to protect the young from drying out and from predators until they 're grown up [Music] Wow look at this it 's a big scratches you might see going all the way up this tree no I reckon they 're from a lace monitor or a goanna so up here you probably be going up either son himself or even possibly looking right kind of food that a goanna would find out from this tree maybe could be birds eggs maybe even small mammals at the top there as well I can see a beautiful oak so these big old trees and this is a Queensland is they 're really important habitat trees for animals like monkeys or also for opossums gliders and all kinds of birds that we use the tree hollows has to show time history is probably a couple of hundred years old and it takes at least a hundred years for a tree to develop these beautiful hollows which is so important for shelter in this kind of habitat so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiter birds it 's a royal spoonbills beautiful crest on the back of UK and obviously that typical spoonbill get used to the muddy water so just of course our track is another track and this is made by termites this is the termite mud Shoob I like to call it a termite highway and the reason I like to call it that is because the termites actually traveled through what they 're essentially tunnels now inside here they create the perfect temperature and humidity that the termites need also it protects them from predators and also from that that bright someone this one 's really cool because it heads all the way up into this dead tree which also provides habitat for tree crevice skink which you can sometimes see hiding underneath the bark super cool this e is a Melaleuca trees it might also not as a paper Factory and as the name suggests it 's got this white paper e bark this tree has an extended flowering period which lends your pollen and things like our honey it is bees and bats as well it provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of insects Mike likes to hide underneath the bark this tree would have had a lot of traditional everything uses very important for this area and region there is an incredible amount of diversity with assure those that live here at the Brunner wetlands and also down at the mud flats at Nigel Beach all of the species that live around here have unique adaptations or features that enable them to survive in this particular environment as you can see here each of the different species of shorebirds has unique beak adaptations that are never learned to feed on different food some are feeding on shrimp right down deep in the sand and the month whereas others are feeding on crabs at different depths we like themselves so the unique big adaptations means that each species is feeding on a different type of food and you 're not competing with each other for the same food we 're really fortunate we 've had so much rain in the last few weeks and it 's an absolute frog frenzy here at funda wetlands at the moment you can see green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frogs sometimes they can be really tricky to spot you might need to listen with your ears to hear them or you might look in little hidey holes this here is a green tree frog it 's Australia 's most recognizable frog because of its large size they can grow up to 11 centimeters and usually because of their green color now you can find this frog in a variety of different types of habitats including here at the wetlands in swamp lands but also sometimes in our very own backyard during the day they like to hide because they are nocturnal so you 'll often find them in little hidey holes underneath rocks sometimes in hollows as well then at night time they 'll come out searching for food so they love to eat that youth like crickets cockroaches sometimes bats more so much as well [Music] this rug is called a strapped of nitro it 's one of the more contracts that you can find here across Brisbane unfortunately it does get confused a lot of the time with the cane toad it looks a little bit different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground whereas okay Joe has upright body and has those big plans on the back of their head this rug also has more predominant eyes as well so if there 's a few key differences to tell apart straight back from the cane toad so this is a great example of an arboreal termite nest which is obviously habitat for termites themselves but also for other species as well this particular one has a big hole that 's been drilled into it and most likely a kookaburra has actually nested inside the Fenway there possums will also use the termite nest as well sometimes go in as get up in there as well but thanks for joining us today on our adventure through the Google wetlands where we 've learned so much about habitats and the unique plants and animals that call this area sit do you remember the five important things that make up a habitat how about you Jackie you remember five things food water shelter clean air and a mate very good so hopefully you guys picked up on all those today something else we want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really matter to you know help preserve the habitat that we have a remnant in Brisbane City so thinking about things like when you 're not chasing anymore maybe you pick up rubbish should you see any and make sure you put your garbage into the bin where it belongs thanks for coming guys and we hopefully see you guys in the future coming visit us at the funda wetlands environment Center bye catcher [Music],"(-27.4704528,

Library,O7BiwI70OKY,20200522,1084.309,"Brisbane City QLD 4000, Australia",2792,[Music] hello everyone I 'm Matthew from Karen Dale library before we get started I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we meet than pay my respects to elder 's who are with us today and those who have passed welcome to library information Week 2020 this year the theme is create every day this week Brisbane libraries will be sharing an online event celebrating creativity we encourage you all to get creative with us and share the projects we inspire today we 'll be making a simple book together to encourage creating connections with family friends and community today 's crafts you 're gonna need a couple of materials you need two pieces of cardboard same size at least as large as whatever you intend to find today I 'm gonna be using a five colored paper but you can use anything you have around the house whether that be some old postcards maybe some photos maybe you 've drawn a couple of pictures you 'd like to put into a book whatever it is as long as you can fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're also gonna need some string for our binding whether that 's kitchen twine some old ribbon you have lying around and if you would like to create a class for your book you will also need a button for today we 're also gonna need some glue a ruler a pencil a pair of scissors some tape and a hole punch whether that 's a single a double whatever you have is fine so to get started we 're gonna start by making our face plates what you 're gonna need to do is take one of those cut pieces of cardboard and measure out about 2.5 centimeters off the front draw a line across that and then we 're gonna cut that out what this is going to be as for when we make our holes for our binding our cover needs to be able to move the bit once you 've created a straight line across there what you 're gonna do is grab your tape and get a piece of tape Lodge has this material using place it across the end and then line it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of gap that you 're using between the two so you see now I 've got this small line in between and that 's going to basically create out joint where do they want tape on one side on the side that 's going to be out front so that doesn 't move that way when we find our book later on with that done we can get back to covering it today I 'm using some old wrapping paper that I had lying around if you 've got our egami paper colored paper a drawing that you liked as long as it 's about a centimeter or so larger than whatever you 're using for your front plate grab your glue and using the front of our book which you can label if you would like to remember I 'm gonna put glue on that so it 's the side with the tape this is going to go facedown in the middle of your colored paper now you can measure out exactly how big it needs to be but we 're going to cover the other side as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from there you want to cut off each of the corners the gap that you leave between that line there and the edge of your corner is roughly equal to the width of your cardboard so we 're going to go ahead and do that on each of our corners I might just take a little bit more off there it doesn 't matter if you get it exact but if you 'd like you can measure it out with that done grab your glue again and just run that along each of those tabs and then being careful to keep your paper nice and tight fold them in and tuck them down you notice in the corners they should come together nicely but just make sure that you don 't leave any kind of jagged edges there you want to be careful when you 're doing this step your honor having things like this fold up if you do just run a bit of extra glue over there depending what you 're using to find it might be a little bit more resistant so you can always add a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glue stick but if you 've only got PVA or something like that that will be fine just be mindful that you don 't put too much under there so that the paper walls so I 've now got my front cover all down up on the backside I 'm gonna go ahead and do the same with my other piece of card in this one I haven 't drawn a line across here and cut anything out this is just as the same size you 'll notice without line now of course there is a little bit of difference here 's one I prepared earlier so now without two pieces found ready so this is going to be the front of the book at this stage we are going to want to put in a hole and that 's gonna want to be in the middle of your book so measure out whatever you 've got grab your hole punch and place a single hole through the whole width of the card go ahead and do the same on the front now notice I have the side with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this side measure it out again right in the middle now this is only if you intend to put a buck on the front if you 're not intending to put a button you don 't need to put these holes in on the back end we 're gonna create a bit of ribbon they 're basically the tire ow button once it 's on thread it through from the back and you can leave as much as you like I 'm gonna leave about that cut off your ribbon and you want to create enough that you can bind it to the back so in this case we 've left a large strip there and you want to grab a bit more tape and just tape that down nice and flat you can use glue if you 've got your glue there that 's fine too if you want to put a staple in it do bear in mind you are going to pierce the front of your hawk in this case the back of our book once you 've got that in ready to tie up do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickness of holes you 've got in your button that 's the kind of ribbon you want to put through there because it 's just being used to tie that in you can go ahead and thread that through and tie off your button first if you 'd like it doesn 't matter which order you go in for this I 'm just gonna run it straight through the middle cut a length of kitchen twine and thread that through you want to have that reasonably tight to the front but you do also want to leave enough space in between there that you 'll be able to feed your ribbon through HN on the top trim off any excess you might have I might need a second piece just to keep it nice and strong because you are gonna have some pull against that and you put in front so now you should have two pieces each with their own piece of ribbon through it one for the button that that 's just going to tie on later when we 're finished all right with those done we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some other piece of colored paper I 've just chosen some plain blue but whatever you 've got around is fine this is pretty simple if you haven 't already you want to make it roughly a centimeter shorter just so that fills in that gap but leaves a little bit on the side so that you are not creating that joint where it 's gonna just peel run your glue again over the edge and stick it down you can be as exactly as you 'd like if you want to grab a ruler and measure it out that 's fine wrap ups today it just needs to create a binding force if you are finding old photos or any kind of postcard bear in mind that hinge and the binding that we 're putting in on the site is going to cover a little bit of the words so for that case you might want to create a hinge on each piece of card that you 're going to be binding you can still this is my side for my hinge and I 'm just gonna put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that later on when I do Bend it open it doesn 't pull at that tab you can always add a little extra glue just to make sure that that 's strong if you want you can run a piece of tape across there that 's going to be hidden by our binding later on so it won 't matter if you add a bit more reinforcement there you can put those two aside to dry I 'm going to move on to what we 're gonna bind today I 'm using the a for blue paper I 've chosen a piece of paper the same color as my inside just to give it a bit more coherency as it goes through you need to mark out the holes now for your binding doesn 't matter what you 'd like to do you can use one hole you can use two holes you can use three holes whatever you 'd like is fine for today I think I 'm going to go with three so you want to measure amount roughly equal I 'm going to go two centimeters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle so let 's split the difference in five and a half and that 's going to be a position for my three holes make sure you 're lining up the point in whatever hole punch you are using and just clip them you 'll see coming in a little bit we 've left a bit of gap there do you make sure that you are measuring this step because you will need to put the same holes in your cup up later on so now you should end up with a stack of paper whole card whatever you have your three or however many holes you 've done now gonna take our free space hopefully they 've dry it and you 're gonna line them up hopefully you remember where you position those holes earlier and mark those out we 're just going to create another three holes be careful with your card here at this stage if you have added a lot of finding it might become a little bit you could break go ahead put in your three measured go ahead and do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the front of mine so the holes are going in the hinge the opposite side to my party for the back you obviously want the other side to your ribbon measured out and punch right so now we have how insides now outsides each with three holes all we 're gonna do now for our final step is to put them together today I 'm just going to use some present wrapping ribbon whatever you 'd like if you 've got some craft ribbon or as I said before kitchen twine is fine it doesn 't matter what you 're using you 're going to need about a length equal to twice the height of your book if you like got there now now what you 're going to want to do is fold in half and grab a eyelet and push that through the front from the back of your book through to the front so I 'm going to go through the back plating first and being careful that I don 't let it spread through the whole ribbon and then going to grab my pages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my book if you have used a drawing or a picture or anything for the front of your book do you make sure that you are happy with the orientation of that drawing as you 're going through so from there we 're just going to pull that eyelid over to the back of the book across the top or the spine there and pull the rest of the ribbon through and that 's going to create out first we 're gonna go down out to the end and do something similar so run your piece through to the middle there just one at this point push it through the back thread it through your pages and you can just kind of like a flipbook kind of roll them through to you 've got what you need at the time thread through the pages just be careful you don 't miss one like I have here and then thread it through hmm your friend all that time you should see you 've got one piece of ribbon through and you don 't want at the back there I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top at this point you can fold it over into an eye and just thread that through you know space through the back grab all your pages three pages and then through your front pull the ribbon through you actually want to pass underneath this ribbon here and go back through again with that now you should see they all line up should be a simple matter just to push it back through again you 'll end up with that island hold your finger in and pull it through so now you should have two of your bindings one here top and bottom it 's the final one just going to take that end that we 've just thread it through the top of our thread it through the middle whichever we should all be together for you and you know take you to spare ends pull everything nice and tight be nice and happy take them up and tie them off to this original string do whatever kind of knot you 'd like good difference I 'm just going to go underneath sometime and then through again if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously the volume of that tie is going to impact how it sits on the ground or the table we 're just gonna go nice simple time that you can hide those by pushing them into the back plate there as well I 'm just gonna trim mine up nice and close and there we have our finished book ribbon tie across the button ready to go hope you enjoy sharing that

rhyme session with you because you can 't come to us we like coming to you still so hopefully you 're going to enjoy some songs to share with your baby today before we go any further though we are going to do our children 's acknowledgement to country which goes like this here is the land here is the sky here are my friends and here am i and the other important thing we 're gonna do today because there 's lots of germs around is we 're gonna wash our hands here we 've got a little song to do that which is this is the way we wash our hands wash our hands wash our hands this is the way we wash our hands early in the morning that 's great the food um no I said clean nice and clean wonderful so shall we say hello to everyone we 're gonna do some hi hello we shall hey hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hi hello and how are you how are you today how are you sure I 'm feeling pretty good about you all the benefit seeing you ah hi journey that we are going to do a little peekaboo saw and it 's always lovely to do these songs ID with you baby lying on a rug in front of you or on your lap because babies really like seeing your face as you 're talking to them and expressing to them it 's actually got a name it 's called serve and return and so even though if you were just going and going at the baby and they 're googling back it 's still a serve and return transaction so we 're going to do a little song which is called peekaboo a little game of peekaboo after 3 1 2 3 peek-a-boo peek-a-boo I see you I see you I see your tiny toes I see the your butt to nose peek-a-boo I see you let 's do that one again I like that one ok peek-a-boo peek-a-boo I see you I see you I see your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very good I love that one I also like that you get to touch your baby and give them a bit of a tickle the next song that we are going to do does involve a tickle we 're going to round and round the garden so I like to start off with Bob 's hand so we 're going to get in here we 're gonna go around and round the garden like a teddy bear a one step a two step and tickle you under there ah beautiful I love songs we tickles because you 'll see whenever we do our sessions we do quite a lot of repetition and that 's because it 's really important for learning and with songs who tickles you can see it in action because when you 've repeated us on quiet a bit with your baby you 'll start to notice even with the really little ones they 'll start to recognize what 's about to happen they 'll tense up right before the tickle comes and that 's a really important skill for literacy it 's important skillful life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen this before and I know what is happening so let 's do around around the garden again right around the garden like achieve it one step at ease and they is another versed around around the garden I think this might be a new one for me let 's have a look excellent so we 're gonna go around there Billy and we 're gonna go round and round the haystack with the little mouse or one stick a two-step and into this little house right underneath your baby 's chin there that 's a good run it 's nice to vary it up a bit sometimes don 't you think is there 's lots of variations you can just develop yourselves these are just the basics something to work with and something to build up and be comfortable with yeah okay so do we have another song to do all we do another little tickly one which is these are baby 's fingers and these are baby 's toes and this is baby 's belly button and round and round it goes we do that one more time @ @ @ @ @

this is Annette McFarland here for Brisbane City Council normally you 'd find me in a city council library running one of their face-to-face sustainability programs but since we can 't use libraries at this point in time and we know people still want a garden we thought you 'd give you some hints and tips that perhaps you can use while you 're spending lots of time at home so I sowed some seedlings tomatoes I 've got a bit carried away I must admit and to recap what I 've done so far to get to this stage I took some tomato seed I put it in little containers with 20 mils of sea weed per liter of water and doctor seed in and soaked it for 24 sorry for 12 hours and then I started just pouring it over the top of this mix the next day I 've actually got 10 11 different varieties here so I need to move them on to the next stage this is five days after seed sowing and in that stage where we put them into a larger container @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomatoes in containers right through from seed sowing stage right tool fruit picking stage because tomato is very prone to lots of pests and diseases and I find them much easier to manage particularly things like we 're not nematode if I grow my tomatoes in containers so to move these on to the next stage I can plant some of them but I can also share lots with family and friends I 'm going to pick them out I would normally use these smaller disposable biodegradable containers but I found that these Tomatoes have a really long root system so I 'm upsizing to these what we call forestry tubes they 're nice and long and they 'll accommodate the roots that are on these tomatoes so there are two methods of doing this you can either pre fill your first YouTube and in terms of cleaning these they 're recycled but I have washed them in soak them in disinfectant and then just let them dry you could wash them in hot soapy water and then dry them in the sunshine that 's a good way of cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've just filled this with mix and water that you can see it 's still dripping there so it 's really well watered now we can just use something like this is a meat skewer you could use any sort of thing that you 've got it all or stick from the garden and we make a nice deep hole right down into that container because you 'll see when I lift out one of these Tomatoes they have a really long root system it 's important this is the tule for what we call cotyledon stay edge of the tomatoes and it 's important to actually do this technique while the tomatoes are quite small hold them by the seed leaf this is the first leaf that the tomato produces and when you take it out you can see it 's got quite a long root system there so we need to be able to put that into the container without bending it up like this we don 't want it to do a u-turn we want it to grow straight down so we gently using meat skew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container and then firm the soil around it and you can bury it just slightly deeper than it was in its position in the original container because tomatoes will actually take that treatment and it will help your seedlings stay up upright pop it into its container and make sure you immediately put a label in with the variety that you 're growing and that 's really important for me because I 've got lots of different types the other technique that you can use is often what we use when we 're putting up other materials or printing out other materials like native tubes or anything that has a really long root system so what we do in this stage is take out to half fill it with our mix and then just sort of lay it on its side so you 've got it half filled on the bottom half there then we take our seedling out again levering it out gently doesn 't matter if all the soil falls off the roots making sure that you 're holding carefully onto those cotyledons and then we actually just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that it 's it it 's a bit of a tricky technique to get used to but once you 've done it a few times you 'll work it out and then all we have to do is fill up the rest of our container so I usually like to hold the seedling in place and then top up the rest of the container and that way you 'll see fill it right to the top it 's right in the middle fill it right to the top because when we water remember that potting mix is going to shrink and so it 'll be exactly at the right level pop in your label again so that you know exactly what this variety is and of course in most cases you would give these a really good water with liquid seaweed and they can go immediately out into full sunshine these have been out in full sunshine today if it 's a really hot day you know perhaps leave them in the shade until the following day it 's now late in the day for me so I choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late afternoon when it 's cooler and then water them in with liquid see we tomorrow they 'll be standing up looking fabulous they 'll be taking advantage of the nutrients that 's in the potting mix just make sure your potting mix is not too chunky and of course always add some extra nutrition to the potting mix in terms of a good balanced complete fertilizer and your tomatoes will be often growing thanks for joining me,"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"

4000, Australia",2228,"thank you very much Minister Fletcher and I would now like to welcome acting their a counselor ad Adrienne Shrimant Sarina to speak counsellor is normally the deputy mayor acting mayor at the moment and the chairman of public ten active transport committee please welcome council foreigner good morning everyone pleasure to be here with you I want to start by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land I also want to thank my federal colleagues here Minister Fletcher Ross faster Trevor Evans three gentlemen here in the front have been massive champions of the Brisbane Metro project at the local level Ross and Trevor have campaigned hard and lobbied hard to get federal support for this project but they 've had an open ear from Minister Fletcher and the other senior members of the government and we really appreciate the support at that federal level we now in a really short period of time for a major project have a project that has its construction fully funded and that is indeed an exciting thing I want to acknowledge my colleagues councillor Amanda Cooper and understand councillor Fiona King is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state government in particular representatives from industry that have travelled to be here with us today we really appreciate the strong interest in the room the full house that we 've got here and it 's an exciting thing for a council to see the level of interest in this project Brisbane is just about to enter a particularly exciting and transformative time in our city 's development the story of Brisbane has always been a story of growth and change and if you go right back to the beginning that has always been the case but if you look there 's been certain bursts in our city 's history of massive growth and change world war two was a massive period of change for our city where we that we were the headquarters here for the war effort in the general McArthur was here we saw massive investment in our city 's infrastructure we saw the cease population almost double in a short period of time with overseas troops coming here we fast forward then to times like the Expo 88 and anyone who was in Brisbane at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was another turning point in the city 's history right now though these next five years will be a transformation of that kind of scale next year we will see the staged opening of the Howard Smith wharves Riverside precinct under construction now a precinct right in the heart of the city that will help transform an underutilized disused part of the riverfront open it up for business and the community providing new park land a recreational space new restaurants and conference facilities we will then see the year after in 2020 the Brisbane Airport second runway come online and that piece of infrastructure fantastic that it 's privately funded will open up the capacity constraints in the Brisbane Airport and see us through for many years into the future but will facilitate the growth in local tourism the growth in local jobs the growth in economic activity will then see shortly after in about 2022 the opening of the Queen 's wharf Brisbane precinct which in itself is a massive more than three billion dollar investment in the city and once again a transformative project a project that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tourists from other parts of Australia other parts of the world here and growing the economy and if there 's any doubt about the impact of a development like this you just have a look at what happened in Singapore with the Marina Bay Sands development we will see a similar transformation of Brisbane as a result of that project and it 's all about going for growth not growth in terms of the local economy but growth interstate and in nationally in terms of visitation all of this though all of this extra activity all of this growth needs better public transport infrastructure and the next two exciting projects happening Brisbane Metro and crossover rail and both of those projects will be under construction at the same time both of those projects will be delivered and operational within a window of around 2023 to 2024 so essentially in the next approximately five years all of that major infrastructure and change is coming online I 'm excited about it the city will be a better place for it but that critical transport infrastructure is going to be essential now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and providing that new infrastructure as I mentioned before just in a short period of just over two years we 've gone from a concept a project that was a concept to now a project that has its construction fully funded and that is an exciting thing in itself and in the in the scheme of major projects they can often take a lot longer than that to build up momentum we have the momentum now we 're going full steam ahead with construction fully funded and the support of the federal government this procurement process that we 're kicking off today with your help will ensure that that momentum continues so that we can get on with delivering this project in the period of the past two or just over two years we 've seen the preparation of a detailed business case which included as a key part of it a really detailed options analysis and you 'll be well aware that the original Metro concept has changed significantly to what we have today and I think that 's a good thing that is something that shows that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best solution to the problems and challenges that Brisbane has in our transport system at the moment we also want the outcome to be the one that delivers the things that our city really need for the future so we knew that we needed to deal with the key bottlenecks in the transport network the cultural center precinct the Victoria Bridge Adelaide Street our busway network in Brisbane is a fantastic asset for the city it carries right now today it carries more people than many heavy rail lines in Australia carry and the key constraints in that network limit its capacity for future growth the bus way even though it is a fantastic asset wasn 't finished properly we 're going to do that with connecting up the missing sections in the inner city we 're going to change the way that the network operates with the new Metro vehicles a more efficient operating model new technology to help us make sure that we can deliver high-frequency reliable services in terms of where you can help as an industry this project needs your innovation and needs your input we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've done a lot of engineering work and preparation to put that out but I have no doubt that the final product of Metro will change again and it will change because of your input it will change because of the innovation that you can bring we 've seen it on so many council projects before where our original design was improved when we went out and work with industry to get that innovation to get the experience of actually delivering these projects and we expect to see that with Brisbane Metro as well in terms of what we 're after from this project this this is not an engineering project it 's not even a public transport project it is a project that facilitates the growth of the city and the efficient movement of people around that city and it has to be more than an engineering project the cultural center station and the new underground metro station that we want to build through this project is the busy public transport station in Queensland and so we believe it 's more important in Central Station more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network and so we need a station that is fitting of that importance of station this is Queensland 's number one station that you 're being asked to work with us to build and so it has to be more than a functional station it has to create a sense of arrival it has to create a sense of place when you arrive at the cultural center metro station we want people to be impressed by that station as a destination in itself we need that station to have a bucketload of public art and impressive features that that you can bring to us with your city or your experience on many projects we want this to be a true statement for the city and given that we are in the cultural center precinct a cultural arrival experience is something that we 're looking for and so I can 't stress that enough a bland station that does the the job from a technical point of view is not going to be enough the other thing that we need here is improve public realm now this particular precinct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view but it 's busy from a pedestrian and cyclist point of view as well and it 's it 's the gateway to a number of key hubs in the city not only of people getting off on that the cultural center to to visit the cultural center the museum and the other facilities nearby South Bank there 's also around 20,000 people a day who walk across Victoria Bridge to get to the city and that in itself is something critically important so creating a much more pedestrian and cyclist friendly environment is going to be critical creating public space that benefits the city is going to be critical as well so when it comes to the vehicles we are looking for something that Australia has not seen before we want the cutting-edge technology from around the world when it comes to vehicles to be put forward to us for Brisbane Metro now we 've seen some of the vehicles that are on offer around the world and we 're excited about those we 've also seen the fast moving of technology in this space as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China at the moment of a vehicle that looks similar to the ones we 've got here that is fully autonomous fully electric this is type of thing we 're going to see in the future now we are going into this with an agnostic view on what the powertrain of the vehicle will be but we are absolutely willing to consider all options so whether it 's a straight diesel euro-6 diesel or whether it 's a hybrid or whether it 's a fully electric vehicle we are wanting to consider all of those options we are excited about the future of these vehicles and what what technology is on offer but we 're also excited about the passenger experience that they can offer we don 't want people to get on these vehicles and have a standard bus way experience we want them to feel like they 're getting on to you know a modern tram kind of vehicle and that that is the experience we are going for with these vehicles so looking forward to seeing what the market has to offer looking forward to working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over shortly to our project director Steve hammer who 's going to take you

on their infrastructure I 'm pleased to say that the premier Anastacia polishe supports this project the deputy premier supports this project the Minister for transport supports this project the project is listed in the state infrastructure plan it is listed in the south-east queensland regional plan we have the state on board for this project and now it 's a matter of going forward with them working through any issues and challenges that will come up during that process but I am absolutely confident that we 've got a project that has the support of all three levels of government and has a

Australia",2345,look first of all Utley to congratulate counsel and bringing this project to market and building on what 's been over a decade of consistency and delivery as a client there 's no sovereign risk or worry the contractors have about counsel when it comes to self 30 and project so well done in that and I gained I 'd like to congratulate Council on consulting with industry continuing to and adopting a collaborative partnership model for the main project and I 've got so two questions that relate to the collaborative partnership project the first is the mention of the tender reimbursement fees Council may not have decided on on that yet but having looked at the design for this job it strikes me that the complexity involved and from an engineering perspective our law and would attract something of a tender cost of around at least 1% of the contract value so it 's significant funds that the contracting parties will be asked to invest and participate in this and a time where the industry is very lean and also competing for other projects and other jurisdictions particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere councils and thoughts on that and obviously we 're willing to further a consult and related to that is whether you 're taking forward two contractors into the final competitive phase there 's obviously more than two would be from a desirability point of view difficult for industry and the second questions are simpler one is just around the declaration of cost and non cost at the tender process is where the council can give some declaration of the waiting 's for for their non cost criteria and the cost criteria because it just allows us as proponents when we 're betting these jobs to horn our skills and our energy to what is really important and what constitutes value for counsel hopefully there was a fairly clear questions thank you thank you very much for your questions Peter in response to the first question with regards to tender reimbursement councils indicating in the expression of interest documents to what level that reimburse we 'll be there we 'll be reimbursement for the shortlisted parties who are participating in the ECI phase so for the and then for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of that reimbursement councils considering reimbursement up to the level of three million dollars for the bid reimbursement so that that will all be detailed in the tender documents in terms of the second part to your first question which was a number of tenderers councils yet to decide on what level of shortlisting will progress into the ECI phase whether that 's two or three we 're yet to make that decision and in part that will be dependent a little on the level of responses from the EOI and to the strength of those submissions that we receive in terms of your second question which ladies waiting so council through its process will likely communicate to what it to what levels evaluation criteria waiting 's will be so it 's certainly for the expression of interest process we 've got an indication as to what those weightings are and then as we progressed through the process we 'll be looking to see how we communicate those weightings because i appreciate it in the type of contract that we 've got there are many aspects of this project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including price and non price criteria as the acting mayor pointed out aspects such as the urban realm urban design aspects on some of the larger infrastructure components in particular around the new cultural center station are very important and therefore how the teams best present themselves and how we work through that in the ECI phase is clearly an aspect that will come up in a lot of the interactive tender process okay thank you next question we have one in the middle hi gentlemen I 'm just wondering if we are going for the major sorry my name is Julie for us from John Holland if you 're going for the major cultural package does that preclude you from going for the other station packages given that the collaborative partnership will be sorting the tender for those thanks Julie for your question it will not preclude you the the shortlisted parties from submitting an expression of interest process whilst being in a process for the collaborative partnership because the shortlisting process the actual as you saw on the program the tender phase for those construct only packages will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unsuccessful party in that process should they have submitted an EEO I it will be important for them to go through that process and demonstrate their abilities to deliver the construct only packages well therefore should they be shortlisted which would be highly likely given the short listing for a DNC package would therefore have the ability to participate in those construct only packages any more questions this is a good first opportunity to get quick answers before you launch yourself yes one more thank you very much Oliver Lauper latest projects thank you for the presentation my question would be will council select separately the designer in the contractor to form the collaborative partnership or the expectation that consortium consisting of designer and contract constructor will put in a submission for the UI thank you again for the question our our expression of interest documents will be seeking teams of designers and contractors submitting proposals expressions of interest for the short listing process one more at the frontier Thank You Toni per cubic from Seymour white asked me if you could just give a little bit more clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see we 've got an expression of interest which will be out today closes and obviously there 's an ECI process later on you 've got a process in their middle called an RFP just explain what that RFP process is for us please Thanks thanks Tony say it 's a slight variant on what we would typically see through the process so as set out we 've got an expression of interest process which will look to the teams put forward and their their capabilities to deliver the type of work that we 're we 're seeking to deliver the second stage is a shortlisted suite of respondents to the EO I and we 'll look to further detail their team 's capabilities in delivering the works but probably most importantly in addition to further interaction with counsel with regards to their their teams and their abilities to work in a collaborative partnership and their demonstrated experience is a the competitive element to that is the submission of the fee the margin part which is the overhead and profit margin component so there is a first stage you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then upon assessment of those will further shortlist for the RFP stage or the ECI stage which will be a much more intensive collaborative element and it 's those shortlisted parties where the significant expenditure and effort is required through the tender process of which the bid reimbursement applies to the latter stage of those proponents more questions yes one more Ian lane from WSB given that the majority of the project will be delivered as a collaborative partnership although there are DNC and construct only components as accounts although the project team decided what they are going to do in terms of contract administration or verification yet so we 're it 's still working through those aspects although under the collaborative partnership will follow a similar process to what I believe we an industry have experienced in the Alliance type phase so that we 'll have a highly integrated project team of council officers along with the market participants so the contractor and designer in a co-located fashion and then Council will also likely have an independent verifier participating on behalf of Council to verify the works undertaken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other direct elements for clearly the design and construct component for the depo and also then the fleet component as well which is under the design and build so the the independent verifier function for the collaborative partnership given it 's got a component of construct only DNC and also management of the systems element we 'll have quite an intensive independent verification process to that and then separately will be councils other activities whereby it 's delivering more directly with the market more questions then a good role here yes one more two more okay we 'll start at the back if that 's okay hi I 'm Shaun stove on with ABB I noticed that the delivery of the depo package is concurrent with the vehicle selection process so if there is an impact hypothetically with the propulsion system and the facilities required in the Depot how would that be managed thanks for the question I guess this goes a little way back to in the first phase of the vehicle procurement firstly and our registration of interests and more importantly our expressions of interest so as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the supply market with respect to the vehicle across a number of aspects and I guess the largest variable to that would be the powertrain side of that and therefore that process through then specifying our technical specs for that dnc your design and build package will then allow us to progress with a level of certainty to procure the pilot vehicle and it 's with the execution of that pilot vehicle that will then be starting to overlap with our design and construct and effectively our design for the depots so we 'll look to mitigate that risk and remove that risk because clearly we don 't want to build a Depot that doesn 't suit the vehicle so ensuring that we connect those two packages together to ensure we do risk the supply of the Depot is is acknowledged thank you for that question thank you I think we had another one towards a different thanks Dave Ben fluckey from Oregon just it 's just some clarity around how you 're going to procure the and more and more portly contract the systems and and suburban infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be through the collaborative framework and and and if it is that way then is PCC doing the aoi process and identifying the proponent and then sort of no baiting them into the into the collaborative partnership the so so currently Council is working through the specifications required for the suburban elements which are relatively more straightforward but in more importantly the systems elements so where as you would note in the draft design report and the arrangements there counsels looking to put in place for the project the systems component was relatively small is quite integrated within the infrastructure component so we 're currently developing up those specs and therefore the expression of interest process to gain market gain market response for those shortlisted those assists and shortlisted parties to then be transferred into a procurement process undertaken on behalf of Council by the collaborative partnership so in terms of the technical the commercial aspects of whether they 're no they today and I think we we haven 't yet fully developed the collaborative partnership deed although getting quite close and really I think the the commercial complexities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collaborative partnership or a direct contract with Council were yet to resolve that will be issued as part of the RFP for the ECI phase any more questions yep we have one towards the back yeah Brett from Jones Lang LaSalle and given the concurrent tendering with the Cross River Rail how will council assess capability of the consortium teams at the same time that those same consortium teams might be bidding for the cross several components thanks for the question in the evaluation of our procurement program where highly cognizant of the procurement program for Cross River Rail and therefore I think in evaluating the collaborative partnership clearly given that is a partnership between Council and the contractor and designer personnel and the capability of those organizations to put forward a team that will work in a collaborative nature with Council it will be high on the assessment criteria so therefore notwithstanding that Cross River Rail has a process underway for their two major packages and there is a timing overlap of which market proponents may well be participating in both but will be seeking from those proponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collaborative partnership in either scenario clearly the scenario whereby they 're selected as a successful party for Cross River Rail will have a bearing on their ability to deliver for the brisbane metro but we 'll leave that to the market to to provide to us that assurance that they can deliver those works but but I think I think it 's important to note that council and the Cross River Rail delivery Authority are in close close engagement with regards to the scale of two major projects their project is very large in scale at a you know you know level that we 've seen previously in the toll road space in terms of the two major packages and therefore we are working with them to ensure that those two programs of work are coordinated in a you know you know strong fashion,"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"

councillor Simmonds Thank You citizens of Brisbane great to see you obviously I 'm bringing a London accent to this conversation I hope that for some of you that 's not too off-putting I promise not to be a whinging poem let me start by saying that it 's really a delight to be here not just because I love visiting Brisbane but because it 's very important for me to visit Brisbane because I do spend a lot of time when I 'm travelling the world telling other people about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very important for me to reconnect with what 's happening when I first visited Brisbane eight years ago I saw this set of words Brisbane Australia 's new world city and firstly when I saw that I was sort of presently surprised the idea of a new world city and then I became actually quite curious about what does that mean to be a new world city and then in the end I became rather deeply inspired by this idea and I I left Brisbane thinking I must really find out a bit more about what a new world city is so actually for the last eight years I 've spent quite a bit of my time trying to do that and I 've come up with various formulas to do with the size of the economy its orientation towards global business clusters its ranking as it were top hundred for commercial investment hundred for visitors and tourists it 's competitive nurse it 's it 's global recognition and I 've begun to develop a kind of definition of what is a new world city and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some of the new technologies that we have around in this sort of 21st century that we 're living in and I 've also learned that new world cities are important places for people who are enjoying more life expectancy than they might have hoped when they were first born and also for young people particularly people going to university or leaving university and thinking about their place in the labor market for the first time and as a consequence of this working with my friends at Jones Lang LaSalle we 've started to draw these sort of global maps of cities trying to show how different kinds of cities now exist in the world there 's no there 's no one model of how a city could succeed and if you you look at this map and you you can you see it you see that we 're living in a time when all successful cities are growing the Lord Mayor said this a minute ago that that growth is not in a sense a punishment growth is the reward for being an attractive livable or successful city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will attract more citizens a city that provides good public services will attract more citizens a city that offers the possibility ability for people of different ages to live in the same place whilst pursuing distinct lifestyle choices will attract more citizens if you like growth is not just as it was something that occasionally happens to a few places it 's the best cities that attract the most population and the world is very very rapidly urbanizing you will be aware I think that we 're about one third of the way through a one century cycle in which the human race is moving from being roughly 25% living in cities to roughly 85% living in cities and that 's not a trend that you or I or anyone else can change or reverse all we can do I think is to recognize that people are moving to cities because opportunity is moving to cities and if we 're living in a city where more people are coming the only question is are we going to manage that well or are we going to not manage that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this what you see in the middle is this big 7 the as it were the old world cities the cities who have been successful in the last 25 years but who now are experiencing the problems of inflation in the housing market poor air quality congestion infrastructure stress the problems that come when population growth is much greater than the capacity of the city to respond and if you look to the right-hand side of this map you 'll see the emerging world cities the that the SAU Paolo 's the Mumbai 's the Shanghai 's cities for whom the population growth in the 70s and the 80s and the 90s was much more than they could stand and they ended up with people living in slums they ended up with people experiencing terrible poverty and many of those cities are trying to make good now so Shanghai of course is investing hugely in its transport systems and Sao Paulo is doing the same thing and then if you look on the left-hand side you have these these new world cities the cities that are in a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second time in their history attracting population growth for the first time perhaps and looking to find a new way of managing that growth so that they can grow in a way that 's successful so that they can produce what we might call good growth and what this good growth means I think is finding ways to grow that don 't have these unintended consequences of pollution and sprawl and traffic congestion and a two-tier labor market and housing costs rising all of the time and all of these things that produce it were opposition to the growth model among citizens so I 've been trying to think about these new world cities and thinking about if Brisbane is Australia 's new world cities who news world City which are the other ones and what 's their model of success and this leads us to think about what what are the kinds of things they do what are the jobs that they have what are the opportunities that they provide for young people and for older people and part of the promise of a new world city is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to work in jobs that are right at the top of the industry that you 're working in you won 't have to leave in order to succeed that 's part of the promise of a new world city you don 't have to leave Brisbane and go to Sydney or London or New York or Los Angeles to succeed you can have top jobs in this city and that 's an important part of the promise I think and you can see the kinds of jobs that people do here so there 's a kind of equation that begins to happen and this is in a sense the real definition of a new world city I think these tend to be cities in as I say these words think of Vancouver and San Diego and Cape Town and Barcelona and Auckland and Brisbane these are the new world cities they have great access to natural beauty and the environment they offer a high quality of life with choices about what kind of quality of life you pursue they tend to have well-paying jobs in leading sectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are often well led and well managed metropolitan areas where the borders between the local governments don 't matter too much you can get a single ticket that takes you from one to the other or you can live in one municipality and your children go to school in another these kind of metropolitan areas that try to be borderless they tend to have well coordinated regions like South East Queensland is trying to be good public services and infrastructure investment and they have this global reach in the Internet analyzing sectors that we just described they tend to be well-connected they got good ports good airports railway systems tunnels roads and all the rest of it they have a distinctive brand an identity not just a brand that says we 're a tech capital but also a brand that says we 've got a lifestyle here we 've got something different about us that you can come and be a part of and they tend to have what I call tier assets and anchors institutions universities museums cultural institutions which are well used and well patronized and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a city that has the ability to grow the ability to offer long term job opportunities to young people and to offer different kinds of housing and lifestyle choices to everyone and at the same time can avoid the problems of the old world cities can avoid the problem of being a large city can avoid congestion inflation air pollution infrastructure stress all of those things so that to my mind is what a new world city is and if Brisbane is Australia 's new world city then part of what we 're trying to do here is to plan for brisbin 's growth in such a way that this equation and the promises behind it remain true even as the population grows that 's the tricky thing so for all of these new world cities planning has become a very important thing it 's important to do long term strategic planning thinking about where the city 's going but it 's also very important to do shorter term place planning thinking about particular precincts or particular roads particular pieces of public space or squares and thinking how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what makes a new world city work and this kind of planning only works when it 's collaborative and it 's led by stakeholders just like this event and this wider processes and at the heart of this because the promise of the new world city is such a person thing to its citizens kinds of new deals or new agreements or new charters tend to emerge between these cities and their citizens and I 'm going to talk a little bit about some of those now underpinning all of this is the desire to create what I might call a a positive psychology of growth the idea of this is to say well it 's not that growth means overcrowding or competition for assets or price rises what growth means is the opportunity to translate it into more amenity more vibrant areas it means more customers for the services we want to have and therefore a wider range of services or it means more taxes being paid so there 's more resources to pay for the infrastructures we want to see or more people making our roads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the elimination of no-go areas or quiet zones that make the city difficult and underneath this then there 's whole series of ideas about choice about vitality about vibrancy and the idea that the new world city can be a place that grows and at the same time retains choices and options at the local level about how we live so at one and the same time we can have many more people living in medium rise high quality apartments in the city center and still have people living in traditional suburbs further out those two things are not in contradiction with each other as you 'll see if you go to any Canadian city these days so when you look at the planning of New World cities what are the common features well nearly all of these new world cities are investing decisively in public transport public transport is the thing that makes it possible to accommodate growth without congestion public transport is the thing that makes it possible to open up new locations for housing public transport is the thing that makes it possible for people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quickly public transport makes it possible to enlarge the labor market and the housing market so that everyone can enjoy the opportunities that are otherwise just restricted to some another key thing that emerges in the plans of these new world cities is city center living and urban housing as I said a few minutes ago complementing the traditional suburban housing model with a new kind of urban vibrancy or vitality in the city center where a growing population base in good quality medium density housing supports a range of amenities that are then also enjoyed by workers and visitors and others shop staying open later cafes bars and restaurants becoming more expansive a wider range of entertainment facilities museums and galleries staying open during the evening and at weekends as it were creating the kind of city that becomes more visible and more enjoyable for everyone who works there or wants to visit because there 's a residential population in place a third key idea that comes out of all of these plans is the need for much better public space green space open space water France these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets more population the public space the open space becomes much more important resource it needs to be well managed well curated good signage we need to create more public space using car parks we don 't need or derelict sites that are not being used at the moment we need to create accessibility from one public space to another so the city becomes more walkable in a certain way but so that the public space adds up together and creates more a fourth feature of the planning of these new world cities is the creation of specialist discs districts and precincts as I said before the trick of the new world city is to have some of the top jobs in some of the leading sectors that are driven by new technologies and to combine that with all of the other jobs that come from having a great visit herbal city with good public services so it means that in some locations in the city you want to see a concentration of jobs that are related to health and medicine or jobs that are related to earth sciences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries and digital platforms and other kinds of industries that wouldn 't otherwise be there and by bringing those things together the big institutions and the businesses and the workers together with the nice public space and the amenity you create an identity for that sector you create a visibility for it at the local level it gives confidence to people that there will be jobs for time to come and it enables others then to invest in the success of the city the fourth thing that we see or the fifth thing excuse me that we see in these new world cities is the kind of new dialog about growth and I 'll be talking shortly about Portland in Oregon but this dialogue about growth is very much what we 're here doing today where you see the idea of how do we make sure that everybody gets to enjoy the amenities of the city wherever they live so the notion of a 20-minute neighborhood the notion of the right combination of schools libraries pools clinics hospitals the right combination of shops of public space of Park area how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key feature of all of the planning that goes on in new world cities so I 'd like to tell you a little bit about some of the ways in which some other new world cities have been thinking about these things and what they 've been able to achieve through their planning processes Portland in Oregon is a kind of famous city in the North American continent because it was the first city to consolidate a metropolitan government so it has if you like the reputation that Brisbane enjoys in Australia as being the city with the consolidated municipal government that 's able to put together services of a scale that wouldn 't be possible if you had rather small municipalities instead and they 've developed this key idea of the 20-minute city and the complete neighborhood this has been a very important thing for Portland because it 's enabled the citizens of Portland to know that wherever you live you 're within 20 minutes of a certain set of particular amenities that everybody should be entitled to and wherever you live you 'll be in a neighborhood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everybody needs and this has been a very important idea in the way that Portland has developed its approach to managing growth and to succeeding Tel Aviv in Israel is one of the world 's leaders in innovative technologies and particularly in the translation of its military and defense technology into the commercial realm and Tel Aviv is growing very very fast but Tel Aviv had the experience for two decades of young people who were living in the city centre enjoying the tech boom as soon as they got married and started to have children moved out into the suburbs and the city was beginning to sprawl so Mayor Ron holiday and his team decided that they would focus through the planning process from the feedback that they got on making city centre living for all this involved a focus on childcare expansion and making childcare affordable focusing on public space and parks focusing on the provision of schools making sure that people could live in apartments but raise children in a way that would be healthy and be affordable and be successful so Tel Aviv has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to making city centre living work for families our friends in Oslo a little bit like Brisbane have been so attractive in terms of their lifestyle that they 've become the fastest-growing small capital city in Europe with 30% popular growth anticipated by 2040 and the realization that because they 're a small city with a small city center dictated by the shape of the water they can 't really simply accommodate more people coming into the city every day by car so a long side a very strong investment in public transport they 've taken the step to gradually reduce the accessibility of the city center to cars continuously now in a process of handing over both car parks and other spaces and whole streets to public use pedestrianisation creating more open space creating more facilities for community use and for markets and although you this may seem a little far-fetched as an idea for Brisbane actually at whatever scale you think about doing this deciding that in in cities its citizens that have rights and not cars that have rights is a very important psychological step forward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of being a new world city for some time they 've created these citizen planning boards which have a strong influence over arts and culture over planning over what 's done with spare Earth space and focusing very much on creating health safety and a kind of livability tackling empty homes improving the way licensing works so that the neighbourhoods retain their local feel and their distinctive lists and then finally in Barcelona one of the great new world cities in the Mediterranean sphere what we 've seen is a pact between the city and the citizens around mobility public safety on the streets reducing the number of people injured cycling walking or or or in cars indeed and trying to focus on keeping people moving around the city and using smart technologies to help mobility work so what I 've been talking about is the idea of a new world city Brisbane as Australia 's new world city and if you like what 's the success model for a new world city and then I 've been trying to tell you some of the common things that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I 've given you some examples of the very distinctive agreements that are reached between the city planners and the citizens about key elements that some of those cities need whether the focus is on the 20-minute city in Portland or whether it 's the city centre living for families in Tel Aviv or the car-free City Centre in Oslo or the citizens planning boards in Vancouver or the pact for mobility in Barcelona the new world city it would seem can succeed if it finds a path to good growth through planning processes and this involves a new kind of coordination the city government working with others to bring together and synchronize the amenities the services and the land uses so that the citizens always get from the planning process what they had a right to expect and to desire and if that happens then what population can be is a means through which cities become even better as they grow thank you very much

be here today to provide you with an update on the progress of the brisbane metro and outline the next exciting phase in the development of the project this includes a commencement of market engagement activities for the Metro V vehicle fleet and the collaborative partnership that will be responsible for delivering the main infrastructure works as you will be aware the Lord Mayor Graham Quirk first announced Brisbane Metro as a solution to the challenges facing brisbin 's bus network in early 2016 in mid-2016 council commenced development of the brisbane of the business case for brisbane metro as part of this consultation with the community and broad range of stakeholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment process in March 2017 Council announced the expanded Brisbane Metro project which delivers a network of high-frequency Metro services to the inner city and suburbs using our existing busway infrastructure in May 2017 council released the projects business case following a 12-month detailed assessment of the benefits costs and impacts of delivering the project development of the business case was informed by an initial round of market sounding with both Australian and international vehicle suppliers and contractors in August 2017 following further economic and financial analysis an updated business case was submitted to infrastructure Australia for evaluation and provided to the state government for their review following this in March 2018 Brisbane Metro was listed as one of six high priority projects on the national infrastructure priority list the only project in Queensland in this agree in May the federal government confirmed a 300 million dollar funding commitment for Brisbane Metro in 20 in the 2018-19 budget Council has committed to funding the remaining capital cost meaning the project is fully funded council has also completed consultation on the draft design report with community and stakeholders marking another important @

council CEO which meets monthly a range of technical working groups with stakeholders from TransLink TMR Queensland Treasury and the cultural precinct also meet regularly as you all have seen for in the video earlier Brisbane Metro is more than just an infrastructure project it 's a cost-effective solution that unlocks the potential of our existing busway infrastructure through five key elements these are new existing and upgraded infrastructure including a new underground station at the cultural center for metro and bus services and a new tunnel underneath Adelaide Street connecting to King George Square station a new fleet of 60 high-capacity Metro vehicles each with the capacity to carry up to 150 passengers that will share the bus way with the existing bus fleet new passenger and

ticketing to speed up journey times and finally high frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network which with more services for suburbs across Brisbane as mentioned engagement with the community and key stakeholders has played a critical role in the development of Brisbane Metro most recently Council released the draft design report for consultation in April the draft design report is a voluntary non-statutory assessment of the project that provides information on the project 's infrastructure operation and construction it also represents an assessment of the benefits and impacts of the construction and operation of Brisbane Metro across the full range of environmental and social matters the draft design report was provided to the state government prior to being released for a five week community consultation period during April and May the project team is in the process of reviewing the feedback from residents and stakeholders and expects to release the outcomes of consultation in the near future we are also working closely with the state government to progress discussion on a range of aspects of the project including land requirements planning and regulatory approvals and operating arrangements council has also worked closely with industry throughout the development of the project during the business case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both vehicle suppliers and contractors this included a delegation of council visit in Europe in 2017 to meet with potential vehicle manufacturers and operators Council has also held briefings with various industry groups and established an industry reference group for the project a diverse range of industry participants have have expressed an interest in Brisbane Metro both locally and internationally with many present today council recognizes the current environment and challenges in delivering Brisbane Metro particularly given the length and breadth of the project feedback from industry has helped inform councils delivery approach to the project I will now provide an overview of councils delivery approach for Brisbane Metro Brisbane Metro alignment consists of two Metro Alliance Metro one from eight Mile Plains station in the south to roam the street station in the CBD and Metro two from the University of Queensland Lake Station in the West to the RB WH station in the north prior to the main construction works

Katherine Laughlin thank you well thank you very much for having me here I I have to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear one of the things I believe is that places are like family in many ways to us so thank you for inviting me away from my crazy uncle family country of the United States I needed a break thank you also for not letting me have CNN in my room I needed a break from that as well and so as you understand the roles that places play in our lives you understand that you have to take the good with the bad in our places and that 's one of the things that we are going to be talking about today so I approach this work very differently my background is in social work and so I 'm not your traditional planner instead I look at the psychology of places how they affect our lives and how by creating great places we can actually optimize not only our places for our people but the people themselves and the economies within them and there 's been a lot of things changing lately in the role that places hold now I 'm a researcher I 'm a social science researcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very complicated place science research and make it livable and understandable on a day to day basis starting with understanding the role of place in our lives I know Maslow 's hierarchy of needs you didn 't see that one coming I imagine but it 's very important to understand that as we grow as humans it 's not very far up the line before you understand that love and belonging to where you live and into the environments that you are in is critical for our achievement to being the best humans we can be that means that the work that you guys are starting today is among the most critical you can do I don 't need to put too fine a point on it when I say that people who do not feel connected to their place in to their environment do not achieve the things that they would want it is one of the leading reasons why either people thrive or just merely survive and if you look at a lot of the social ills that we have I know in my country and around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any social problem is at some point that person fell out of touch or belonging with their environment socialized isolation we have discovered is now even more dangerous to the outcomes of humans than cancer obesity and other critical chronic illnesses that people have and so it 's really important to start a conversation that we 're having today understanding the importance of this work it is truly about visioning your place for the future but it 's also about ensuring the healthy outcomes of us all in this room so it 's important to first understand that now on top of that basic human element that we all share there is some research coming forth that I did others have done that really talks about how the role of place in our lives is changing in very critical ways the first really important difference in the world today of place is that we have I know in my country and other countries around the world we are starting to measure that we have the first generation of talent of young talent who will choose a place over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development everything was centered around the job and so when we think about how do we design places it was very much about how do we encourage jobs because that 's what 's going to make us thrive but now we have young people who will to the horror of their parents I sure you show up in cities that they really want to live in with no job no place to live no plan except a love of that place that they want to be in and this has really changed the way we vision our places because now we have to focus on what are we selling in our place and do people choose our place and in here we 're seeing that they clearly are and so how do we deal with that in this new world of talent choosing place even over job and then I was looking at some of the findings just now that talked about job satisfaction and and you know one of the how low that happiness with their job number was and not too long ago that would have scared leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job you must be automatically not happy in your place what we 're finding is that the opposite is true in that people 's relationship with their job can come in and affect their relationship with their place and vice versa but if people are in love with where they live they will stay in a job they don 't love so because they don 't want to give up the place that they 're in so I deal with a lot of CEOs and folks who are in the job of recruiting and retaining talent and I have to have a conversation about it doesn 't matter anymore how wonderful the job is if when they leave your door they have a miserable experience in your community you are still behind the eight ball so the lines between place and workplace are incredibly blurred this these days so that job and place really live in a different marriage if you will together and a lot of the economic and one of the things I 'm going to talk with you all tonight today about is about the economic vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to clearly make a relationship between how well tourism and economic development go is a function of place quality so it has started earning a place at the economic development table where place quality was not something we would have been historically talking about when you 're talking about what 's making our place great from an economic perspective and now place quality is front and center in those conversations and I also saw a folks talking about community problem solving I because my background is in social work I 've spent my dissertation and a lot of my early work looking at why do some places just seem to do better than other places and for a long time we kind of thought it was civic engagement community involvement social capital and those things do matter but what I 'm here to talk to you about today is that the most predictive thing of community problem solving is really how in love are you with your place and how much do you feel your future tied to the places future because when you have that psychological connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only let things go so far because you know that if the place suffers you will suffer and so those conversations happen hand-in-hand so community problem solving and how one place just takes the same problem and seems to do better than another place what is behind that is strangely a psychological phenomenon of people being in love with where they live in it driving how they feel and how they behave within those spaces in you know we I saw livability and we 're talking quality of life and I always make the joke in the States that it 's sort of like a password that we have at these kinds of events where you say quality of life and the other person says quality of life and you just say it back and forth no one really knows what you 're talking about but you know it when you see it you know and understanding what is quality of life in a really real way and let me break it down for you in a way that makes me understand it from the science quality of life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great place and we know what those are now and I 'm going to share those with you today but having those ingredients is not enough you know in the States we have polls every single day the best place to whatever the best place to raise a child the best place to open a business and strangely maybe we have people moving as a result of a city ranking high on a 1 list or another but here 's the reality it 's only quality of life if it feels like quality of life to you so how could someone who moved to a place that 's supposed to be number 1 and raising a family and hates raising their family there how is that possible because we 're still humans at the end of the day and so we have to match what we want in our place with the place itself so we have to be in that place to understand so when we 're talking about quality of life and in those conversations today we have to be very clear that we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the recipe of a great place because it still needs to feel like quality of life to you it has to be the men of his station of a great place that makes sense for you and finally the research that I led that sort of changed the conversation on what makes a great place and the data that is still being mined to this day seven years later from the last data collection we had I have students all over the world some of which from your country who are doing their dissertations on my data and are working my data and so every day I 'm hearing from someone else who found something new that we didn 't know you know this field of understanding place attachment and what makes a great place is truly a building the plane while you 're flying it kind of endeavor and so we now know things that I didn 't even know a year ago we 're still learning things like whether you buy a house you don 't buy a house whether you start a business don 't start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you see your doctor whether you seek out help when you need it these are all functions partially of your relationship with this place and so every decision that you make from the moment you wake up in the morning to the time you go to sleep and what your night is like in-between is a function of your place and so when I say that this this work is among the most important that it is about planning but it 's also about bringing to bear the human quality of existence that we all deserve you have to also understand that how you feel about your place affects your health outcomes it affects the way that you run your life and so the place power today is at an incredibly all-time high and it 's a bit different than the way we 've always thought about our places and so understanding the power of place as you move forward is critical now one of the things I always say is the reason why I spend so much time talking about that at the beginning and the psychological impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that step this becomes a very clinical exercise and so keeping the why of why we do this work and the importance of this work and the outcomes we create should be at the beginning of every conversation about this so we understand the weight of what we 're trying to do for our places now what is a great place all the time people say to me well what 's your favorite place and I always say my favorite place is the loved place and I know that sounds hokey I get it but what we 're understanding about what makes a great place is central around how people feel about it and let me explain what I mean so I was the lead of the night soul of the community project which studied 26 US city cities over three years we spoke to about 43,000 people and the whole goal of the project was to figure out what makes people love where they live and does it matter and to do that we had to first come up with a metric of understanding how people feel about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would be VIP mayor 's in particular would be very proud of themselves if they even asked about how satisfied are you living here but what we became to understand really quickly is that how do you feel about a place is more than just a function of you being satisfied living there because being satisfied and living in a place does not predict whether or not you will leave it attachment is how much rootedness you have in a place it predicts those behaviors that I talked about earlier starting a family starting a business owning a home if you can afford to own a home going and seeking health when you need it being out being social and if you wouldn 't look at how we measured that satisfaction is only one piece of that puzzle and it 's not really the most important piece of that puzzle the most important thing in deciding whether you have attachment to your place is actually your optimism about the city 's future the places future because residents who feel optimistic about their places future are more likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look at this it 's the perfect place it 's the perfect place for me it 's not the perfect place it 's the perfect place for me I can 't imagine another place that would fit me better than this one a sense of pride and dignity in that environment is very important and I also skipped recommend which has a gross implication in it as we discovered as I was looking at this data and all these things seem to really predict residents behavior the more they felt these things about their city the better they felt about staying in that place except in recent years and maybe you guys can relate the recommend started falling out of the factor it wasn 't loading it didn 't seem to be associated with those other feelings of optimism and feeling like it was the perfect place and so I asked people I said what what 's happening with recommend and they said it 's because we love it so much we 're not telling anybody about it we don 't brag about it because we 're good we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full we 're closed we 're we got it and so something 's very interesting happening in my country where a lot of our cities are losing population and so that 's a different kind of conversation than what you 're having today versus a conversation about how do you maintain your attachment to a place when you see changes coming specifically around growth so I 'll say a little more about that later so these are feelings about a place and if I could go into a city and I could say well your pride is doing great and your optimism is doing great you need to work on feeling like it 's the perfect place for you and I left people would be like how do we do that so what I wanted to try to understand is what are the things about a place that drive those feelings can we measure certain aspects of a place that drive those feelings and you know what we found something quite remarkable besides the essence not wanting to stay on the graph correctly thank god this didn 't happen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found was that there are certain things about a place that inevitably predict that attachment and these cities were as different as Macon Georgia which is a very rural farming community to Detroit Michigan Charlotte North Carolina banking town to San Jose California Philadelphia they were crazy different in every possible way but the same thing showed up over and over in a place in predicting attachment and they were the softer sides of place the things that I see popping up on our surveys that do the live surveys that we just did social offerings the aesthetics and how much all groups feel like they can make a life for themselves there those are the things that drive those feelings and so that 's great but I knew that with a lot of social science and a lot of place science you have to be able to ground these feelings in a so what that matters and so we started looking at a lot of the economic outcomes for a city and to see well are they associated with high levels of attachment and do you know what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it matters for school dropout it matters in teenage pregnancy reduction it matters for preventing drug abuse and addiction but given the time that we did this study in 2008 to 2010 and the economies were falling out of places left and right the most powerful outcome that we found attachment mattered for was local GDP growth not GDP not gross domestic product rich places feeling good about being rich places we 're talking about growing economies we 're talking about growing places which is what mattered to us back then so places that have high levels of this also had high levels of that so feelings started to affect outcomes and if you think about it to certain extent it 's not hard to figure out the train of thought because people who love where they live spend more time in that place they invite other people to come spend time friends and family and things like that they enjoy spending time in that place and where you enjoy spending your time is where inevitably you end up spending your money and businesses and other corporate entities started seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break be able to bring and keep talent here easily and so corporations increasingly because they saw this young talent trend wanted places that were easy sells and so this model started to change the way people thought about the great place now I 'm asking you to do something that is a little bit different than most traditional planners and I understand that what I want us to do with this day and part of the reason why I was brought in here was to sort of put a lens on understanding this attachment phenomenon as key to the work that you 're seeing this is the outcome variable we want to maintain as growth happens and as change happens I hear that you guys love it here and there 's a fear that with change we will fall out of love with our city because either we won 't recognize it anymore it won 't be what we thought it was anymore and so it does matter to view your city through the lens of maintaining that rootedness to your place that you clearly all value and understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those feelings for you so how do you find the great place in your place well I already heard this morning people talking about narrative I call it narrative or brand the things that make you who you are the professor said what is our D what is knowing your DNA of a place in fact the basis of your attachment is in how connected you feel to the story of your place in the DNA of your place but yet the DNA of our places come from a lot of different things one of the mistakes we made in the States is that we started to all assume that the narrative of our place was our industry our economy and when manufacturing left when textiles left when farming took a hit places were in a moment of saying oh if we 're not that what are we now and in times of growth you see cases panicking over a loss of place but we also have to understand that who you are as a place comes from a lot of different sources the question is are you honoring all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day it 's not really about whether a structure gets demolished or preserved it 's about what we 're losing when we lose that structure what does it symbolize as we move forward as a place so holding on to your narrative as you move forward is among the most important things you can do if you care about maintaining the attachment to a place because a place can get bigger and you can still love it there if you still see and recognize your place in the new creation and that is sometimes where the work gets difficult a growth conversation always has to reflect the narrative of the place what is the thing and you can you 've said it we like it to be livable we like the green spaces we like that it 's friendly we like these things and what scares people when a growth thing happens is that we cannot may be both we can 't be bigger and still be the thing that we love most about our place but your narrative much like your strengths is what tells you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is your competitive advantage it is what you have it 's like your fingerprint that no other place can have and unfortunately a lot of people a sieve up their fingerprint when they don 't think it 's going to be good enough to get them through the next phase what I want to make us do today is find a way to hold our finger fingerprint our narrative sacred as we continue to move in a direction of modernization and growth which inevitably does happen to many places now I live in Raleigh North Carolina if you 've ever been to the state come see me I love my place I 'm highly attached I 'm all the stuff I talked about I have kept my accent to a minimum so you could understand me I will break bad on you in a minute though but I love it I truly love it in our place we are always ranked as one of the best cities to do whatever you want to do sometimes in the world but certainly in our in in our states in the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful it has green spaces it 's got southern charm it 's got quality of life we have mission to Mars high technology high innovation a very open environment if you want to drive a car drive a car if you want to ride a bike ride a bike if you want to walk walk whatever you got we 're ready for you there but this is also true about my place every time it snows it 's the end of the world this is a picture that appeared on the cover of every national newspaper in my country when we got two inches of snow in three hours a couple of years ago and none of this is photoshopped this is not a postal road this is our Beltline which for us in the States is the main thoroughfare of driving where everybody uses to get around and yes we had cars on fire people wandering the streets children looking on in horror it was a nightmare in our place children slept in their schools that night because their parents couldn 't get to them and pick them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event was that Fred 's bed sales went up 45% so if you want to tell me that the economy in place have nothing to do with each other why but this picture tells a different story but the reason why I show this is to highlight an important thing about our narrative we have to grow up be very honest about with ourselves about what we 're getting right and what we 're getting wrong both things are aspects of who we are so this I call in the south we call this a bless your heart moment which means like if a southerner if you come to the states and a southerner in particular says he 'll bless your heart it 's not a compliment it 's the the version of being patted on the head and saying please aren 't you just special this is our bless your heart moment we have a lot of them though this is not the only one and this is the most humorous one I can bring forward because we have people moving to my state 500 households a month move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by the same token a lot of them are coming from other places and part of our culture in the south is being welcoming and yes why don 't y 'all come on in but when other people especially from the north the Yankees started showing up in North Carolina they were horrified that I mean our schools were shut down for two weeks after this we just we could not function and they said hey listen we love your place how about we take some snow defensive driving classes and we 'll teach them the Yankees were going to teach us how to drive in the south and we didn 't really appreciate that because we sort of said you know what you wanted to be here right we sit around with all canned goods and clutch our mint juleps and wait for this to pass we don 't learn how to drive in this so either you 're on board with who we are or now off you go and this is one of the things that happens in a place that 's going through change it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the things that you don 't get right you might think are still kind of endearing and you don 't really want them to change and you certainly don 't want somebody coming in from another place telling you that they ought to and so when we talk about our narratives as a place we have to understand what are the things that maybe we don 't get right and how do we feel about changing them even if it 's just our attitudes about having so many more people showing up and kind of telling us what we don 't get right you know it 's sort of like in a marriage or with your parents or with your children you can say all you want about them nobody else better right and what we 're finding is that the way we think about places is not that much different really than how we think about families and our family members and so one of the things I started to create was to really understand the world of place is huge there are so many things on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see who you want to hold on to you want this to get better you want that to get better and it 's overwhelming what I wanted to create was a road map for places to find themselves a broad map for success for their future and by doing that I wanted to create this what you see is this very interesting quadrant here and I don 't want to get too researchy because who needs that but I want to point out two very important factors that I want to affect the way you talk about your issues today and they are for me the most important things that matter because I believe it is the future of places as understanding that attachment that residents feel to their place and hold on to it because it is the beginning of so many wonderful things that we want for our places so it 's about understanding what matters to attaching you here today if you 're like the 26 cities that I 've studied previously it 's some function of the social offerings of the aesthetics and feeling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place for themselves here so what are the things for you that drive your attachment today but this is only half of the equation the other thing that you absolutely have to know is well how are we doing on those things because if you just know the things that matter for attaching you you don 't know how you 're doing on those things you might be doing great you might not but by the same token if you only know what you 're doing great on but you don 't know whether it matters to drive your feelings then you 're still behind the eight ball so to to strategize and to understand where are we going as a place you have to focus on these two ideas what drives your attachment to the place and how are you doing on those things how do you perceive this community doing and that brings up a very important point a lot of the places that I work in we 're not building a better mousetrap we 're not building new stuff what we 're doing is changing perceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store immediately okay we need more of this we need less of that when is it that you need more or less of that or is it that people don 't have the accurate perception of the reality of living there because perception is reality so sometimes our work is about changing perceptions about a place because in actuality it 's doing better than you might think now there 's always those very scary places where people think the place is doing really great on safety and their crime numbers are horrendous and you 're thinking wow I 'll pull that off that 's that 's impressive but getting people to understand the difference between perception and reality is very is a very important first stop to these conversations so what do we get when you put this in a matrix what you get is understanding your strengths I don 't want today to be about what are we not getting right I want today to start about what are we getting right what are the things that we do that we 're doing well at what are the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well at and from what I heard this morning green spaces the kind of friendly laid-back atmosphere so when you know what drives your attachment to the place and things that you 're doing well then you know your strengths what do strengths buy you that tells you your brand which matters for tourism it matters for these lovely slogan cities are coming up with it helps you understand your marketing your tourism because believe me the place conversation these days is all about not only about residents loving it here but tourists loving it here and who 's your number one audience for a tourist and for tourism your residents because if y 'all ain 't buying what they 're selling they 're already falling off the cliff right so understanding what are your strengths and then your opportunities these are the things that matter for attaching you here but you 're not feeling it like you used to or you 're not feeling it and you never have this is where what we talk about place making happens this is where you work on projects this is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we need to change reality this is where the work happens unfortunately a lot of times cities spend time down here things that don 't matter for attachment and they spend the lion 's share of their time thinking about it what is down there well what is down there are the things that every city has to do to some extent garbage collection pothole repair things that you sort of think you 're going to get from a city but doesn 't drive whether or not you 're in love with it or not and so when you spend all your days here you 've completely missed the boat of the opportunity of really galvanizing place together so as you walk move forward today please think about what are our strengths what are our opportunities as a place and how can we leverage what we 're getting right to help with what we 're not getting right strengths should be front and center to every conversation you have at your tables or on those boards how does strengths play into this right here what we 're getting right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another tip and I just said it you have to lead with your strengths and you have to know the difference between perception and reality perception is what matters like it or not but how can you adjust the perception to be more reflective of their reality if that 's truly the issue so I wrote a book about how we date and marry our places the scary thing about dr. Catherine Laughlin is I started as a marriage and family therapist I know run for your life and what I found when I started doing so loved the community is that our journey to find the place where we belong and maintain that relationship it 's a lot like dating in marriage I know but the reality is people date your place people marry your place people divorce your place people have sad places that 's called tourism and the fact is is that when people are learning about who you are are you easy to get to know or do you put yourself out there people are usually especially young people in particular they take three to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and so doing that I always tell mayor 's you know and a lot of my cities that are trying to grow can you imagine they 're trying to grow theirs I said you got three to five years to attach them and how are you as far as a dateable City something we talk about married people who are married to the place are these it 's highly attached people they are the ones who have made an emotional physical and sometimes financial investment in being tied to the future of that place and when people decide that they 've made that commitment to their place what 's interesting again from a shrinks perspective is that we start producing chemicals in our body that want to sustain the environment that is providing us a quality life experience that we want becomes that symbiotic relationship and so how do you maintain this marriage when bad times come and to some people growth is not an exciting time it 's not about whether or not we will always survive it 's about whether we 'll be resilient so today your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength based in our approach and lastly I have to say I don 't want y 'all competing with anybody else I want you to figure out how you can be the best Brisbane you can be I don 't really want you to spend your time trying to be and compare with another city that doesn 't have what you have as a competitive advantage to be good enough because the moment you 've decided the only way you can be good is to be like someone else you 've given up on the place that has given you so much so please only think about how we can be the best best Brisbane that we can be we will be around all day and I 'm very glad that again you 've given me a break from my country so I can enjoy and and love being loved at this place you call home thank you for thank you thank you so much doctor lovely","(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"
AUS,QLD,Brisbane City Council,Brisbane City Council,https://www.youtube.com/c/BrisbaneCityCouncil1,Plan Your Brisbane Intergenerational Forum - Greg Clark,9rELCIi6ML4,20171212,1770.97,"Brisbane City QLD 4000, Australia",4582,he is a global recognized leader in city planet planning and investment urban regiment regeneration urban metropolitan planning and regional transport Professor Greg Clark will explore some of the biggest challenges that face all modern cities including Brisbane now Greg is in London we 're going to be able to speak with him in a little while but he has prepared for us a video that we 're going to enjoy together and then we will cross over to to London and speak to him so here is Professor Greg Clark good morning to Lord Mayor Graham Quirk and to everyone at the plan your Brisbane intergenerational forum this morning I 'm professor Greg Clark from London I apologize I 'm not able to be with you today but I 'm delighted to send this pre-recorded presentation to you and also to participate live in the QA with the Lord Mayor in a few minutes I 'm going to talk to you about 15 slides really to set the scene for why cities like Brisbane need to plan actively for their future and to think about how the intergenerational dimension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can become very important on slide two of my presentation I really try to observe that we 're living in a very unusual time this is the century of urbanization from roughly 1980 to roughly 2080 a hundred year Trek is occurring where the human race is essentially becoming urbanized moving from 20% urbanized to 80% urbanized during that hundred year period and what that means is that in the poor parts of the world cities are growing from scratch in the medium income parts of the world larger cities are growing and smaller towns are becoming major cities and in the advanced part of the world the richer countries the OECD members including Australia people are moving back into cities and cities are connecting with their regional cities and towns to produce managed metropolitan regions which are increasingly accommodating not just the population growth but also the business growth and the job creation as businesses move back to cities as well now this of course gives rise to lots of challenges in terms of city planning city management creating cities that are really fit for the future and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices that they need but the interesting thing about this century is that it also is synchronized with some other trends the first one is of course that the human population will stabilize during this century at just under 8 billion people and therefore what happens during the next 30 years the middle part of this century will set in train a pattern if you like of human settlement of connectivity of trade visiting that will last for a long time the second thing of course is that this century is synchronized with the climate emergency in the need to move towards a greener cleaner lifestyle and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as to improve air quality more generally and then the third thing of course is that this is synchronized with the emergence of new ubiquitous exponential technologies from energy and battery technology through to new food technologies but of course the new digital technologies including artificial intelligence Big Data the Internet of Things autonomous vehicles and many many other kinds of new technologies so if you like the challenge of our time is to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive for citizens and at the same time to tackle climate change and move towards more map more managed metropolitan areas which are able to succeed now on slide three and I set out what I think are three big choices here and to put them very simply for the well to accommodate this shift towards the urban areas we can either firstly allow the existing cities to or secondly we can build lots of new cities and towns as they 're doing in in in China and in the Middle East and in parts of Latin America or thirdly we can take our existing cities and we can help them to grow and develop within their existing boundaries through targeted and smart densification and by connecting up metropolitan areas one to another in other words we deliberately build our cities to be more focused more concentrated and better connected to one another now the first option of sprawl is the one of course that 's been the default option for about the last 100 years and nearly all wealthy countries have had sprawling cities but we 've now become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of new cities option 2 is a great idea in a certain respect but the consequences upon established cities have not been good in countries like China and in Brazil and in the Middle East where the established cities have been abandoned in favour of the new cities leaving only the poorest or the least mobile populations in the old cities the third option managed densification and improving the infrastructure and connectivity of existing cities to create smarter more compact cities and better connected metropolitan areas has by review of all the evidence the biggest advantages in terms of economy society and environment better for people better for the planet and also better for business in slide 4 I try to articulate some of the different kinds of cities that are emerging as a result of this century that we 're in and on the one hand you have in the top left-hand corner the established world cities the London 's the New York 's the Hong Kong 's the cities that really specialized in the globalizing sectors in the last cycle finance and business services professional services of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture you can see the emerging world cities the Shanghai 's the Mumbai 's the South Paolo 's the big cities that are the junction boxes between the fastest-growing and large economic nations and the global economy in these cities very large cities on the whole trying to become high quality environments for those globalised activities and then in the top right hand corner we have what we call the new world cities this is a group of cities that combine specialization in a high quality of life often with wonderful natural assets they 're usually medium-sized cities that are well managed and well run with good infrastructure good public services and a great environment and they combine that with specialization in the sectors that are now globalizing because of this new generation of technologies that I referred to earlier and on slide five of course we can see that the city that invented the idea of being a new world city is Brisbane Australia 's new world city and it was my reading of this strapline this slogan this mission statement for Brisbane that allowed me to start thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are the other ones and that 's led to the categorization that you saw on the previous chart now on slide 6 we talk about how these new world cities succeed and you can see that the key thing about these new world cities is that they managed to combine high quality of life with high quality of jobs and those jobs are largely in sectors that are globalizing at the moment and they put that together with a very well managed city that is organised planned has good infrastructure excellent public services and then allows them to attract and retain people and their skills and it particularly means that for young people who grow up in these cities they don 't have to leave in order to succeed it 's possible for three generations of the same family to live in one of these new world cities and do well whereas if those cities don 't embrace the opportunities of global ization they often up end up with their young people needing to leave and grandparents becoming separated and dislocated and from them so the new world city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same city prospering living together at the same time as maintaining high quality of life in slide seven we simply compare Atlanta and Barcelona these are two cities of the same size both of them would like to be seen as new world cities but Barcelona has been much more effective than Atlanta in putting in place the infrastructure the built environment the quality of place to enable it to have a compact urban form six-story apartment blocks it 's not a high density city it 's a medium density city but with a wonderful quality of life dividend that comes in the form of vibrancy vitality great public space great amenities shops restaurants cafes all of the things that are a positive side effect from having identified urban for slide eight we observe some of the challenges that occur when cities grow quickly pollution congestion obviously inflation particularly in the housing market many other challenges and of course it 's these challenges and how we address them what we might call the externalities or the the unintended consequences or side effects of growth that are very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new kind of strategic planning that 's necessary in our city strategic planning that engages citizens and businesses that is led by vision is able to identify catalytic interventions infrastructure projects and other things that are very important and involves partnerships between different tiers of government and this is what plan your Brisbane is all about moving to a strategic planning approach as well as maintaining the good tradition of active and well-run city planning slide 10 shows you that Brisbane of course is alone being part of the southeast Queensland region provides Brisbane with advantages in terms of scale but also complementarity with other locations that are able to specialize in particular kinds of offers and therefore connectivity between Brisbane and the rest of southeast Queensland is very important also to managing growth in slide 11 I talked about the importance of infrastructure and managed growth and how if we have managed growth we 're able to concentrate activities in certain locations and that gives rise to opportunities to improve infrastructure and as we improve infrastructure therefore we 're able to develop specialized and concentrated activities in particular parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide 12 where the Metro project there the Lord Mayor 's proposition about these high-speed dedicated bus tram vehicles that will enable Brisbane to increase the efficiency of its labor market improve the capacity of its housing market but also very importantly open up a number of particular locations around the city specific precincts or districts which are able to accommodate specialized activity or both in terms of jobs but also in terms of amenities and facilities for citizens to enjoy so infrastructure projects like the Metro project underpinning a new way of planning and developing a compact high quality high vitality city an in slide 13 we talked about Bilbao an example of a city that 's really done this and used its metro project and its urban regeneration and its development of its neighborhoods to create a new image of the city a new identity as a great place to live a wonderful place to study superb environment to visit and increasingly a hub of creative and digital industries in specialized locations that are supported by its metro project that has been so important slide 14 simply reminds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and its citizens as the city increases its population and as it tries to manage that population growth in a way which is environmentally and socially progressive or efficient it 's very important to build a a popular story a positive psychology about growth and that means I think having a conversation with citizens about what are the amenities we want what are the services we want to see how do we want our public spaces to work how do we want to develop the districts that are better connected by the new infrastructure projects how do we make sure that by having more people living in the same space we get a better quality of life with additional amenities additional vitality more choices more option more opportunities for people rather than just an experience of crowding and congestion and everything else and so this positive psychology of popular growth is a very important part of our conversation slide 50 in the final slide here 's a wonderful map of Brisbane that was part of the Lord Mayor 's launch of the precincts strategy a month ago when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the benefits of this kind of managed planning that enables us to put together a plan that produces infrastructure in the right locations enabling people to move creates neighborhoods of choice where people want to live but also creates precincts of specialization where we 're able to cluster together advanced businesses that can be more productive by being close to one another can create more jobs and more opportunity for citizens and at the same time create distinctive districts that then become visible at the global level attracting international investment and jobs in ways that they might not otherwise do that 's what I wanted to say to you this morning I look forward to the Q&A I hope that you will enjoy the conference too day and thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to speak to you so now you have an opportunity if you have any questions for professor Greg Clark this is a gorgeous excellent am I on ok I 'm quite frustrated by what you said professor Clark because you 've ignored in respective Brisbane the elephant in the living room namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisoned behind this mountain ranges of rock mountain range and I foresee gone a goondiwindi Toowoomba aroma being the next big competitor urban or conner urban entity connected with Melbourne via the inland rail the Australia 's a new steel Mississippi and I believe that there 's going to be a competition I believe that these that the Darling Downs is going to be closer to Melbourne than it is to Brisbane because of this insufferable barrier the Great Divide escarpment oh please worry about that if you wish I 'm not sure if professor Clark is purpose is as well versed in the topography of the rest of the state and while I think we could probably take that as a comment and allow professor Clark to to make comment about if he can give given that it may be outside the scope of what he 's aware of we might then draw the conversation back to the urban development of the city which was obviously the the vast majority of the information he shared with us but if you 'd like to make comment professor Clark Sophie I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'd be interested to know more on my next visit what I would say though is that rail corridors between the major cities of Australia are a key part I think of the agenda over the next 50 to 100 years and it 's very clear from not just what what 's happening in South East Queensland but what 's also happening in New South Wales and the development of some of the corridors there that Australia pence spending more time and attention thinking about how to connect these cities up so that we genuinely get some choice and some opportunity to move between them more frequently during the course of a day it 's going to be very important to the long-term prosperity of the country and perhaps I 'll leave that general comment there thank you anyone else have a question yes thank you yes professor thank you and and councillor quirk this question is sort of directed to the planning department but actually does support you and what you have actually said about the future of planning and how we need to avoid what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China and things like that in creating sort of slums within communities if you like you know like the Bronx in New York and things like that fortunately the Planning Department is still proceeding along those lines within Brisbane and within a specific area you know on the on the south side of Brisbane around Forest Lake they have created a large low-cost housing which we all agree we do need but clustering them together we currently have three right next to each other with further plans for another three and more coming along within those developments they are exceeding the current 36 per hectare dwelling recommendation set out by council and going to 41 and beyond with no requirements within these developments to create extra parking or they are sort of communities within themselves and they should have communal aspects such as barbecue areas pools you know little parks whatever so therefore they 're creating then the negative antisocial behaviors of hooning drug addiction because of their the people that are going in there with no release and encouragement to become part of the community so we do support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid those kind of communities and certainly clustering them to create a large suburb of this low cost antisocial kind of communities does nobody across Brisbane any good so I 'd like to put that to the Planning Department as to why they persist in allowing these negative type plans within a community just supporting what he 's saying I didn 't really hear a question specifically for me but perhaps what I would just say is that I 'm sure that it 's not the intention of the Planning Department to concentrate poor people all in one neighborhood actually professor club of course many examples of cities around the world where well I was going to ask you I lived in San Francisco for the better part of seven years two of my children were born there are you aware or could you speak perhaps particularly to that issue about some of the ways that San Francisco has been able to overcome that with the initiatives of being able to help people afford to get into dwellings in the city are you aware of that well there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course this kind of approach has been taken in in Amsterdam as well and in Barcelona and Stockholm also in Miami another very interesting City where you know one of the things that happens is as the population of a city grows very rapidly we need very quickly to build housing to accommodate sometimes that results in people being clustered in certain locations and if everybody of the same income is in the same place it means there will be areas where poor people are concentrated we know that that 's not healthy for a city in the medium term or the long term and so the combination of interventions in the housing market that help people to buy into living mixed income neighborhoods interventions by planning departments to create more mixed up income neighborhoods and a much stronger focus on public transport is really important for enabling people to move out of those areas and every successful city has a place where people come when they enter the city deeply if they enter as or people when they come and the city needs to have zones that are affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong City a successful City provides people with opportunities to move out quickly and it creates a neighborhoods of mixed income where people can make together and that 's really in the longer term the kind of thing you want to see fantastic Michel would you have a question yep I was about to say you can speak into my chest but I don 't mean it to be inappropriate I 'll stand and do it right ridley professor do you have examples around the world where the successful elimination of of cars within the city precinct has been achieved and alternative transportation solutions from it from the boundary within the city itself yes well nearly all of the new world cities that I was talking about are moving towards a different mo mix in terms of transport and that includes of course initiatives to promote cycling and walking in other kinds of active transport it includes great investment that 's happening in public transport but in cities like Stockholm in Singapore of course in London and increasingly now in surprising cities like Denver and Houston and Miami the reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases this is because a payment system is being used what might be called a congestion charge or roads only two cars going into city centers in other cases it 's simply that roads are blocked off certain times of day to car use so this will sound a funny thing to say to an audience in in South East Queensland in Brisbane but the world is really falling out of love with the motorcar in a very particular way and people are I think sick of the long commutes people are also very worried about the air quality in cities these days and the impact that has on the health of young people and older people and increasingly now we see cities such as those I 've mentioned taking really decisive action to reduce car use in City and making it a much more a much more incentivized system to replace car use in the city centre with other kinds of public and active transport it goes back to that fabulous final slide that you had to Professor Clark where we talk about community hubs and opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have the old-fashioned view of everybody needs to go into the city to do everything work live and play and instead we start to create communities within the city well you 're absolutely right Sophie and of course the biggest change that is almost invisible because happened by stealth in every city is the increase in the number of people living in the city center and we know that by having a residential community living in this city center not only reduces the number of people traveling by car in and out of the city center but it increases the attractiveness the vibrancy and the vitality of the city sector it means that the cafes and restaurants are fuller the art galleries and the libraries have better used the swimming pools are more attractive for public spaces are better so having a residential community in the city center what the Americans would call downtown is a really important step in creating a city center that all the citizens of the city actually want to use and then if we couple that with the kind of transport solutions we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands we have one more question for professor club before we let him go and move on I might go yeah we have been sorry there 's a microphone there in the middle of the room yes good morning professor clerk I just wanted to know how I 've just been to Shanghai recently and I was very impressed by the way that they maintained part of the history of that city and they also seem to encourage green space that made parts of that city very pleasant to be in the thing that I am worried about and I think a lot of residents in Brisbane are worried about is that we are losing the character of our city and we live in a subtropical climate and I think the character of our city needs to be celebrated and I ask you how do you go about maintaining that character that gives your city a point of difference well it 's a fantastic question and I 've written a lot of reports on this subject but I think thing I would say is that Brisbane is a city that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course its River and when I visit Brisbane I always try to spend time near the river walking around the river cycling near the river because the River provides the fundamental rationale for the city but it also provides much of its character its geography the different settlements that have existed around it so I think my first message would be that you need to really understand the DNA of your city have really celebrated and enjoy tonight know that in Brisbane the river is loved by everyone you celebrated actively and then I think it 's very important to have a neighbor of the dimensions of the way planning works and to focus on celebrating the neighborhoods and giving their personality and their character a chance to really come out so lots of neighborhood level festivities and activities and history trails and things of that kind are very important and that the third thing of course is to realise that these things really work well when we have active citizens groups community organizations and others working to look after neighbourhoods and arts and public spaces although of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brisbane do a good job to maintain public space the animation of the public space requires the citizens by the way this is no less true of your business precincts and your business districts your shopping streets your entertainment district they also need to be actively managed and the business community of the land owners also have a very key role there so the key thing is really to understand the DNN a celebrate what you really have let people who come to Brisbane as new citizens enjoy it and learn about and understand really bitter to be Australia 's new world city you have to be in a certain sensor one of Australia 's old cities and to really respect that heritage and you enjoy it thank you very much for allowing me to participate this morning my best wishes to the Lord bear and to all of the councillors and thank you particularly to saw women Marucci whose is welcome I really enjoyed thank you thank you put your hands together for professor Clarke for joining us from London [Applause],"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"

Wharf redevelopment he also contributes to improving our city in his role as an adjunct professor of design at the University of Queensland sorry of the Queensland University of Technology so please make James tomber very welcome head it back to front of me thank you all very much and thank you so much for the invitation to speak today my intent today is to be fairly Pacey because I do firmly believe that today is not about me talking at you it 's about giving you some information perhaps some perspectives and all of you actually started to generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the things that I 'd like to talk about probably are less about suggestions and more about observations that might hopefully help you unlock some principles of your own around what you value and what you might see as the future of the city as we move forward I do have a confession to make though I was born here I was educated here I lived on the south side and the north side and in the western suburbs I did travel the world I worked in New York and London and Europe and Asia but I did come home and I was always gonna come home because a bit like the doctor was speaking about before I have an amazing place attachment to Brisbane I am accused occasionally being a reckless optimist but I think the future of Brisbane is so bright but when posing the question about why like we 've been to myself in the in the wee small hours of the evening I wondered why that actually was and to me in this sorry personal view it 's about our capacity for change actually so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abouts and it 's what always Marv I marvel out of this image is it 's clearly Brisbane so all the buildings are different the landscapes slightly different but Kangaroo Point the CBD Peninsula whole range of things are clearly distant which actually to me is really that whole idea of what are the things that we really value about the city and what has to stay to make it charismatic to sustain a unique character to make it the Brisbane we all know and love but then by implication one of the things that we can change to actually capture the opportunities of the professor and the doctor talked about previously and changes coming these aren 't my recommendations this is the ABS recent national census about population growth and sure it 's statistics and you all know that saying about lies damned lies and statistics but what it 's showing though is irrefutable population growth particularly in the core of the city but you know in other places as well based around good planning based on infrastructure and all those other sorts of things so I suppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an option we have a serious amount of population growth in wood investment a whole range of change occurring but the great thing about that is it 's now our decision as a group as a citizenry as a population of the city to actually figure out how we want to accommodate that how we want to deal with that what are the choices we want to make so looking at Brisbane and what it was and what it might be the image on the left clearly is an image of early last century you can see again there 's some quite distinctive qualities and the universal thing about the city other streets and spaces it 's a public realm of the things that tend not to change and I think they 're really fertile ground for conversations we move forward moving ahead though we did a little exercise in our office and again this is not a plan for the future it 's just a brain explosion from some young people in our office but it 's an idea about what Brisbane might look like in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our organization to paint that picture and what they focus on their focus on the river life I guess on fun they focus on amenity they focus on big buildings Shore but they focus on the architectural quality of those the design quality and most importantly the landscape the river is a really important part of the city 's City the city 's story it is actually why we are here it 's entirely the reason mercantile tried environmental and others and and I think that 's a really important central point to discuss as we move through the course of the coming day and the coming period and the river for me and I will confess of love of the river and of boats and a range of other things so I am again in tightly biased I love Brisbane and I love water but the river is actually the central tenant of the entire city for me it has so much potential in relation to fund relation to access to canoes to sailing to fun on the water to transport solutions to a whole range of other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access strategy the river 's edge strategy are all part of that story but I think as we move forward we think about Brisbane in 25 years time that the Brisbane that our children will inherit I think the river needs to play a much more significant role the image of our city too is really important I think and it 's been characterized by many artists over the last century or century and a half and the image on the left is the sort of quintessential image I mean clearly not all suburbs look exactly like that and they 're not all on a hill like I believe that 's red hill potentially Pennington but it is something that is dear to our heart that image of the city and we think about though what that means and then we look at where the city is going and there 's always amazing new precincts coming to an image on the riders will propose how Smith wharves and from my perspective that 's no less Brisbane and the image on the left it 's about lightweight lightweight lightweight architecture it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's a very different model a very different type ology and I think that 's really the nub of the question today what is it that we love do we want to keep and therefore by implication where could where 's the flexibility how do we meet and rise to the challenges but create a place that we still love and feel engaged with thinking about neighborhood character this is a very loose diagram but it 's really you just think if you think about the city and how well this particular the central city and I do acknowledge that there is other parts of the city that we haven 't had time to look at in preparation for this or for my presentation but there 's a whole lot of things going on this centre so there 's local places where you go and buy milk and bread or go to the community hall or go to church to do all those other sorts of things and there 's also places where people lived in high-density some in lower densities some in timber and tin some in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those things together there is actually no one image of Brisbane which is a real interesting thing because on the previous slide we talked about timber and 10 and fig trees and all those sorts of things but actually if you systematically look at the city there is no one image and that 's the other great thing about Brisbane it 's diverse and there 's a whole range of choice and there 's a whole range of images and all of those are important and mean something to all of us in terms of the heritage what I find really interesting about the heritage again is this idea of the timber and tin being quintessentially Queensland I wanted to hold on to it and this is a personal view so no one should get to affronted as I say if I don 't think it 's actually the architecture we value I think it 's actually the proportion of landscape to building its the ability to move from indoors to outdoors it 's the idea that something 's climatic climatically relevant and it 's the idea that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the values that are really important as opposed to necessarily the tin and timber building itself and that plays out in places like James Street for example where clearly there 's a contemporary architecture or design response to that but it has breezeways it has landscape it has a great environmental performance of those human scale has big trees and to me these are some of the things design quality design trade-off so we need to think about I don 't think there 's anything wrong with having an incredibly contemporary city with great precincts but it does need to have those intrinsic characteristics which to me aren 't timber and tin they 're landscape and they 're shade and the whole range of other things I 'm streets and spaces are important too and a lot of things going on the city to think about as you move forth through the course of today first is the urban spaces so streets Edward Street has been finished by council if you haven 't seen it gonna have a look it 's fantastic I think it 's the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we have you know suburban Park to remove front parks other things going on too so we need to think about what it is we value about all of those and really interestingly we talk a lot about open space in the city and the fact we need more my personal view again happy to be challenged on this later is I don 't think it 's an issue of quantity I think it 's an issue of access and relevance which is to say how easy is it for me to get to one of those green spaces and when I get there how welcoming is it and how relevant are the facilities do what I want to do so it 's about performance rather than the amount of space and the way I test that is that whenever I go to a local park with my son I look at the whole range of things and he always actually just goes to usually the most undesigned piece of it like a storm water drain or somewhere else goes clunk doesn 't climbs a tree completely ignores the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's actually a better opportunity and the performance of the space rather than whether it 's one hectare or one and a half act is to me that 's actually technically irrelevant but it 's a personal view others will have a different view subtropical landscape really important we hopefully all know about the buildings that breathe design guidelines which really focus on creating a really clear architectural image for our city newfound Park on the Left one of our great green spaces there are many others but what 's really interesting is as we become more intense as a city more dense how do we use landscape and smash that idea together with architecture and urban and other things to create vertical landscape to create buildings that are actually contributing to the green comfortable laid back casual subtropical sense of the city without necessarily being a park but by being a three-dimensional tower or building small or large and to me it 's all these other things that we do that actually going to define the future of the city the character of the city and going back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me personally as a citizen of Brisbane the idea of place attachment that idea of landscape and buildings being and blurred and we 're really good at urban renewal by the way I go around the country and I work internationally and quite a bit as well I think Brisbane in my humble opinion does Evan renewal and precinct development betting that the better than any other city I 've ever been to we are so good at making something out of nothing South Bank is an example gasworks is an example Tenerife is an example sorry nothing 's a big pool there 's things there but my point is we invent ourselves and reinvent ourselves and a deal with change really positively every day and I think that 's a really great heritage an armory for the citizens of Brisbane to use and have confidence in our ability to imagine a really strong future and to deliver that the other dimension to that is economic which is to say clearly buildings are important and public spaces are important and all the survey work and interactive sessions this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic social dimension to this as well and the idea of where will all this change happen how do we facilitate it in a plan to Greg Clark 's point organised systemic systematic way and there are some suggestions and some recently released strategies from council which I think right on right on point there globally relevant they relate to the river they relate to our specific skill sets our labor markets our climate and a whole range of other things to actually start to think about where are the more intense development areas in the city that might actually start to employ a young creative people stop young people moving away increase net migration create great spaces improve at global competitiveness but there are challenges too as we move into the future traffic clearly that came up a lot as well in some of the earlier discussions but there are massive opportunities around that in terms of driverless cars artificial intelligence and yeah as an example what would happen if all cars in the CBD were actually drive us in the future what we do with all the basements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could they be affordable housing would all the streets actually turn into parks they 're all kind of extreme examples and you could argue other way whether they 're real or not but there are many great questions in front of us that all of this change and it 's really nerve-wracking but there is potential around that to actually use that stuff to our advantage to grade a city that we want the city of our dreams the city that were all attached to in a city that we love hopefully as much as I do so lastly I just wanted to summarize by saying that from my perspective change is coming I don 't think as I said doing nothing is an option we have to acknowledge that is happening but we need to control how we deal with that our strategies around that I think the River City thing is a big deal and I think focusing on the river I 'm locking that amenity using that as part of the toolkit that we have to address it and meet these challenges is really important heritage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually physically about it what it is it 's about the stories the communities the relationship to landscape the climate and other things there 's actually really important design quality for me as it 's essential I think it 's okay to deliver density but it needs to be done really well this idea of dialogues important and I know this is the very early stages of dialogue with the city around principles for the future of planning but it is really important that this continues to happen and we all have a voice and we all hear each other 's voice and we come to a point where we agree a whole series of great things about Brisbane that we want to keep and by implication the great things about risen that we think we can change thank you thank you so much James [Applause],"(-27.4704528,

Recruitment",BR5C0fNX4j4,20151006,711.98,"Brisbane City QLD 4000, Australia",2549,right when I thought we might start the beginning if we could perhaps you can tell me a little bit and the audience a little bit about how you went about starting your own business I be recruitment was it scary was it exciting and then if and then of course what you a little bit more about what you do ok so I started IV recruitment in 1992 when I was 12 okay are you getting that and I started it up because I did see in need for banking finance specialist in Brisbane and my recently met my husband and I think one of the big things you need when you have a business is support and my husband was amazingly supportive and said you can do this you actually making a lot of money for someone you should be making it for yourself so I started our beer recruitment and I was lucky again because my husband 's a banker so he would actually look after all the money side and I just did what I do best which is recruitment and it sort of grew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up over the overdraft limit new thinking good god what 's going to happen here and you 're waking up at two o 'clock in the morning crying thinking is this going to come down what 's going to happen one of the things I did do in the first three months i looked at my clients and i realized at eighty-five percent of my work was with one client and I realized you just can 't do that you have to you have to diversify so I went out there as hard as I could and I got a whole lot of clients on in different industries in different areas to make sure that if one fell over I had lots of other clients to call ok so you spoke a little bit about you 've continued to grow the business from bum from those beginnings so there 'd be plenty of SMEs in the room who are looking or have an ambition to grow their business if not doing it right now so what are the some of the challenges that you faced as you were growing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good staff even I make mistakes occasionally and also you know there were probably challenges to having children having a business because I wanted to be a good mother and I mentioned put up your hands if you 're a mother in the room because if you 're a mother and you 're trying to run a business it is very difficult and it 's a matter of working out the time you spend a business and the time you spend with your children so no one misses out and usually you just miss out so I think probably finding good that could be there when I wasn 't there in order to keep growing the business and and building it in different areas i think that was probably a big thing okay and you as you 're going through the challenges you talked a little bit before about some of the moments when you had doubts and we all have those moments what do you tell yourself to keep the faith as your you 're going through the tough times my favorite saying from randeep the Indian man it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a right it 's just not the end I say that to myself religiously I decided probably one of the challenges to when you 've got small children I remember having to actually make a phone call to the head of Macquarie HR and I was at home and I had my little two-year-old daughter and I went and I said mommy 's just got to make a little call for a minute and I shut the door and I went into the bedroom and all of a sudden she 's smashing on the door going let me and I 'm going some hiding in the corner of the Wardrobe going no no you can 't hear any noise it 's all okay I managed to get through those okay a good quote to have on the have on the wall in yeah well you 're so so you talked about well the importance of of having the right staff and a cruder has to say that but that 's that 's ok so Rowan and I do promise I ask this question of every guest speaker because finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell us other than hiring your wonderful services what is the way to pick a good employee what do you look for and where do you find them as always challenge look I think obviously a lot of people here I imagine people here you seek and you know that is a good place to go for staff unfortunately you know there 's high unemployment at the moment so you 're probably getting maybe 160 people applying or 200 people applying for every job i would suggest using industry contacts or people you trust talk to them and ask them who they might know who could be looking and perhaps going in investing some money and putting it in an industry magazine or something like that so if its particular to the insurance industry etc and finding that perfect person I don 't think there 's anything as a perfect person but I think it 's probably all about the process I don 't know if you can ask me about the process but it 's certainly something that you need to pay a lot of attention to I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for an interview so you 're making a judgment call and maybe three-quarters of an hour on someone that 's spent the last 20 30 or 40 years getting to be who they are so you 're trying to judge them in three-quarters an hour and so they 'll work for you and be a good employee and it just doesn 't happen that way so I 'm suggesting for medium or even senior roles have two meetings with them get your staff to meet them take them for lunch take them for dinner put them in a social situation and for goodness sake reference check please please reference check because I talked to so many small businesses so you think love them in the interview they 're fine well they 're not and if you can get a reference from a supervisor you know from the last couple of years you could save yourself a lot of heartache because the things that some of these referees say blow my mind and they 've given to me by the candidates oh okay so have a few interviews references what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in live in should you be checking their side definitely definitely go on linkedin see if their LinkedIn resume actually matches their real resume stalk them on facebook stalk them on Instagram and just see what they do in their spare time you know if they 're a pole dancer or whatever they 're doing not there 's anything wrong with that but you just need to my goodness I here but you just need to make sure that they are who they say they are okay so you 've gone on do to seek or wherever you found them you 've whittled them down you 've done a few interviews you check their social media so far so good okay so say you 've got them in an interview or a social setting what are you looking for in the employee is there a particular attribute like its enthusiasm number one is that the ability to to speak or the ability to write letters is a customer focus what was I I think that really depends on the role but I i believe and after 25 years of recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't change someone 's attitude that easily and if they 're bright they 'll pick up things so I think those two things that 's what I look for when I interview okay so perhaps then so attitude is more important than perhaps all the previous experiencing for definitely if someone 's bright they can pick up things but if they haven 't got the right attitude and they 're not the right person when they 're in there you know one person especially in small bizarre any business but especially in a small business one person can actually damage the morale of the rest of the team and cause a huge amount of damage while they 're there okay so now that now you 've you 've picked your favorite in person you 've got the employee there starting now how you 're now about to invest a lot of time and money and training them and all the rest of it how do you then make sure you keep the person how do you retain the good employee rather than invest that time in training only to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop them jumping to another business if they 're going to go they 're going to go I think what you can do though them to try and get them to stay as one on board them properly so make sure that you know when they arrive they actually have their business cards and actually have their login and setup and you don 't just throw them in a desk and say off you go I mean you need to care for stuff they 're a long-term you know they 're going to be a long time employee hopefully so look after them I make sure I have a chat with new staff and the first day the first week two weeks after that form of communication you know every three months every six months a formal KPI recognition every 12 months and I keep the lines of communication open all the time the best of intentions in the world it doesn 't always work right sometimes sometimes somebody who 's done really well on the recruitment process you get them in there just not a right fit is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to you should give the situation at what you should do to work out or is it better to if you 're going to separate to do it quickly well I always say do it quickly because while they 're there they 're doing damage and if you don 't do something about it I think the other employees are looking at you going why aren 't you doing something about this the people who are doing a good job looking at this person who 's playing up thinking why they still here so it actually affects them as well so I think you 're better to do it quicker rather than later on I know it 's very hard for people because no one really likes confrontation but if you 're running a business you need to be able to be confrontational in a nice way that you can just have a talk and say this is not working out you talked a little bit about growing your business and you said that part of the key to growing your business was finding somebody who could be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more than an employee now this is somebody who you 're trusting with your business your livelihood your baby that you 've that you 've bought in the lot so is there is there a particular attribute you looking for in people who you 're actually making almost your your partner and is that is that more is there a particular thing as you go about in terms of the recruitment of that kind of people identifying that kind of person is it is it is it is it important that they referred by someone in particular as a personal contact oh no I don 't think they need to be referred but I think value sets very important you have to have the same set of values and obviously they 're on the same page as you about where the business is going that 's probably very important as well okay and had and just making sure they share the same vision as well can you can you educate that into somebody or is it something that you really want to make sure that when you 're interviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't know because I think sometimes people might come on at a bit more of a junior level and you actually need to engage them in that vision so you bring them along on the journey with you and sometimes people grow into positions so they might not start off being that exact person but with your mentoring and leadership they can become that person okay and here 's one really without notice right ah you must you must have had some horror stories along you I is there a particular horas horror story that you can share with this without without dropping anybody in it but we can we can keep an eye out to avoid Oh actually that 's quite hard I haven 't had too many horror stories I can talk about one good sign yeah it is a good yeah it 's a good sign for recruiters now I can talk about one horror interview though it was actually an interview I was meant to do and the person had been referred to me and one of my consultants actually went into this interview and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after the first hour I had someone check on her after the first hour and a half I actually went in and said I 'm sorry Andrew but you needed somewhere else instill this man SAT there in this interview and every time she would go to leave he just put his hands behind his head and says I 'm not finished yet so obviously if I 'd been in there it would have lasted half an hour and he would have been out the door finally she had to leave him in the interview room and walk out and going this is done I 'm over and just leave him sitting there so we left so obviously very low on emotional intelligence and obviously someone we wouldn 't put forward for a job but I know what to do if you 're into doing you Roger that,"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"

Ltd",g3-AYdovzsI,20141211,718.62,"Brisbane City QLD 4000, Australia",2906,but mark I thought we might start of all places at the beginning you start a blue sky from scratch that was probably a pretty scary proposition at the time how did you approach it and how did you go about taking that bleep it 's very cars didn 't know because you know it 's it 's I think you 've either you either want to work for someone else or you want to work for yourself and I think in my situation what I had learned I think by the time I got to 35 I 'd sort of worked out who I was as a human being and I took a little while to work that out a lot on that journey and and so what I worked out with a couple of jobs that I had is I really liked building businesses and so I think if you 're doing work the way to be happy is actually to enjoy your work and get up in the morning and not feel like you 're heading off to a job and if you can achieve that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I thought okay well the only way I 'm going to be able to do this on steroids is to start a private equity company and and also with some late-stage venture capital because that 's where it really were the expansion capital and growth and really the jobs come from so not only do you then get to enjoy the commercial success of those businesses but you make a contribution as well I think you it 's always good to have a social conscience and the things that you 're doing admittedly our first business was a dunny business called biking rentals which you might have seen so keeping Brisbane clean and so we started the business and so and I started out it 's doing expansion capital and then and then I realized that 's we 're building the business now that the opportunities are much greater and and then and then the financial crisis came and that really for us was a tough moment we just invested a bunch of people 's money that we knew across a whole bunch of small businesses and a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights and and the crisis came and I was lucky enough to be in the US and see it coming a little bit early but it doesn 't stop the freight train and and when that freight train came we had a choice to make which was was to protect that capital and then to really fight our way through those difficult times and then had the good fortune of connecting up with with Harvard and I guess you know when you when you 're building a business and in life you get these sliding doors that come at you and you have to jump through them and I and we 've built a relationship with Harvard Business School now helping actually build up a program for Queensland and they gave us some clues on what we might be able to do with our business looking at going for which included thinking about listing on the ASX and so then we started to focus on what was the possibility of this business what could we do and and you know the financial crisis the one good thing it did for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queensland talent that was working around the world and working in London New York everywhere else of course they all came back home because there were no jobs overseas and so we started ended up being this was capturing all this talent coming in and I didn 't have jobs so I didn 't even have divisions for them work didn 't have divisions at all there were five of us and so within finding jobs for the talent to try and keep them on and then trying to find cash to do it and so it 's continued to build that after that but I don 't think it was it wasn 't scary leaping out into it what was it was probably scary for my wife I when we sold everything liquidated the house everything turned into cash to fund the business and I had a cunning plan which was to get us to the listing and we would have five thousand dollars of capital left and we had 1700 left when we listed the business and I still don 't have any money it 's all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going so I think you 've got to have a plan on the way through and that did get scary at 700 so we might come back to the growth our story but I guess still still in your early days you know the initial success was all about picking successful SMEs so you 've seen a lot of SMEs a lot of different types and you 've investigated a lot are there any particular characteristics that you look for that you think indicate a successful SME or that all the traits that they have yeah yeah absolutely and I think the difference for our business has been that we 've done it ourselves so we 're not a bunch of bankers that are coming in and saying well we think the textbook says you should do this this and this I can tell you the things that are really key to success and the first one of those is absolutely persistence like you 've got to find people that are really tough and so if you think back to to the financial crisis you don 't know where those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressions can last for a long long period of time certain recessions and and we think this crisis is still ongoing a long way to go and I think people generally have about an 18-month window where they 'll guts it out if they get to the end of 18 months and they haven 't solved for the problems that they 've got Julian then mostly they find a reason to leave I don 't like the work environment here or you 're not paying me enough and someone else is offering me a better job you 've got to find people that you own it back they 're going to stick and have the conviction to stay with their business through the times that inevitably are difficult we have not yet seen any investment yet that hasn 't at some stage really sucked it 's been really tough where you 're looking at it you 've got no cash coming in sales aren 't coming people are suffering you 've got to find those people and I think the other things are relatively simple is that you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone so so a lot of people have great ideas but there 's actually no commercial no commercial implication for those businesses yet so we 're looking now in out of Brisbane and a lot of them are Britain based at about a thousand deals a year so I don 't think there 's a lack of ideas about there but there is an enormous gap between someone 's idea and a commercial application for that opportunity so finding people to understand how to get to that point I think is really interesting and the nice thing that we 're seeing we 've seen since the RBA dropped interest rates so low we 're seeing that people are much more willing to invest from their super other things into angel deals I think if you 're starting a business you should be able to get half moon or a million bucks together from people that you know and by pitching a great idea it 's the next level that comes in that 's more difficult so you mentioned then that some of course every business has its challenges go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still happening and it 's still happening your yours was the GFC how do you how do you have you approach size challenges how would you recommend other business people approach their challenges there any tips and tricks or yeah there are some tips and tricks I mean I 'll tell you the things that work for me so we built a vision for our business and everyone talks about their vision their mission everything else we keep these things really really simple so what I do is I this is the Chinese person in me coming out so 5-year plans and I don 't move the five-year plan so you know people do business plans and they continue to roll them and update it 's a living document and all that stuff and that 's that 's that doesn 't work I don 't think you got it you 've got to have a plan and you 've got to know exactly where you 're going and so our plan was that we were going to be listed at the end of five years of existence to be listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country at that time and so to be listed we had to be credible we had to be good of what we did we had to have raised money we had to have deployed money well we had to have made good investments and we had to have a great team and a good story because we had a name which is blue sky which is you know financial people hate real people love but but financial people hate so it there are so many things we had to solve for but by having the one goal of being listed what that meant was that we we had to solve for all other things and and then what I did is we we 're breaking in a six-month bite-size chunks because if you go for a year it 's too long you know you find yourself pushing into that last part of the year where you haven 't achieved all the things you want to achieve so we break the year into hearts and quarters too short so there 's six months bite-sized chunks I know everything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to the five-year plan the next five-year plan for us was really simply and that 's why I love the document that was running the document today with 2031 it 's got three things you want to do which we love to say so if you look at us it 's 2 billion under management which means always 20-minute wente percent internal rates of return which is our investment returns for our investors and that will lead to a net profit after tax of 20 million all those things flow from each other and how we get there will be different and I cannot dictate that I can 't have spreadsheets that tell me how to get there now so having that conviction that we 're all going to get there through the financial crisis and I 'll tell you there was only one solution surround yourself I said I got really lucky I had him I got Tim Wilson who joined our business I 've gone to uni with him University of Queensland mostly played rugby indirectly and to be quite frank with here and then he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy in London but came back with came up with all the issues that had happened in in London and when he came back he was a guy that had guts and determination he was he was nocturnal and I get up early because I 'm from a farming background so literally I would be coming in to work at new farm on our dodgy little office high-fiving Tim as he goes out the door at 3 in the morning I was coming in at 30 we 'd do a crossover and then he 'd come back in at 9 and I 'd be going home at about 30 7 o 'clock to try and get some food six five or six hours sleep and back to work and we did that for three days and we didn 't know what I was going to hit and we both look a hell of a lot older now we did then if you have a look at it have a look and I reckon graph seen a bit of this but if there 's some pictures of us we started out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I 'm really suffering so I think I think you have to you 've got it you 've got to have a work ethic but but then around that you 've got to get the family support and where I was really fortunate and I 've got to say it was really tough with my wife and the kids it was really tough during that whole time because you don 't know when it 's going to end and once again you get that 18-month piece of string and it dries out and your wife does get to the point there 's I 've had enough of this so I think the family support that and they committed to your goal is critical if you don 't have that then eventually eventually you will get dragged back into doing something else so so you 've mentioned how you have during the GFC that gave you an opportunity to grab some great stuff when you just talk now about how you had that pivotal partner next to you the whole way we all know how important for any good staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to find good people as the old adage goes so when you 're when you 're picking staff and you 're looking for people we 're going to stick with your business improve your business what kind of attributes are you looking in people and then where you 're biting them yeah this is I 've got some businesses before this is a different business because we 're looking after other people 's money and we know a lot of them so this is a business where I can 't afford to have anybody gets not a complete a greater and I think about 60 staff now we 've probably got 30 that are there maybe another 10 or 20 that that I closed at 10 we won 't make it and so what we do you know what we 've done historically we 've made some mistakes we 've mostly hired people that are referred to us by people that we know that 's been much more successful networks matter it just works and you need people that are going to stick the second thing the second thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a process it 's a bit scary for people that joined so they usually go through a process our CIO and other people that are hiring them and then they have to have the conversation with me and so I take them down to Stella rasa for a coffee and for an hour and a half you can see they 're absolutely horrified and basically I 'm telling them how hard it 's going to be when they come into our business and I 'm essentially talking them out of taking the job and because of the success we 've had I said you don 't want to take your CV out into the marketplace and people know that you 've failed here because everybody else has succeeded here is incredibly well regarded and it 's really interesting on about two-thirds of them bail after my coffee and and I think they 're the people that are that are trying to build a CV in particular and build a profile for themselves but don 't really have the substance and character to deliver and and so the mistakes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that process where you and you can do that in different ways and different businesses now that we started that that real hard to heart there 's a price for you for failure here a genuine price if they call you if you if someone calls me and wants a reference I 'm going to tell them that you 're crap you know that 's it 's a really scary conversation and you 'll stop hiring people that are really present well particularly marketing people who always present well then then I think that 's a that that 's an easy way to solve for it,"(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"

Brisbane I 'll be talking to you about the Brisbane digital strategy this is a five-year strategy I should add that not only am I the second chief to cluster appointed by city in the world but even more impressive this is the first digital strategy for a city with a focus primarily on economic development so basically it 's all about growing the economy in brisbane by encouraging more companies to increase their uptake of digital technology now by more companies that predominantly means SMEs because SME is account for a hundred billion of brisbane 135 billion dollar economy I 120,000 SMEs and Brisbane and what we want to do is to close that gap between as Julian refer to the eighty percent of companies who claim to be engaged in the digital economy and the thirty percent that actually are we need to really kind of close that gap so basically in the SME area our objective our aim is to double the number of Brisbane businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of initiatives SMEs who are kind of at the start of their journey who basically digital novices will primarily be concerned with developing a good digital marketing strategy initially to get themselves known and get their brand recognized online a more advanced intermediate level the SMEs who will already have you know a fairly good online presence so we looking at kind of getting a bit more adventurous getting into things like mobile apps and that type of thing well what will help them to do is to develop an effective digital business strategy which will incorporate ecommerce and get them actually selling online directly through their websites as companies grow and get larger to take on a certain form which includes a kind of a departmental structure etc the employees will grow it revenues will grow so those companies were at the more advanced stage of their development will help them to put in place a suitable digital transformation strategy to create across all areas of their business we ourselves in in the city of Brisbane and Brisbane City Council we 're concerned with basically developing a digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as effectively something that is a an umbrella around all of those previous activities and all of those previous types of strategies that all the companies in Brisbane can kind of come together under one strategy and contribute to developing the economy of Brisbane using digital technology we also want to encourage the development of digital startups in Brisbane is great potential here but they certainly need for assistance financial assistance and support for for startups so we can kind of grow the digital startup community the company that three guys on the wall are part of a company Cole we are we are hundred who basically were acquired by Twitter recently they developed a kind of a music engine which would enable you to kind of prioritize you know or send music to people based on their preferences so this ended up being acquired by twitter has now been integrated into twitter as part of the twitter music service so these guys moved to the US and we 're all very proud of them but it would be lovely if companies like this you know could stay here so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the startup strategy is to provide would be startups and budding entrepreneurs with opportunities as we do in the visiting entrepreneurs program and also the budding entrepreneurs program and one brief story is that added events similar to this a few months ago I met a woman she came up to me after the event and she said that she had an idea for a business could I give her any advice so I said well you know why don 't you apply for the budding entrepreneurs program that we run through the Brisbane digital strategy so she did and she was successful she got a small amount of funding to help her with her aspirations towards setting up a company and the last I heard of her was on the radio I think the Steve Austin radio recently telling him all about our company so that 's pretty fast and that was I hope as certainly a direct result of the help she got through the strategy we certainly were able to help her so basically with the startups we want to increase the number create 250 new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global potential like the guys are in the picture here the cyber city program is where we want to aim to improve public online services for residents and Brisbane also visitors coming to Brisbane to improve the type of experience that they have while they 're here to make sure they have a great experience at the destination what you see in the picture here is one of the initiatives under this program which is the coder dojo initiative which is where kids from 7 to 17 come into the library a number of libraries around Brisbane every Saturday and with the help of experienced mentors from the ICT in digital sectors who give their time for free they get encouraged to develop their coding skills and these are these are all kids with a certain natural affinity based on you know using computers and tablets and devices at home so we encourage them to come together and try to kind of collectively put some kind of shape behind this and give them a sense that you know there is a future in this type of coding activity for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do if you are looking for information about where to go for your to develop your digital presence online is to go first of all to digital Brisbane calm delay you which is the website which has been specifically developed and launched in support of the SME community in in Brisbane here you 'll find in a nice kind of user friendly style access to lots of different supporting information regardless of whether you 're new to this so you 're kind of you know you 've got a mature online presence or you 're integrating your digital and business strategies whatever stage of the process you 're at you 'll find support in here and one means rather a lot of this then manifests itself in offline support and activities the goals of the site are to inspire and encourage local small and medium businesses to engage in the digital economy to learn about the latest digital news stories blogs events and suppliers in Brisbane and to provide business tools in order to increase productivity efficiency it 's based on eight key elements or components that we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take from starting as I said at the kind of business planning stage building a website technology digital marketing buying and selling skills and training and driving competence and basically going right through this entire chain are all represented on the website and as you go through the website you see this model kind of constantly refer to a lot of related content as you as say search for blogs read blogs it 'll it 'll also direct you to related content in the areas of the blog 's that you decide you 're interested in the case studies as a number as a said cart on the red bar on the left corresponding to the eight areas key areas we identified you can find case studies from real life customer companies around Brisbane including the digital champions that were selected as a result of the digital audit which Julian mentioned earlier and in fact I mean those those digital champions I mean they 're there they 're thriving I mean there are fantastically inspiration and I think one of them ground pro will be talking to us later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very active kind of events area we are about to launch a series of events the digital 101 events so the first of these is on Wednesday of this week in Hamilton it 's actually sold out i believe i think over a hundred people going to that so it draw your attention to one that 's coming up on the 21st in november which is in milton which i think you can still apply to go for to register for if you 're interested so i would direct you to the website digital Brisbane calm that are you to get information on that we have a digital directory here you can go in and again using either the eight components i mentioned earlier or free text search you can match yourself against digital suppliers who have basically submitted their details for inclusion on the website and those details are included submitted to us and we basically kind of go through them and then register them on the website so you know that 's a process therefore for matchmaking so this this size was launched quite recently only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiles and visits and of those I think about 20,000 or 600 people have undertaken searches on this directory so it 's proving to be quite valuable and a few months ago we we actually the real life matchmaking event where we got about 50 SMEs and 50 suppliers together in the same room and so as I said a lot of what you see on the website will be kind of replicated in offline events free Wi-Fi map here shows we 're up to about 250 i think if not more at the stage outlets where you can get free Wi-Fi around brisbane or concentrated in the kind of mainly in the kind of CBD and outlying areas if you need more information about all of this then the website as i said is digital brisbane comdata you you can access us via Facebook etc Twitter as well if you wish to do that way and I just as a last slide here encourage you if you want to kind of be very real time and very digital you

guys listeners for those who haven 't heard of reload medium and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room could you give us a little bit of a rundown of what it is that you do sure and what we are is a new breed of digital company we 're not web designers so we don 't build websites what we do is when you finish building a website we actually drive traffic to it so we put you on google and we get you high up on google with google being ninety percent of searches in australia starting on google that 's the one we focus on so we do everything after you build a website so Louie at the digital area the digital space can be a little bit fraught some people swear by and say it 's the future others are not so sure so if I 'm a small to medium business at what point do I need a digital strategy at what point do I need to be on Facebook Twitter and the life I think everybody needs one these days things are moving so quickly the Lord Mayor touched on that as well it 's like a locomotive coming and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be struggling the big one we 've got at the moment with that is mobile and everybody needs to have a mobile strategy because the way that we 're seeing the statistics roll is that it 's increasing by fifteen to twenty percent year-on-year that people are moving away from their PCs and desktops into mobile devices an application and even though I 'm the young business Person of the Year for last year I 'm still pretty old compared to some of my Gen Y staff and most of those guys I don 't have a telephone at home on a landline like I still got my telstra line on my copper and b they don 't use a pc they just use a mobile phone or a tablet so what 's happening is this whole generation is shifting and it 's going to be next couple of years that mobile is actually going to replace desktop for searches on google ok so before but with a little bit just to step back a little before we get into one new things like the mobile I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody starts how can how can they best optimize their you know driving traffic to their website how do we get it to the top of Google and things like that the number one thing to think about these days is content and content is king people go to Google again i 'll talk about google because they have a question and google 's there to give them an answer so where do i find a solicitor in sunnybank or where do i find a podiatrist in brisbane you 're always going to type those words in so the best thing you can do on your website is have lots of content about your particular industry vertical so if you 're a small business person here in sunnybank you want to really talk about and do a blog on your website and have articles on there which talk about you being the authority of source about your particular industry vertical and that 's the number one thing because what happens then is your website will get shared people will tweet about it they 'll Facebook what they liked the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a popular website so content is king so you 're looking for unique content regularly updated content for your website so in terms of Facebook and Twitter then how important to those I mean a are people actually out there looking for businesses on facebook where they just chatting to their to their friends or watching what their 14 or 17 year old daughter or son is doing yet it 's it 's it 's a very interesting one business is jumping aboard Facebook in record numbers it still is a social media tool about 12 million Australians are on Facebook it has about nine minutes a day we each spend on Facebook and if we consider to be our leisure time so if you 're going to be on facebook which i recommend you do is even a small business the two things to remember our don 't spam people don 't keep adding things that people are going to annoyed about and just remember that it 's all about lightweight interactions over a period of time so just do little things that are about your business like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find followers start to like your page and they want to know about what the latest flavor of the cupcake are your bakery is don 't try and sell them the economic blueprint for Brisbane just talked about the cupcakes good because they 're there to see that and I think that 's the key ok so one what one of the things that often gets raised at these sorts of forums is that small businesses is tough there 's limited resources in terms of a digital strategy and our digital communications how much resources should a should have small to medium business be putting towards it in terms of staff and and money well be coming from the Digital side I think it 's very important and I think part of your business planning needs to be digitally focused because the economy is moving in a digital way everything needs to go into making sure you 're updating your website you 're updating your Facebook page your Google+ page some of you might not want to be on Twitter and you don 't need to be so there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and discount those straight away but the ones you do like the website and the blogs and keeping those up to date now if you physically can 't do them yourselves a good tip that we 've done in the past has got either an intern on board or a uni student on board for a few hours a week up say 20 bucks an hour pay them you know the minimum wage to come in and do some blogging for you some updates and things like that and we 've recruited through uq Griffith and QUT over period of number of years many different young guys who are keen to update the digital strategy of the smallest business because what they 're doing their second or third year at uni or teh for wherever might be they can actually start to get some career experience so it works both ways so we 've all heard the um you know the good stories where the picture of the cupcakes gone viral and reached a million people but um gee there 's some horror stories as well when you talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company make sure that if they 've got a digital presence what 's said about them on that digital presence is positive and not negative it 's it 's very important to have a we call it a war room strategy so it 's basically the same as PR reputation management and even a small business on Facebook you 're actually putting yourself out there to the world so you going to make sure that you actually have at the back your mind if someone does make a negative comment how are you going to deal with that comment how you 're going to you 're going to delete it off there which we don 't recommend or you 're going to take it offline and have a chat like you would if they came into the shop so just treat social media just like bricks and mortar shopping in a retail environment and make sure that you always get back to people you always make sure that you respond to them and you 're honest and open and and you 're there because what people are then doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or post that has been made and they 're actually going to value you better if you actually respond in a more positive way even if it 's a negative incident we 've had a number of clients multinationals and small businesses here in Brisbane also overseas that we 've had about 20 people at one time working on one particular post that one person made to 500,000 people on that facebook page so we often have to do it the same principles with that in a small business ok so but importantly make sure you 've all game de dum beforehand before you get on to it now I 'm um I 'm conscious that I 'm about to ask you something a little bit of advice for everyone which is something you probably are usually charge for but in terms of what we 've got everyone here and we 've got your insight what would be your top top three do 's and don 'ts for a digital communication strategy well I think the number one one these days to work out is to have a mobile strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said very important in what you do you don 't need to go and build an app and because people charge a lot of money to build an iPhone or an Android app just make your website mobile-friendly that means it works on a mobile device which is called responsive design the second one is social media jump on board Google+ Google Plus is Google 's own social media tool and there 's about 400 million people on that facebook app about 1.2 billion worldwide on on facebook but Google+ actually helps your rankings in Google rise so if you can actually hook up Google Plus to your blog into your website you 're going to get a bit of a jump on your competitors the third one I recommend that everybody is empowered within your business I think everybody needs to be digitally focused and everybody needs to have digital at the forefront of what they do and they need to respond in a 24-7 way they need to make sure that the lead that comes in treated as actually the new sales leader the bricks and mortar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy is going and the people that are jumping on that and getting their staff to respond and they 're responding very quickly are actually going to get ahead excellent and what about the top the top diets what have you seen go terribly wrong well the number one would definitely be social media not having a plan not understanding you know market the market and what they 're saying we call a negative sentiment not getting negative sentiment right not responding back so yeah don 't whatever you do if you don 't have a plan to do social media or especially facebook I 'd actually say don 't get on there get on there once you 've got a plan and that 's probably going to be the biggest one","(-27.4704528, 153.0260341)"

making change for a brighter [Applause] [Music] future [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] um [Music] [Applause] [Music] one of the first events was an exploration of the great outdoors on a bus tour where young people visited three of the region 's natural areas to learn about native plants and animals [Music] so today we 're undertaking a bus tour with a group of youth as part of the green book program so we 've got 25 young people we 're taking them around a number of our nature reserves to show them how beautiful the environment is in the bundaberg region we came out to some of bundaberg 's natural areas learning about lots of the different species of plants and that that are found in the areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yeah just out having a good time going on a bit of an adventure and so i went to meadowvale and i just learned so many new things and i noticed and learnt about that different trees grew in different soils and i went to sharon gorge nature park and i saw the really amazing rocks because like the rock faces and you could see the different layers in the rocks and i went to boardroom swamp i picked some seeds off the trees and put them in some bags to plant in the yards so we could grow our own trees we had guides and they took this through it talked about you know the different plans and kind of how the terrain changed and i found that really interesting and it was just like beautiful landscapes and again it was fun being with other young people and just learning about these things you know the natural environment as humans we kind of have a responsibility to look after it the way it looks after us so engaging in programs like this is a good way to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting the environment looking after it the way it looks after us yeah going to those nature reserves that are so nearby but i hadn 't been to before and it was they were really nice little walks and it was very pleasant so you know it just kind of shows you want to protect those things a second bus trip took the budding environmentalists to more of bundaberg 's diverse natural areas so we 're out here exploring some of the more natural areas on the second bus trip so we went down to archie 's beach today at bagara looking for marine plastics and stuff like that we then went to berlin nature reserve a lot of history down there and it 's a really nice walk and then we came here to the hammock and went to check out the lookout and learn a bit more about the wangara scrub which covered most of the bundaberg a lot of blunderberg area back in the settlement times the first one was really good i learned a lot from the three parks we went to last time i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i thought it was more i could learn and i definitely did i learned more about what we have in bundaberg the different organizations that are in place i hadn 't known about was very interesting i think it 's important for younger people to get involved uh eventually that the younger people now are going to be the adults in a few years time and it 's important that we 're looking after the environment and i think it 's really important that we can teach people to look after it without the environment we wouldn 't be here so everyone 's going to have an impact on the environment whether they know it or not taking part in things like this has taught me how everyone 's actions are going to impact on the environment a visit from green book to isis district state school taught the agriculture students about composting and fertilizing the green book project has come out today just to show us agriculture class just to show what fertilizing is composting 's like all fertilization for plants which helps like the roots and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have here and just all and all the composting we 're doing yeah this composting project would go pretty well i just love agricultural in every way because um i 've grown up with agriculture and it 's just it 's just really fun to do just learn just how the environment goes and how soil goes and and just learn how to like provide for the community we 're doing all of it like fertilizing planting and we got cattle and goats and just learning how do the roots fertilize to help the seedling grow like grow out of the seed and all that eight schools from across the district planted 300 trees on their grounds as a part of greenbrook during these planting sessions older children were partnered up with younger students to help explain the importance of trees in the environment i was involved because i 'm in the year 6 class and i want to be a good role model for younger students and for them to care of the environment around us with their next generation they 'll be able to tell people what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's quite good to be involved because i 'm taking part in nature 's place well one of the benefits is definitely with the environment since as the years go by and people grow our atmosphere and litter increases dangerously and by planting trees it really helps and also the mindset as well you get a get to relax from this crazy world that we live in the green book planting sessions taught the young people about animal habitats and the impact of clearing vegetation on wildlife it 's what gives us life it 's it 's the lifestyle so everything without trees without nature we we wouldn 't be here today the dam got dug out not that long ago and um which meant trees and stuff got knocked down and um because of that a lot of wildlife went we thought we 'd plant some trees in here and thank you for them for donating the trees because it 'll bring back a lot of wildlife just very devastating not having the wildlife here but it 'd be really good to get them back because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals and i like for all the animals to have homes and that we have clean air well it 's just giving back to the environment really because if we don 't treat it right it 's just going to disappear and it 'll be nothing just life in general it makes it a lot healthier and helps with students as well seeing the that their school is like nice and clean also like it with what abby was saying it 's making the environment more cleaner so the atmosphere especially with like planting more trees they 're able to provide more for us as well as us being able to provide for them so giving them their space the nutrients they need to grow so i think that 's really good that kids are getting more involved to be able to do that the trees planted for the green book project are contributing to the one million trees initiative by bundaberg regional council it feels really good because you feel like you 're doing something really big and that especially since it 's like one million trees and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empowering it 's really good to be able to know that we 're helping and we 're not just standing around doing nothing and just ignoring the problem that is quite current so i do agree it 's very empowering it means that planting one million trees we can help the environment and the trees and help all the animals so that they have shelter and places to live like their habitat i love that in some places it can 't be touched and that the environment can just go on with how it was living before us humans came i love that it 's been here before us and we want it to be here after us i really like it because it 's helped me a lot personally through life and stressful events and it 's somewhere i can go and ground myself well i decided to help with the environmental team because i think it 's really important that we maintain our environment especially since there 's like a lot of pollution and stuff going on so it 's good to make sure that we 're contributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by just like planting trees here today really it 's just like one small step but it helps in the big picture it also makes you feel like a lot better to be able to help and to have that opportunity to do so events ranged from local beach cleanups to learning about eco-friendly beeswax wrap plastic alternatives and even creating a bee hotel in your [Music] backyard [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] as well as cleaning the air the trees will one day be big enough to provide homes for australian wildlife until then the green book participants took a workshop to make boxes and give possums a safe place to sleep and hide well we 're um in burnet heads at one of our experienced possum carers homes and we 're here to actually um see the installation of one of the possum boxes that the ymca youth group made in conjunction with the council 's green book project and see one of the little possums actually being in put in the box so when a tiny possum comes in it will actually stay in a in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months old and then once it 's that age it 'll be put out into a possum box so it can basically learn to be a possum and start to become independent and it will actually do a soft release from that possum box his mother was was found dead and he was still alive in the pouch so a kind member of the public rescued him and took him to one of our local vets and he was picked up from there and is now being cared for by this particular carer well you know more and more these days people are cutting down trees and land clearing and all that sort of thing and the animals are losing habitat so for instance possums gliders flying foxes all sorts of animals and birds that use trees are losing their habitats so it 's important to create an artificial habitat for them well it means that they can have protection from the weather and also from predators such as carpet pythons and things like that and somewhere nice and warm to sleep in the during the day in the cooler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their young as well [Music] the young people had a first-hand experience learning about native plants and their uses during a bush tucker garden tour with ray johnson at jinjin landcare it was also a unique opportunity to learn about indigenous symbols and their meanings with farron munroe a member of the jinjinboro aboriginal corporation today i 'm putting on designs of symbols that aboriginal people use on the and and and painted on their artifacts when they 're looking at their particular art they can probably distinguish where they 've come from and what particular area they focus on the animals that are in the area and the the environment that they 're in yeah we have a bush tucker garden to um to demonstrate the sort of plants that were once commonly eaten by aboriginal people a lot of these are not so familiar to people now but they 're here as a sample specimens that people can look at and know that these are the things that people used to eat commonly so i learned what type of bush chocolate there is and and species of bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have learned about the different symbols that they had there and about different types of paintings that they did the styles and probably the colors too so yeah that 's what we learned today in the boomerangs you strap boomerang painting it 's a real challenge i 've always been interested in aboriginal culture especially the bush tucker area i suppose um because we 've got where we live there 's quite a few little berries and stone fruits that you 'll find on trees and i don 't know what they are plus it would be it 's important to know i think more about your country and everything and its history and all that i learned a lot about what they mean and how about how when you 're painting on the boomerang how each everything you painted meant something it was all very it was important and how it 's not just an object it means something to where you are and who you are it 's important for you to know these things because you can tell other people about it and then they can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never known about so i guess we can apply it in the future and you know maybe one day use it i suppose if you want to like grow stuff or start your own business or something like that um if we don 't have an environment we practically don 't have a life because the environment um it well that 's where all our food our water our air trees breathe in what we breathe out we breathe in what trees breathe out so that 's why people say talking to plants is good for them it 's not actually the talking it 's actually the air coming out of you the 10 oxygen that comes out and all the other things i think it 's important because it means so much and has so much history with the aboriginals and with everybody who lives in australia and it would be such a waste if we just let it disappear over 8 months 370 young people from around the bundaberg region participated in the green book project through innovative workshops hands-on learning experiences and speaking with industry professionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason that it 's important to spend time in nhl is because then you learn how important it is and why we need to save it because if we just carry on what we 're doing eventually all the wildlife is going to be destroyed and there 'll be no more left then we will have an opportunity to share with others the wonders of nature i guess and to always um look around and see how beautiful everything is without pollution and stuff like that i got involved because i just wanted to do it and it was really fun and it was a great experience for me like a real good experience for me because i feel much better and much more confident and i 'm more reason to do why i do what i do it was really nice to see that we were doing something in bundaberg to you know promote that kind of thing and i didn 't think we would be doing that kind of thing and it was really like uplifting to see stuff being done um about it to educate people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to be doing stuff and like knowing that you know i 'm doing good by trying to do the right thing it 's also a bit sad to think that we need to do this still it 's it 's bittersweet and i hope that more people do realize that things are happening now as well as later and there isn 't time to wait [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] uh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

Central QLD 4670, Australia",26317,so welcome to the people here and also online we 've got quite a few people who are joining us online which is fantastic and uh we 've had some great feedback from them as well just a reminder to put your phones on silent please but you can keep your slido poll open and just a reminder too if you 're doing any posts we 'd love you to do some posts about the conference we really want to get the word out about the great things that are happening in the bioeconomy space use that hashtag bundybio21 so the hashtag for the conference to use in any social media posts as bundy bio21 like to i say a big thank you to all those who have made the conference possible and we 'd like to acknowledge the event partners bundaberg regional council fraser coast regional council gimpy regional council and the bundaberg department of state development infrastructure local government and planning their partnership has been integral in making this event happen we 'd also like to thank the speakers and local industry who have allowed us to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've got a couple more today you taking the time to commit to this event has allowed it to go ahead along with the showcasing of our wonderful region so we can we please thank all those people very much now yesterday of course was the melbourne cup and uh everyone got into the spirit of it and uh took a uh ticket from our sweep one of the winners actually wasn 't here yesterday when we gave out the prizes but they are today david mcdermott can you come up and get your prize please he 's right up the back of the room so uh we 're going to totally embarrass him david has won an amazing pack of some wonderful local products from the bundy region from cha cha chocolate an amazing local store so well done would you like the bag you can even have the bag there you go thank you david no second sorry [Laughter] only first in this sweep but it didn 't cost you anything so that was something clive okay well let 's get started on our wonderful guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for today is ray mountford managing director of leaf resources ray developed the ideas to sustainably manufacture turpentine and rosen is that he pronounced rosin after working for a new zealand-based company eco echo chemicals now lauters that extracts rosin and terpenes is that what you say from the byproducts of the craft pulping process see i 've learned some stuff already noticing the demand for renewable pine chemicals increasing in everyday products and the shortage of supply ray identified an opportunity to improve the manufacturing process to produce higher volumes in a cleaner and more environmentally friendly way with no foreign residues in the end product in july 2016 ray and his family moved to gimpy his company of central queensland commissioned australia 's first natural pine chemical extraction plant in bundaberg which we 're very excited about leaf resources has a strong esg focus the trees are sourced from fsc certified forests which means for every tree used another is planted they have also developed a technology to extract pine chemicals from previously unutilized stumps which further encourages reforestation as the first pine chemical manufacturer in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the australian sustainable bioeconomy from ideas to action please welcome ray mountford there we go good morning fragrances paint sticky tape ink and food products petrochemicals have traditionally been used in all of these products however as the world shifts from a fossil-based economy to a sustainable bio economy leaf resources innovative technology is embracing the power of fsc certified forests turning forestry waste into sustainable pine chemicals leaf resources produce two products one terpenes used for flavorings and fragrances and two rosin used for adhesives like heavy duty paint and sticky tapes the terpenes and rosin can be extracted from any type of pine using leaf resources patented organic solvent extraction technology we begin our process by sizing the logs or stumps then we put them through our chipping machine the wood is then screened and transferred to a continuous extractor the resin is washed from the wood using the essential oil of the pine tree is the solvent the extractor removes both the terpenes and the resin as a liquid and this is transferred to the distillation section for separation into our final products the separation process distills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one line and turned into a liquid and the second line is turned to a harder liquid known as rosin the terpenes are condensed into bulk storage to be shipped the rosin is packaged into drums or bags and cooled ready for selling no added chemicals no contamination and with the leftovers the water goes into irrigation the wood into wood pellets as an alternative to coal leaf resources patented organic solvent extraction technology is a truly circular sustainable and scalable solution join us creating a fossil free future all right good morning again that would be easier for me uh yeah i just really want to talk about the journey of um taking an idea through and executing it um to you know to completion um which is again a sustainable business and i think you know some of the things we 've there 's lots of ideas everyone 's got great ideas um the the difficulty that we have and the difficulty that we have here in australia in particular is converting those how do we get funds how do we how do we plan to get funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a team you know how do we how do we be successful um in in an environment that 's probably the heavily most heavily regulated uh environment to start a new business and particularly manufacturing in the world and and i think uh you know notwithstanding that we can do it but we have to address those issues we have to plan for those issues and we have to cost those issues into our into our projects and uh you know how do you take when you start a business from third world because that 's where you 're starting to start from scratch to first world and you 're expected to do that by government and all those regulations all those rules in the first month those are the challenges that we face if we want to be real about executing and delivering you know this bioeconomy um new manufacturing and solutions to the problems that we 're all facing so um i 'll just start by telling you how it started a little bit about myself yeah i 'm a expert at kiwi been in australia six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family calls australia home two of my daughters are married australian boys from gympie lovely chaps one 's a farmer ginger farmer the other is a uh glazier i 've got an australian grandchild of course now um and uh and i love australia and i love the fact that this is a land that 's big with big horizons and it thinks big and i think you know when i look around this room and the people that i 've met you know many of us have come here to the lucky country and uh and we 're able to make it the lucky country and and i want to embrace that and i want to talk about how we can continue with that concept today um you know i was uh my background i 'm not i 'm not a uh you know i 'm not a well-trained person in the terms of university and that i have a diploma in dairy technology um i grew up in a company now called fonterra in new zealand um we did some projects back in 2000 but prior to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my training there my hr guy that employed me said you know young fellas you 're coming here you take the because they put us through university but you take the training and then you bugger off overseas and do yoe and you know as soon as the training is done he says what i want from you ray cause when you 've done that you come back here and make some money for us and that because you know young people do need to grow up so here 's a man with vision and uh simon so and that 's what happened actually i didn 't go overseas i started my own business i started a little curbing business i came to australia for the first time i went overseas came to brisbane bought a kirby machine took it back to new zealand and started a little business called kiwi curb um that was in 1987 that business is the biggest business of its type still today in tarangabo plenty new zealand they do roading as well as some home garden edging and that now as well some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my way to work i got hit by a logging truck and such other turns of life and rolled six times um busted my back busting my knee and so i sold that business and i went back to the dairy company and asked for simon the company there was 500 strong one percent of new zealand 's gdp went through that particular factory and you know if ontario you might know this dairy is very big in new zealand and um and so uh asked for simon said here i am i 'll deliver on that promise and so he took me on the next day and uh it was 18 months after that that we won the world manufacturing title for um no downtime for an entire season 35 million on the bottom line and what we did was i just measured what was going down the river and this wasn 't 1990s and before you know before a lot of these words that we throw around and just sustainability and that and was sort of fashionable and uh four percent of the product from that factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick a solids meter on it and pick up the amount of protein and that cost about 150 bucks and that 350 grand implement 35 million impact um that established some credentials for how we move forward you know for what would then happen in my life as i you know when i left there i took a job at a pine chemicals company they call we just mentioned early echo chemicals mount mongone and um you know the the first day on their job coming from family background is that we have a joint venture forest with uh hancock 's which is the people that own the forest pine forest that you see between here in brisbane it 's uh it 's only a small forest but but you know we have a strong background in pine chemical and in forestry and i didn 't know about the pine chemicals but on the first day on that job and they were saying we can 't get supply and i 'm thinking hang on we 've got one and a half million hectares of pine down here in new zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are in those trees through our gates and uh that that just for me sparked a journey a 20-year journey till today that has uh um become my passion become the driving thing that i like the reason i get out of bed um and uh because as i started to understand the industry as it said there you know these are natural they 're existing and at the moment they 're rotting in the ground so what a hell of an opportunity if you can access it and uh but you know the dumb thing was at the time i started at the top of the tree i had to learn the animal i had to learn the industry and that 's i started looking for pine chemicals on the tips of the leaves not in the stumps where they all reside but anyway so that 's uh the the other thing that impacted me was growing up where i grew up i mentioned the pine industry we have pulping chemical pulping and it 's called sustainable manufacture and i want to ask us today whether we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're calling sustainability because the trees that get planted and then harvested then replanted yes that 's sustainable but if your process and how you utilize those is is has negative or is a destructive process that doesn 't make it sustainable by riding on the back of your supply chain and and i think that you know as businesses we need to look down the supply chain but we need to also look at ourselves and how we 're designing our business some of the countries or you know certainly queensland 's best scientists best people in this room and and in the room yesterday but we you know we don 't want to hide behind something else and and that was that was what i uh saw there was that the pulp mills because they 're big they make a lot of money they employ a lot of people they employ generally speaking the whole town so nobody wants to talk about the elephant in a room do they so i was surfing i 'm a keen surfer i was surfing as a 18 19 year old when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught i had taken a sickie um but i caught the bloody traffic lights by my boss but um but the thing was was that um that 's why i got that photo up there that 's actually double on point that 's my son taking off but um i got caught uh surfing but the thing was was that um i was 35 kilometers from the outlet from a river mouth just like we have a river about the size of what we 've got down here the burnett and uh i was the stench of uh chemicals sulfides sulfates mercaptans um was all over me and when i got home my brother from from nearly from the distance at collier 's to me now what 's with you you know and and that that had such an impact on me because my mum used to always talk about how matata the little village where i grew up nearest i was on a farm of course but that they had the highest rate of cancer in the country and now my first chairman of my first mentor when i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulp and paper mill and that but he died at the age of 54 cancer so those things that had a huge impact on my life in particular and then peter passing and you know there was another chat bill he was the general manager of the tissue factory toilet paper he died at 55 statistically or whatever i 've got four years left or three years left you know it 's that 's um that 's the chemicals industry for you and that so we going to be destructive or non-destructive and how we approach this are we going to be sustainable or are we going to hide behind that word how do you take a concept conceived pretty much in the surf and turn it into a reality how do you take a good idea conceived in a workshop and turn it into a reality um particularly when in first world just on compliance alone you 're going to spend on any small manufacturing plant you 're going to spend compared to doing it in let 's say our biggest competitor china you 're going to spend at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on compliance issues whether that be engineers that design whether that be uh electrical compliance from australia where you have four four different lots of sign-offs versus one in somewhere like new zealand or the states you know where you 've got a bureaucratic layers that you 've got to wade through the these if we don 't consider these things if we don 't plan for these things the other things they don 't trip us up and we 're going to fail and you know i 've got some some of the things that we need to work through up there on the up there on the wall and you can we 'll go through those but you know one i 'll just go through them quickly defining your values and your focus you know what uh who are we what are we trying to achieve for me it was all about i 'm not gonna design i 'm not gonna put my ass out there for a business that 's uh that 's destructive you know i 've got to believe in what i 'm doing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know your key business drivers you know profit guys as the driver it 's not sustainable if you can 't if you can 't pay the bills so how do we get there you know so many people got an idea and they say well if the government does this then we 'll be able to make it work that 's a cop-out you 're trying to pass the buck you 're trying to abdicate your responsibility your responsibility as as a business or as an idea promoter is to make it happen within the within the confines on the playground that the government gives us we can we can push we can agitate you can do all that and i 'm a good agitator but at the end of the day we it 's up to us if you don 't own it don 't get out of bed with it just go get a job and that i think that 's really important you know key business driver for our business is raw materials but you might be in the transport logistics chain you might be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to identify where you are and focus on that because as we go along everyone that you you meet they come along they say oh but what about this what about that 's particularly if you get some funding you know it 's called project fever everyone wants them you know key risks political risks australia 's used to be pretty low it 's now actually coming up for us supply supply supply raw material what drives us you know implementation money profitability is it investable supply chain costs again raw material costs for us because that 's what drives us for some people it 's widgets and wadgets how do you get them out of china that 's the same with us building a factory i 'll just make a note on that you know with widgets and stuff like that even we get chippers vermeer out of out of the states two years ago if i wanted to get a new screen for my chipper i could have it in seven days the last one took five months we 're having to hold stock on the shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um as a line item in your capital expenditure um otherwise you 're going to get caught because i know we did and that you know i think that 's one of the issues the world 's constantly changing isn 't it and we 're either going to stay you know we 're either going to keep the initiative or we 're going to lose the initiative you know i always think of it as i have this picture that this is how i manage things i 'm a visual person you know and so i think i 've got all these balls that i 'm juggling you know his as our finances you know he 's our staff you know he 's our supply you know here 's my personal well-being have we considered that my team 's personal well-being have we considered that i 'm not talking health and safety i 'm talking dealing with the stresses of doing this stuff you know we all need somewhere to unwind we all need a plan for that you know i think i went too hard at it for too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just trying to get healthy again market research obviously if you haven 't got a market if you can 't sell it don 't bother making it you know oh we 're going to create a market okay you 've got you know if i was climbing um i 'm trying to think of what 's it the big mountain battle fritz or whatever you say the one up at top of queensland there or that if you 've well if you have to create a market you 're climbing everest now it 's still conquerable but it 's not conquerable if you haven 't identified that that 's much harder because if you won 't face the reality how can you do it you know start a new industry in a new country is a bit of an everest nobody knows what you 're doing nobody understands what you 're doing you 're trying to get investment in our case uh so far i think i 've had was it eight to about 13 or 14 million of investment you know that now i would say that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that i 've become used to and something that i 've become proficient at and i think that that is a key absolute key for anybody considering doing something in this space or any other entrepreneurial or business start space and i would dare to say it from what i 've heard talking to some of the university chaps that even in their space you know they 're spending 20 30 of their time on attracting investment let 's not complain about that it 's a fact of life i spend the same amount of time on an attracting investment if we embrace it and learn more about it and realize that it 's part of our job put our big boy pants on we can do better at it and that that was it 's an attitudinal thing guys and i 'll tell you what that 's how the market embraces it they don 't want someone coming together if you give me some money i can do this you know they want to see your solutions they want to see how your capabilities and they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're looking for they want to see that integrity if you haven 't got that there that 's integrity in every area that 's why they 'll look at your opex they 'll look at your capex operation expenses they 'll look at your capital expenses they 'll look to see how well you 've planned those they 'll look to see how well you 've researched those how you costed those have you got three quotes one quote were you lazy and how you did it does your model make sense does your model show them where they 're going to get their return from when they 're going to get their return biggest mistake i made for a long long time was i wanted to own all myself you know and it 's i didn 't want to be a public company i didn 't want to have to stand up in front of people and uh yet when covert hit i knew that if we didn 't change something and change it quick my dreams were going to be ashes and that and it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just different and that 's the best way to process it you know change the game in your mind then you can change the game on the field so you know when covert hit we saw i had a little company and we 'd started a pilot plant and we 'd raised a little bit of money and we had enough momentum to justify a tilt at accessing more money and that 's the thing is that i really want to point out when you 're looking for money if you don 't budget the cost of looking for money and achieving an investment then you you 're not going to get that investment if you want if i want to go and get eight million dollars which i did back in july um that cost me eight hundred thousand dollars of that eight million it 's no good it 's no good then griping about saying well hang on a minute i wanted eight and i only got 7.2 to use you know what i 'm saying we 've got to be smart about how we and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines you know but that 's basically you know it 's what i 'm speaking from a stock market perspective our country companies listed now listed on 21st of december i did a reverse takeover from my startup essential queensland we took overleaf resources we basically took over their debts and did a merger and ended up with 77 ownership of that company brought them vision brought them direction bought them a team that could execute a business plan which is the plan that essential queensland had and now that leaf has it 's that 's innovation in itself but you know there are other ways that you can do it certainly investors when they can see the exit and understand how they 're going to make their money because a lot of these businesses these guys at this stage at the high risk stage are not looking for a 10 return on profitability that doesn 't turn their wheels they 're looking for what 's called a multiple they 're looking for a four-fold or a five-fold or as tenfold depending on where you are in the in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you only get that in in really one place which is on the actual markets that 's when the 10 percenters or the you know after tax six you know the six percent has come in once you 've proven that once you 've got the business and a steady kill trading and so forth so um and i guess that just talks about you know for us pilot proof of concept yep we all know that we 've got to show ourselves we 've got to show the investors we 've got to build our capability everything that we 're doing is about capability site selection for us you know manufacturing if you can 't get if you can 't get a site if you can 't get a a place to call home and and go about your business you 've got no project and you know i 've i 've been very vocal in in the support and my support for the bundberg council and how they found us at home um some of the state um people as well and uh and that that 's i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that because that 's bankable it 's bankable from the investors and those those same investors are all about making sure you do make a buck they 'll hold you to account to your business plan certainly donate at the moment um investment ready everything i 'm talking about there is about having all those balls up in the air so when an investor comes along and he has a look because you know what they got 99 reasons to invest and you 've probably all heard there 's only one not two they only need one reason to say well mate you haven 't secured your supply i 'll come back when you have you haven 't got your team together you know you haven 't got a leader that can make this happen with a track record i 'll come back when you have remember to tell me how much time i 've got um okay hiren and regional town so i just want to move on a little um attracting talent those are two of our chemical engineers there they are doing we employed both them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great work um we 've put in place in employee incentive schemes why you know the trains going at maryborough is great great news right how we going to deal with having to find another 800 people another 800 homes in a small town for me i look at that and go damn everybody 's all the media attention 's on them how am i going to continue to attract and try to attract good people it 's a threat and it 's something that i need to need to deal with you know all our staff the entire workforce is on a bonus incentive scheme company makes makes a profit if the guy that 's packing the resin off doesn 't necessarily have a university degree i think i 've got most of my staff and the senior levels operator up chemical engineers process engineers mechanical engineers civil engineers if i can get an engineer out of university i will take them tomorrow we just sign them up you know and that we invest in them um we then do focus a lot on on the vision we focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know we 're doing something everybody 's about them you know everyone 's about the environment everyone 's about that sustainability when you can actually give somebody a you know say well we 're actually doing it you know every every bit of rosin we make removes resin oils petrochemical oils from a marketplace every kilo takes a kilo out that 's a real simple cell you know um but you know and people get that so but staff retention that 's what i talk about with the employment incentives game you know how do we keep them you know it 's everyone talks about oh there 's unemployment and all that guys we all know let 's be real we 're looking for the best you don 't want to employ somebody who doesn 't want to be at work you don 't want to employ someone who just doesn 't give a toss or that they 're covering their own ass when they should be working on the business we want our employees working on the business not just in the business you know if we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll move on ah back to the back to the uh employment thing um i 've got a couple of stories one is i have a a quite a where that 's not faish pippa she 's not in here um one of my engineers she 's a white blonde white queensland girl and uh that but most of my people have ten different nationalities working for me uh five different religions non-religious don 't care don 't give a damn you know um but they all applied in bundaberg here for the same houses little white he got offered the lot all the others didn 't even get looking that 's a message the um also my production manager wonderful young man he was selling perfume in myers when i found him on the gold coast civil engineer he was promoted to our production manager by the other staff and supervisors that were working with them he 's an iranian i have he 's got as much passion as i have for this for what we do and how we do it and that he was attacked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him a wok it was a racial attack what are we doing as a community in the regions you know we talk about staff retention that 's my key guy you know i can 't tell how pissed i am but i am about that it 's not acceptable and it 's not acceptable for us as a community to stand by and do it now i 've brought that up i brought it up you know with some people here in in leadership and uh and it was given very quickly moved on in the conversation so that 's why i 'm bringing it up today because it 's not acceptable to move it on in the conversation everybody these are human beings that 's my best mate there collie that guy got me out of fiji in a coup when bona marana was chasing me to arrest me he put me on a plane without going through customs but he 's also a hell of an engineer you know took us what nine months to get you in the country but if he was coming to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know because what was some of us too lazy to get out of bed to go pick fruit we 're in a hard time you know he 's the only other expert on making rosin in australia he worked with me in fiji where we got that industry up and exporting hundreds of tons got closed down by coup fine but we haven 't given up staff retention big deal um okay the other my other bug bear compliance i talked about at the start i want to just finish on it you know we had a health and safety officer come on i fired a guy for refusing to comply with health and safety he he was driving a forklift hours without a license without permission with half a ton of diesel and an ibc on the front and on and it was just everywhere it wasn 't tied down i waved him down he stopped i said mate what are you doing he swore he left he then with his with his uh leave the form that he was given for why he was dismissed he then put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint into worksafe and that complaint read they are using forklifts on that site in an unsafe manner cutting fuel i 'm not joking the guy told us but every complaint must be investigated and we 're in the stage at that point of just moving as we talked about earlier from third world of first world starting a business building looking at that this guy came through us he came on the site the day before i 'd had two politicians on site bad move because i mentioned or i didn 't mention that he knew that and he thought one had been what 's a bloke pit apparently used to be a work safe invest guy and uh he 's actually had a ticket book sorry i nearly dropped you a bomb had a ticket book said uh i 'm gonna have to be hard on you guys because i know pit you know as an investigator well that 's a threat in it do we want government to be empowering us or do we want them to be policing us and closing us down before we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a policy of empowerment around work safe health and safety about compliance all the various issues come in by all means do an audit help us through this from where we are as a startup business to a fully functional business if you want to give money out to winners a winner is a business that wants to comply there not grants for this that or the other you know look there 's a whole big financial sector to go and get money and raise money at but the hardest thing that we have to do is make sure we 're in compliance and guess what all engineers and all those people that want to provide the services around us they 're going to win too because they get those they get the jobs of helping us become compliant needs to be a process come in do an audit put together a plan and an implementation plan and a payment plan i 'm getting from startup from whoa to go if otherwise we 're not going to get manufacturing going businesses will fail and fail and fail because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're down thanks thank you so much ray so many really practical and valuable learnings there ray is going to be part of the panel later on so if you have any questions for ray please put them on slido and we 'll be using those later on with that example in children 's i think we all have to call it out if we ever see anything like that go up to the person and say that it 's not acceptable we all have a part to play anyway that 's my little soapbox is that right well just want to remind you about photography and videography um if you are um we will be taking um photos and videos obviously today for council social media channels if you don 't want to be involved in that please go and see kate and emily and let them know if you don 't want to be part of that right well let 's get on to our next speaker dr christine williams christine is currently chair of the board of life sciences queensland limited she took on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2018 after 22 years in a number of very different senior positions christine 's final role in the queensland public service was as queensland chief scientist where she was accountable for science policy and providing strategic guidance across a range of government departments her firm belief is that much more can be achieved through working in collaboration than through working alone and we talked about that a lot yesterday and it 's great to see it 's coming up again she is passionate about the role science can play in improving lives here and abroad the role citizen scientists can play in collecting information and the key role that women have in achieving better outcomes in stem and business i would have to agree with you there christine christine is an economist with a director of philosophy from the university of queensland and a master of philosophy from oxford university she is an adjunct professor at the university of queensland chair of the advisory committee for the arc centre of excellence for engineered quantum systems immediate past chair of the queensland chapter of the women in economics network and patron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please welcome dr christine williams and i know why i 'm busy i thought i was retired but it doesn 't seem to be working that way good morning everyone and thank you so much for inviting me to be part of the important discussions in bundaberg can i begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land where we meet today the terrible young people and i pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging and acknowledge them as the first scientists innovators and inventors on this land the development of the bioeconomy is an important opportunity for queensland 's future economic and social development and provides an opportunity for the state and relevant stakeholders to work together to drive the development of technologies that will make our lives and environment cleaner safer and healthier as i said my name is christine williams and i 'm chair of life sciences queensland what is life sciences people ask me all the time what is what are life sciences and they basically we can say it 's the science to feed fuel and heal the people of queensland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very wide amber as you can see there 's a lot of relevant words up there for today 's and yesterday 's discussions so life sciences queensland is a queensland peak body representing queensland life sciences industry and we offer opportunities for industry stakeholders from universities to startups to larger industry players to come together and cooperate to grow their businesses and help capture a dynamic internationally competitive and sustainable life sciences sector in queensland we also work very closely with governments to ensure an appropriate policy environment exists for the life sciences sector to flourish and we also tell them a lot of stories about you so anyone who needs to have stories told about their business let life sciences queens their nob office will join the life sciences queensland and then we 'll tell lots of stories about your successes and get people excited in government because i think that 's one of the things that we do so well is telling stories and anyone who 's interested we have a podcast series as well that interviews quite a few the leading lights we 're really delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn about the exciting developments taking place and recognize that regional queensland is a really important part of life sciences people tend to think of life sciences in terms of human health and i think that in southern southeast queensland that is how they see life sciences and certainly over the last 18 months the discovery of vaccines the discovery of rapid treatments have um have certainly taken the front pages but the broader bioeconomy is where we 're going to find solutions to the world 's problems beyond the immediate threat of covert 19. so it talks a lot about the bioeconomy what is it basically it 's production use and conservation of biological resources for me as an economist it 's a different way of looking at the economic system which actually tries to balance the environment the social and the economic i was always referred to as kermit when i was in queensland treasury because i was too green for them and i was very happy to move over to the environmental side of things so um for me discovering the donor economics sort of mod model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and environmental factors and it 's not just about economic growth and that 's what this is all about the bioeconomy is all about growing the economy sure but doing in a way that gives good value jobs to communities and preserves the environment for future generations so that 's what gets me out of bed in the morning in that in today 's world for seeking net zero carbon emissions is a new holy grail the scope for innovative solutions in the bioeconomy to assist in that journey appeared to be unlimited we 've heard about some of the great stories and innovations innovative solutions being used in this area to address these issues and biotechnology lies at the heart of many of these solutions we 've heard about using waste waste streams as a resource to create new value added out of something that either had no value or a negative value in the past and these products have can be food feed by energy and that is really at the buy economy finding value in things that previously didn 't have a value and creating things so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn 't enough i mean it 's maybe strange to someone 's got three economics degrees to say that but i always felt that you know focusing on gdp and employment numbers is not enough we need to be broader than that so why is it important the bioeconomy delivers a triple bottom line approach and solutions need to deliver not only environment not only economic and business business financial solutions but they have to be environmentally sustainable but they also have to look in the the social societally sustainable modeling solutions as well so regional australia and indeed a lot of non-urban places around the world have been suffering from population loss over decades and some communities struggle with this to be able to maintain a viable population and buy economy projects which at their heart rely on regional inputs such as feedstocks offer a potential lifeline to these communities i 'm not suggesting bundaberg is in that position are saying i think you 've got a very thriving economy here but i was in wonderland just recently for the camel races there their 2016 census numbers was 556. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that we have a few numbers no they only could cater for 70 dinners that night and uh we were told we could go to the service station and pick up a stake there i was saying sitting in a service station having a stake is the low point so how can you have a viable community we ask kids to tell us what would make their community better and they said a bakery we don 't have a bakery let 's have a pub where we got someone who 's not grumpy running the pub yeah it was really an insight from young people for the best ones but for them are there resources nearby that they could transform and make some bioeconomy outputs from there as we saw yesterday wastewater treatment plants are almost everywhere so surely we could be looking to them so where does innovation fit in well innovation is a bit of my hobby horse so i 'll say that now i think that we can 't do anything without thinking differently and the bioeconomy is an area where there is enormous potential due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial technologies along with local knowledge but it 's about bringing people together you don 't get one single science coming up with innovative solutions it 's where you bring people together and that 's another of my favorite things is to bring people together with like interests i am a bit of a uh i say we 've been looking at the innovative approaches being taken uh and innovative thinking is and again that the whole issue of seeing waste not as a waste but as a resource that 's a turn of thinking that is you know it 's only happened recently so how do we actually do that technology and science are also vital and with things that we have in queensland and innovating is not only about new products it 's about thinking about new ways and we 're talking last night about people who weren 't necessarily great at school but have got great ideas and i think that 's how you capture those great ideas and make them successful so we don 't ban badge people as failures because we didn 't necessarily finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you link them with someone who can actually make the idea real so that 's a challenge i set out to you and i think we 've also seen that crises speed up innovation brilliantly 18 months ago we had no vaccine for coronavirus nobody thought we could have one so we 've managed to prove that wrong we 've all been vaccinated i hope um and if not why not and rapid testing was really restricted to either getting your pin prick for diabetes or for pregnancy but now we have rapid testing for so many things a lot of the regulatory hurdles that were mentioned in the previous talk were have just been knocked down people have seen there 's a crisis so let 's use crises to try and fix things let 's regulate for innovation not regulate to stop innovation and i think that we need to push ideas so why in queensland well queensland does have a lot of waste but we have a lot of other things too we have a rich biodiversity we have very good quality feedstocks and we have skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in innovation and the bioeconomy so life sciences queensland hosted the bioeconomy workshop in in brisbane recently and i think that it was a huge success from the point of raising the profile of the bioeconomy i think the other thing that we have which is quite unique is the the biodiscovery act and this is a little bit tangential but i think it 's important that you understand it that in 2014 the nagoya protocol was entered into and australia is a signatory to it which looks at the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources so basically if you 're a researcher and you 're actually extracting some value from genetic resources in queensland and then go on and commercialize that you need to be aware of the fact that there are processes to go through before you are actually able to export that product now so queensland went through that legislative change and has now allowed for that and we have a process which can be go through that does not exist in other states so although it may seem as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will help you access international markets and i guess the first exciting project that was developed under these new arrangements is a partnership between university of queensland and the jalanji people aboriginal corporation which involves the extract of nanofibers from spinifex now spin effects is a kind of prickly thing one wouldn 't think it would be something that you would use to in surgical gloves condoms also interestingly on road surfacing but they 've actually got nanofibers which actually increase the as an additive increases the flexibility of surfaces and makes it very possible yet very very thin but very strong surfaces and spinifex grasses cover 30 percent of the continent so do we now have a resource with a different value because we 've found some way to use it i think so we 've heard about how municipal waste can be used to create green energy and about nav house using recycled plastics to build rapidly deployable housing warm water which is used as an offshoot for different industrial processes being used rather than as a problem i mean what you do with warm water you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to walk to make algae which can then go on and be used for fuel or for other other high value products and it wouldn 't be right if i wasn 't in bundaberg and didn 't talk about sugar so obviously we have to talk about sugar and the gas everyone knows it is an incredibly valuable resource now again it used to be looked as a byproduct it was a problem but it 's now being used obviously to generate power for the for the the millers themselves but they 're looking at ways how to make it a valuable animal feed to augment animal supplements and the next time you have a takeaway it could actually have been made out of sugar by gas so the bio pack is making sugarcane based um takeaway containers so i 'm going to finish at that because i think we 've got a bit of time to catch up and thank you all for letting me come and talk to you thank you so much dr christine williams our next speaker is dr clive keenan managing director of wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the solomon islands as well as in bundaberg at the utalitas biohub wide bay pacific has developed a number of partnerships and projects which will establish the wide bay as a focus of activities in the oceania region for farming processing and production of a range of algae derived products clive is an experienced principal agriculture scientist working for daf queensland for 14 years with over 50 publications on a wide variety of topics he has worked in the agricu aquaculture industry for the past 21 years including serving as director aquaculture development for philips foods inc in usa working in the philippines and indonesia as well as the prawn farm manager and aquaculture development consultant in bundaberg please welcome dr clive keenan okay uh thanks very much and uh it 's been a fascinating conference and uh it was a stroke of genius to coincide this with the cop 26 meeting i don 't know if it was done on purpose or if it was it was yeah because we 've got all these important people talking about important things over there and here we are talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this talk i 'm hoping i 've convinced you that there is a role for aquaculture to complete the circle in the carbon bio economy okay how did i become involved in this um last year i inspected the biohub and recognized the potential of the site to demonstrate carbon capture using microalgae it had all the ingredients it had sea water sunlight subtropical climate and co2 as well as nutrients power labs and tanks everything everything that we need and and at that time i thought i was semi-retired but then i ran into malcolm and and we decided to start a business and it hasn 't been gone very long okay next slide this one okay right okay thanks um i 'm going to start off really simple because there 's a huge range of people in the audience from the queensland 's chief scientist to people that probably don 't know a lot about biology the nature 's biodegrading pathways it 's actually pretty simple the there 's aerobic digestion of agricultural waste which is basically composting and the outputs of water co2 to the atmosphere biomass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years the problem at the moment is that plants can 't keep up with the co2 that 's being emitted in the atmosphere the plants on land and in the water so then we come to anaerobic digestion anaerobic digestion is conducted under more controlled conditions or can be and the outputs are biogas which we heard about yesterday biomass nutrients and also water i forgot to put that in so the cons main constituents of biogas are methane and carbon dioxide about 60 40 ratio which we learned yesterday was the ideal ratio for inputting into the re-carbon hydrogen generators there 's als there 's also a bit of stuff in there that needs to be removed uh to make it a useful gas biogas is a valuable and useful resource it 's often harvested from landfills otherwise it 's released the atmosphere contributing greenhouse gases which are responsible for global warming and just today we learned that australia didn 't sign up to the methane pledge at cop 26. so um anaerobic digestion of biogas can be done under controlled conditions in a closed container to capture the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a methane in the in the gas distribution network needs to remove the carbon dioxide and the process is that we can use the co2 to stimulate algal growth and reduce production costs other sources of clean co2 uh alcohol fermentation and flue gases from burning uh fossil fuels or in fact gas from the methane distribution network which is a much cleaner source of carbon dioxide and the bottom line for us is that a ton of co2 will produce approximately 500 kilos of microalgae in fact the ratio can be one to six so it can be about 600 kilos so it 's a real sink for carbon dioxide um you note the date on this 26th of october very recent uh date a bit of the news item um about young henry 's craft brewery i was speaking with jack about this yesterday he said he saw a plant doing this in the united states in 2007 next to a brewery so it 's not new but for young henry 's it was back five years ago young henry 's set up an algae plant it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it which is this one here that thing it 's got algae in it and what they are thinking of doing is along the lines of us that they are investigating if microalgae can reduce methane emissions by producing a feed for cattle and sheep that 's their latest take on it uh just for reference the co2 from fermentation of just one pack of beer takes a tree two full days to absorb and and also the 400 liter bioreactor produces as much oxygen as one hectare of australian forest so i want you to remember that 400 sorry 400 liters is equivalent to one hectare of forest okay um we are proposing to grow microalgae using a well-established bivalve hatchery technology it 's about 50 years old this technology and it 's interesting because there 's so many ways of growing algae in bioreactors but this particular one was designed to be simple semi-automated and foolproof well you know i suppose it depends on who 's operating but it provides a continuous production system using bag culture for four months which is quite a long time without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill the bugs before they get into the system and sterilization once a week of the input lines using steam ultra filters the under 0.5 micron would also be suitable as to pasteurize the sea water and there 's a heat if you pasteurize the seawater there 's a heat scavenger that heats up the water going into it so it 's pretty economical the interesting one about this is it provides the ability to scale up into ponds very easily depending on the availability of land and inputs including carbon dioxide for injection into the pond water and i 'll just show you some photos of the system this is a 18 bag system each bag is about 4 000 liters so it 's equivalent to 10 hectares of forest if you remember what i said before and this is a close-up of the bags um in this particular hatchery which is in south australia they grow four species of algae and not the one that we 're targeting but the one that we are targeting which is a nanochloropsis which has been used in aquaculture for 50 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the one we 're targeting but this system can be used for for nanochloropsis those those they 're air bubbles that travel up the bag so presumably their oxygen coming out of the algae and they 'll be released to the atmosphere and they cause a little there 's no huge turbulence in these bags but the the air bubbles moving up the bags create its own turbulence okay so i 'm going to talk a little bit about pond production of algae i went to sorry i went to the university of queensland professor pierre schenck has a demonstration farm that deploys new cost-saving technologies to produce food feed nutraceuticals or biodiesel from microalgae the algae energy farm that he that he created was officially opened on the 19th of august in 2014 it 's an off-grid 250 000 litre demonstration module that utilizes in-house expertise to demonstrate industrial scale low-cost cultivation harvesting and drying technologies tailored for micro algae production through continued optimization of the production process at the panjara shenklab are currently yielding an estimated 600 barrels of biodiesel and 50 tons of algae biomass per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a combination of the module with anaerobic digestion will allow fertilizer recycling for operation as a zero input algae energy farm so this is where it starts to the the linkage between the biogas and and the algae farm starts okay the woods group in gundawindi is the first to develop commercially developed this technology for their feedstock and food products business and here 's a fairly recent article covered by the abc this is 16th of june last year this is in gunda and they grow the nanochloropsis and this is using bore water and it 's for basically [Music] incorporation into animal feeds but recently they 've developed a new product which is going into the human uh the for human feed which is where the real money is i suppose you 'll notice here that it 's 42.1 protein and has a very high fat or oil content total omega-3 fatty acids which are the really valuable ones five point six or almost six percent the protein the nanochloropsis protein has a well-balanced amino acid profile has all the essential and branch chain amino acids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beef i 've got two slides okay next one this is the qualitas health algae farm in columbus new mexico usa it 's 150 hectares this farm was actually developed in the united states they 've had a massive government funding program for biodiesel production and it has it has uh stimulated a lot of research in the u.s and this farm was built when the price of oil was going through the roof with government funding then when the price of oil collapsed so did the business but it is now been taken over by qualitas health for human uh human for the production is for human consumption this 150 acres and on their website they say it 's equivalent to 45 000 acres of peas the algae is 300 times more productive than growing peas okay this is a close-up of the ponds it 's very simple they 're very shallow they run at about 30 centimeters and there 's a paddle wheel very low input paddle wheel just keeping the pond stirring and you 'll see here there 's nutrient inputs there 's and in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually the carbon dioxide because this farm is 1500 kilometers inland on the border of new mexico and mexico i think it 's it 's a long way inland it uses more water which is fairly sterile the co2 increases the growth rate by four to five times and it costs about two dollars a kilo to bring in the liquefied carbon dioxide into this facility to make the algae grow so you can see why we 're so interested in the biohub site because it is the the carbon dioxide is right there either coming from the biogas cleaning up the biogas or as you heard yesterday from the recarbon uh hydrogen production system that it 's food grade carbon dioxide that 's coming out of there um right and finally actually i had three slides sorry this is uh the many uses of microalgae so it it is the most one of the most primitive plants on earth it 's been living for hundreds of millions thousands of millions of years and it has all the all the uh essential chemicals to basically create a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chemicals used in the petroleum industry um there 's one important line that isn 't in there gun straight from fermentation to the algae production ponds which is the the carbon dioxide from fermentation of alcohol and there 's a lot of that in bundaberg buddy rum i 'm not sure what they do with their carbon dioxide but if we can take it off we 'd be happy to do that um okay thank you thank you very much dr clive keenan well our next guest speaker is jack milbank director of novum life sciences biofilm who is also part of the ag tech hub at bagara jack has worked in applied science across agriculture i.t beverages hospitality animal genetics synthetic biology and wholesale distribution for over 20 years based in bergara jack is involved to varying degrees in a network of companies including hortus bio film ballistic heartwood and ag pro across australia singapore japan usa and southern africa jack is a passionate triathlete truly cattle producer beer fan and father of three beautiful daughters for manufacturing biotic hydro mulch to gluten removal enzymes to bioinsecticides for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for better management of difficult problems jack sees the bundaberg bio economy as a great hub for the development of naturally innovative solutions for agriculture but sees the need for more economically viable modular and collaborative pilot projects to be established with better access to seed capital for the region 's businesses to compete on a global stage please welcome jack milbank thanks for the welcome and morning everybody i know i 'm between you and a cup of coffee so i 'll try and keep it interesting and uh i suppose it 's been great to hear over the last day and a half a lot of focus on energy and um i want to bring a bit of diversity um to the to the discussion and i suppose my involvement in this region has been um across a number of different avenues from you know primarily an agricultural base but we 've recently moved to a much broader life science uh portfolio which we we conducted a a merger of our own companies uh and yeah i just want to take you through some of the interesting points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some thought-provoking ideas and to stimulate discussions so that over tea and and lunch um you 've got more things to discuss and and the opportunities uh present themselves uh as many of you know i 'm very passionate about food production and beverage production and the the the biological uh assets and intellectual property the support food production and so we look at things through uh different lenses at times and um but i want to take you through some of the ways in which we evaluate um establishing businesses um i suppose we 2020 was a taking stock year for me 2021. uh so a little bit of background i grew up in zimbabwe in a sort of a landlocked africa on the middle of a cattle property and so we we farmed uh cattle and and game um and i didn 't anticipate yeah moving to australia at all you know the the plan was to come get a degree go back and and run horseback safaris on a game farm in the middle of africa but things are things turned out differently um and so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozvig so we were doing um industry development of research and development funds so it 's a deployment of of vegetable levy money into research projects in northern australia did that for a couple of years and that was sort of the only job i had actually i left university worked for somebody else for two years and said bugger this and started my own companies and and haven 't stopped so from when i was 25 i arrived at university with a suitcase and was told not to come home so i basically just had to start from scratch and um anyway we 're now 20 years later i thought okay let 's just stop and take a breath and uh so we reorganized our sort of involvement in a few companies um and re-prioritized where we you know the strategic direction and what we wanted to do and it 's amazing when you do that i 'd forgotten what i 'd wanted to do i 'd just been on the treadmill just going hard and doing things and it sort of dawned on me and i 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second but um so we we formed uh well i actually purchased crop tech which was an original bundaberg business established by john penny hall in the mid-80s so i bought that off john deere in 2009 uh we then set up biofilm crop protection as the first biofungicide manufacturer linking into some of the similar stories my wife and i were pests and disease you know bug checkers uh wandering through the tomato fields of bundaberg with a bit of bulldog and lanai and interself and getting sprayed around and i thought this is not what i want to be feeding my kids and so we we investigated into the you know development of uh micro you know bacteria to control you know biology to control uh problems we at the time were um releasing beneficial insects you know using ipm to control insects and and then at that point there was severe outbreaks of um yellow leaf curl virus and tomatoes and so we were looking at ways of controlling bacteria that affects tomato production and so i went looking for other bacteria that would be stronger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into bio fermentation and and so we 've been in this for a very long time now sort of nine years we 've got a portfolio of about 40 different organisms we 've got a 5 000 liter bioreactor that we manufacture on using evacuated solar tubes in a closed loop system so we we 're energy neutral we capture rain water we 've got a reverse osmosis process so we have zero waste and zero energy and so we 've been doing this since 2013. we then set up bagara brewing company as a as a brewery with that similar similar mindset where we captured rainwater and that was foundation to to have a zero circular economy um and i was fortunate in i did a nuffield scholarship in 2006 and and i was looking at globally competitive horticultural production processing marketing using renewable energy as the backbone of the supply chain with a net benefit on regional environments and economies so for me i 've been looking at circular economies since since the beginning and i don 't think of doing business in any other way for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they contribute to one another and building a network so we we 're great we have a a good team of employees now but i 'm more interested in in developing partnerships with independent businesses so we 've got a much much bigger network of independent agronomists advisors vets experts because as we know as soon as people leave university uh they either tend to go down a career path or corporate career path or if they 've got their own ambitions they then start their own companies and so we end up working having a lot of people that work for us for two one two three four years and then go on and start their own agronomy consultancy or work with other clients and all of those people continue to be our customers 20 years later so we work closely with a number of universities and yeah that just gives us fantastic access to ongoing as as applied scientists we take research and we apply it to farms so we 're the intermediary that that underpins the deployment of research outcomes uh so i suppose in in summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection of the various levels of so we hoarse is our service business so it 's an anata and azpac accredited uh laboratory with microbiology uh capability um we 've just bought a new thermo fisher icp so we can do part per billion analyses on any substance um and you know i suppose that 's across soil um sap water you know a range of things um and then biofilm is our inoculant and microbial manufacturing division um so we we 're quite involved in providing alternative to alternatives to synthetic fertilizers so we we produce azos beryllium zodobacter which are both nitrogen fixing bacteria for that are not reliant on legumes so as a replacement in reef sensitive production systems we would rather use biology to extract nutrients that are already there that farmers have been applying to soil for 200 years well let 's just extract that and make it more usable to plants so we we use bacill bacillus emilio que liquifessions is a phosphate solubilizing bacteria um and then we have entomopathogenic fungi that we use to parasitize pests within uh either pasture systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and have seen this there 's huge growth for certified organic products and it 's not being driven by anyone you know saying i want to be organic it 's been driven by consumers demanding it demanding organic products at the supermarkets which then is forcing the larger suppliers of fruit and vegetables to develop an organic line to continue supply to to the supermarkets and then in order to do that they can come to us and go we we 're a big corn bean you know whatever supplier but we now have to develop up organic production systems can you help us and so we then start replacing one at a time the synthetic organ you know by controls or fertilizers with organic replacements so that they then can provide a higher margin consistent supply of organic certified product to the supermarkets so obviously there 's been a lot of noise around soil carbon and obviously being an agronomist we 've looked at soil science for for many many years so in the gas project i did the the soil management plan and a soil survey for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took soil tests every kilometer down to two meters for 400 kilometers so i i personally had land cruisers collecting soils classifying them collect you know generating the results the recommendations of how much gypsum to stabilize the sodic base beneath the pipeline but now with with carbon there is another realm and i think the it 's only just dawning on people the value and importance of sore carbon in the next by 2030 and then by 2050 it 's it 's a pretty big space and we test an awful lot of soil and we 've got a lot of historical carbon test results and and we i suppose wannabe play a big part in the management of that data that underpins verification of management practices on farm to sequester more carbon and and uh improve productive output of that that orchard or that farm and so measurement of all of those soil tests and the sops led us into the data world and so last year we we formed we spun off our own software division and called it ag pro well it 's called lexi tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lexi tech is our uh i suppose global headquarters and ag pro technologies are ag platform that manages all of the data around agriculture and so we have licensees now so novum within and hortos analytical and bundy is the australia one of the australian licensees we work with pioneer in japan and then we have other licenses in in south africa chile and and america but that is around the auto generation of nutrient budgets so n p budgets and and i think we 're in a very strong position given the compliance required for reef you know the reef legislation forces us to adopt best practice and that we can now export that intellectual property in the form of systems procedures data connectivity and access to agricultural systems everywhere else in the world and obviously the use of biology to sequester more carbon is an i still think it 's over simplification there 's there 's going to be a healthy soil system which will grow the ability for it to retain you know have a higher cation exchange capacity and an ability to sequester more carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the way in which the venture capital world and and raising capital works you know everybody puts their hat on or their bets on one horse and and you 've got to be able to define it but it 's a it 's a far broader story so to touch on some of the biological opportunities um so we i suppose we 're at the currently focused on bioremediation of soils so whether it 's it 's increased fertility whether it 's by remediation removal of heavy metals or contaminants from mine sites or things like that activation and value addition to composts so we 're doing a lot of work at the moment on prebiotic microbiome priming so determination of what facilitates far better nutrient utilization by livestock um and then obviously sort of replacement of fungicides and cropping so by fungicidal activity and cropping um so we obviously then through the service delivery we offer quite an extensive dna and and pathogen diagnosis service for for producers all around the country so they send their samples we isolate get a pure culture sequence it and then start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what might work to control some of those those pathogens in enhancing biomethane recovery and consistency in the way in um a deployed known controlled environmental biology that might enhance uh recovery of specific compounds as opposed to uh allowing nature to take its course we enhance it by provision of a an optimized population so it might be 10 to the nine cfus per ml of us of a specific organism that it 's going to extract as uh specific metabolites out of the feedstock um yeah and then obviously we do a little bit of enzyme production so all the enzymes begin with the as an excretion from different organisms and then the downstream filtration of those so so we 're working with with glutenase reduction and and manufacturing of an ingredient for the addition to flour so that it it can be provided as a gluten-free flour to bakers um yeah and there 's hydromash i 'll touch on it it 's a quite a long process with binding agents but ideally what we 're looking to do is regain access to that that baked layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over if we can apply a bonded fiber matrix hydro mulch that 's in two layer process that 's bio-fortified uh then harvesters can go over the saw will recover underneath it but we still have a nice harvestable bed on top of the hydromush and then beer we all know about that that 's the most fun one and babies is our latest one and there 's going to be some raised eyebrows but i 'll explain this in a second so enzymes so we we have good scientists work for us but we we look at each enzyme produced by which organism and then understand what feature or function that enzyme has and whether it breaks down starch does it uh you know chitinase so there 's fantastic opportunities with crab shell you know there 's there 's so many opportunities of not just the organism but the enzymes that those organisms produce for for reactions to occur to develop and so there 's more ideas and opportunities here than i 've got to fulfill in a lifetime so that 's why we need so many more credible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a center of innovation in the bioeconomy and not just one two three four key projects there 's a plethora and we need to get cracking on it because otherwise other places are going to overtake us so as i said yeah we 've been doing this for a few years now [Music] i want to touch briefly on livestock so we 've only been back in this in the last uh in the last 12 months so back to the start i i 've forgotten what i wanted to do when i was a kid i wanted to have a bull stud and i and so i suddenly realized holy car forgot that 's what i wanted so we then had some ability to do it so we we bought a nice property that 's got 20 acres of mangroves of which i want to seed some microalgae and i think it 's fantastic what the algae guys are doing because for by you know reduction of methane uh we 've obviously the likes of future feed and aspar gospels production in this area um there 's there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both grass-fed and livestock fed animals and for growth as well as reproductive capacity i 'm out of time a bit but you know we all sort of know what 's required to scale up um but i want to touch on these couple of slides quickly so this is sort of scale up you know in in the bioeconomy we 're basically replicating organisms you know and we stop whether we start with a bacteria whether we start with an atom a compound or you know it 's it 's replication is what we 're sort of doing so a base level by stimulants five bucks a liter a by control might be ten bucks a liter an enzyme may be 20 bucks a liter so as you sort of go down that the price goes up um you know to make at 500 grand a year revenue you know you 're looking at 100 000 liters of uh buy stimulant 50 000 as a buy product or 25 000 liters of enzyme and generally as you scale you tend to get a bit more efficient but interesting your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's okay um you 've got to get big and there 's quite a long lead time and and there 's some issues with it um when and and that 's because it 's capital intensive when you buy those assets they depreciate and there 's a business case that 's quite difficult to to explain so when we look at a cow most people would look at that and envisage a big steaming pile of crap that comes out the other side whereas i look at with the methane that 's coming out it 's a little bioreactor on its own that 's just we don 't have to process anything we just it eats grass and i can leave it right there and build the soil biology that grass goes in uh what 's the most the highest value thing that it we can replicate um well at the moment many of you may have seen some of the you know there is about a 25 000 head shortage of cattle in australia because of seven eight years of drought so that 's why bulls are worth two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now of enzyme production uh sorry enzyme embryo production so we 're working with embryologists and we we 're flushing embryos out of pedigree heifers um merging them with our genetics and then selling embryos around the world um the the thing about that is the smaller the better its attention to detail its ability to manage it carefully uh and the more efficient the bigger you get the less efficient you become because you start you know you 're rushing through the system where if you you 've got smaller scale tighter control uh more attention to detail with nutrition and the higher the value and the scarcity of the the things that you you 're providing so in that instance you get a a much better return on investment um so so we 've set about we 're australia 's newest cattle breed so i i 'm the the one and only registered uh so under arc by the australian registered cattle breed so we own all the tule genetics we register them we manage the animals we then coordinate globally the supply and the no more is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ australia and like all good research no one picked it up and did anything with it so i came along and saw it and it actually was picked up but as a part of a composite herd and then then certain acquisitions occurred and and the the turley nucleus herd was killed and there was 43 purebred animals left and so we did a deal and we we now manage the entire thule genome so we 're working with the bill and melinda gates foundation we 've sequenced all of our animals and yeah we 're now i suppose looking for specific locations on that genome for tb resistance genes that has massive implications for the gates foundation if they find a tuberculosis resistance gene that will come off our two genetics which is 5 000 years of continuous lineage which is why it 's a pretty cool project to be working on and obviously csiro brought it into australia because it 's heat tolerant and we 're a desert and makes sense uh so in just to sum up uh i suppose for success in in this bioeconomy space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a you know you need to consider your bioreactor design and then you need data to support the value of the finished product and then procedures and tools to monitor the performance and then replicate your success obviously must fulfill the need must achieve market acceptance at the quality and quantity able to consistently replicate that process need to be able to effectively educate the market on the unique value proposition that you 're presenting and there needs to be availability of expertise to assist it in its scale and i think bundaberg has has a lot of that and the ability to fulfill a lot of these things and the value of the assets products and processes should appreciate over time not depreciate so thank you very much if um ag pro 's up and running out of singapore now our cattle i haven 't shared many photos of things but that 's what social media is for so we 're on instagram and and facebook and and um linkedin for uh thule for our cattle ag pro for our digital technology and and systems and then november life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to having chat with you guys over tea thanks very much thank you so much jack milbank what fantastic innovations happening in our region well it 's morning tea time um we 'll need to be back in the room by 11 30 so if you could actually go and get something come back in at your leisure um we 've got still got a lot to get through and we 've got to get on that bus for the um for the site tours a little bit later so make your way out for morning tea if you haven 't filled out the poll yet on slido please do that we 're going to be having a word cloud a little bit later as well on the one thing that the conference means to you describe it in a word what you 've learned what 's been great about it we 'll get that up soon thanks everyone enjoy morning tea we 'll see you back in here at 11 30. extensive industry experience cameron has acquired three masters degrees in construction management entrepreneurship and innovation and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fillion award for entrepreneurial excellence when studying in switzerland and also was granted a secular economy award for winning the australian technologies competition in 2019. cameron is passionate to create solutions for a sustainable future with a focus on circular procurement clean tech and reducing the waste in the construction and manufacturing industries gentlemen are we right to get cameron online what 's going on um hi hi everyone uh thank you very much uh for your time my name 's cameron mckenzie i 'm from aspire i 'm going to do things a little bit different at the moment i 've got a slide deck but what i might do is i might share with emily and the team after after the presentation there 's reasons for that really because i 'm also sitting in hong kong at the moment and there 's also sometimes we have issues with uh sharing documents and information um sometimes it works sometimes it doesn 't so uh yes i thought i 'll just have a bit of a chat and talk to you a little bit about what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform so a little bit about it is basically what aspire is it 's a it 's a marketplace for businesses of any size to transact and and exchange resources or excess commodities um as as a obviously as a like a co-sharing exercise or to save money so what we do is we have we work with a lot of local governments um and state government in queensland we work with like moreton bay i think it 's logan gold coast sunshine coast noosa and redland and what we do is we work with them to engage their businesses to build a circular economy so they can they can share excess resources and waste products what i 'll do is i 'll give you a little bit of example of of how it works so um a prime example is we had a business um in in victoria that had about 20 i think about 20 odd tons of agricultural products that would normally end up straight in the landfill and what we did is they listed those products onto aspire and what we actually did is we found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than going to landfill so off the back of that we saved the supply side a lot of money from not having to actually send those items to landfill and what we did is on the demand side we actually found a free feed stock for them oh well they had to have to pay for the transportation to pick it up but end of the day what we did is we we connect these businesses to create more sustainable outcomes and longevity to these business communities so far we have um over i think it 's 850 odd businesses in australia at the moment that transact we divert over 45 000 tonnes from products from landfill again is uh it 's nothing to sneeze at and what we also do is we have over 200 different types of commodities that can get exchanged so it can be anything from construction products to timber to furniture to agricultural products um we have plastics we have a lot of pellets to get exchange on the platform and what we do is we we bring these partners together and these businesses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and we 're we 're super proud to be um on this on this webinar today and working with um with bundaberg and the water and the water bay area to see what we can do for the local economy we have lots of farmers and a lot of retail as well as manufacturing that use the platform in in in the southern states in because we originally came from victoria and off the back of that too we also came from csiro and data61 so they actually built the platform over several years and and after after a successful pilot program it switching to commercial operations and from there we 've been expanding across the country which will be doing quite well we 're in tasmania victoria um queensland new south wales and we 're about to deliver and take off in perth which is great um one of the things about aspire again that makes it quite um an easy sort of platform is we actually sit in the cloud so there 's no software or download software or hardware um you need to download or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're off to go and we can organize and help businesses obviously exchange these these products um rather than send them to landfill yeah as i sort of sort of spoke about is i 'm actually sitting in um hong kong at the moment so back in 2019 we won australian technologies competition and with that two of the judges um they worked for a big organization over in hong kong and i asked if we could bring the software over here and i 've been here for the last probably um seven months now getting the platform ready to develop and to launch so you know um you know there 's a lot of uh there 's a lot of noise sort of coming at the moment when it comes to circular economy and sustainability and i know um there 's the cop26s going on at the moment and there 's been some pretty ambitious targets that have been um set by the federal government um as well as you know global governments and and i think that basically by using a platform like aspire we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of going to net zero one other oh sorry two of the key features that i 've got in aspire that make it again um quite attractive is we can actually measure um scope three embodied carbon measurement so a lot of organizations do a lot regarding the scope one and scope two and what we do is we 've got a tool an aspire that measures um every item that gets exchanged and it also gives you an embodied carbon measurement which is iso certified so a lot of the organizations um depending on the on the level that they 're at some of them i 'm not the big end of town they really need to sort of start hitting these objectives and we 've got i 'm a smaller into town that really sort of like to use it for the sort of cost saving measures yeah i 'm not quite sure if everyone 's aware but i think about 80 or even more i think about 95 of the local governments in australia hit a climate crisis about two years ago and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decarbonization targets but it 's also about helping the businesses in the community to to to hit these targets too and what we do is we work a lot with again with lgas to to engage their businesses and the residents within that area to um to help with those with those targets um you know i think back in um at start of the year i think the federal government um they were going to bring in a mandate of a percentage of recycled content in in every pretty procurement process that they do um and one of the things that you know we 've been sort of speaking with um the federal government about is how we can sort of use aspire to to leverage that uh impact for them and that 's one of the main things um as we sort of we 're trying to do as we sort of build aspirin into the ecosystem is to help these businesses um be more sustainable make more well um real life choices and and also to help them thicken their wallets in any way they can um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example um how sort of aspire works basically so we 've got a we had a business in victoria that was uh was starting to get in a lot of trouble it was pre-covered uh just when code was kicking off when it come to their supply chain they 're trying to um they 're trying to import things from overseas and they just couldn 't happen um as you know it was um everything sort of went into lockdown australia was pretty tough um with that but basically through the platform we could actually find a free feedstock i think it was about two kilometers away from from where they 're um from where they 're where they were based um and what it was it was like i think it was majority was a timber product which they 're importing which they actually had um you know another supplier on the platform that we 're actually you know just costing them a lot of money to throw they throw those items out in a skip per week and by matching them on the platform we could actually find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still going today which again it 's it 's amazing sort of um tool that to help these businesses be more sustainable um one of the uh another sort of a great sort of initiative we 've got on the platform is um we 've got i think there 's about four or five businesses that um that collect all the polystyrene um that that sort of get listed on the platform a lot of it as you know polystyrene is um can be a pain in the backside um it breaks up it 's very light blows around yards a lot of transfer stations hate it absolutely hate it but what we do is we 've got businesses on the platform that um when another business sort of lists those items that they can come and collect them directly and normally for free a lot of people just want to get rid of these products and what we do is we help these businesses again be more sustainable but also you know find these um connections uh through a digital platform and we we love working with sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely because it 's all about how they can engage their local communities we 've just recently launched in regional victoria in ballarat and bendigo again and they 're they 're very sort of like a similar sort of area to sort of the bundaberg area that you know they 're regional but you know they 're very important to um to building the community and helping the localised businesses as as things you know they get done a lot closer to home these days so um but what i 'd like to do is again is like thank you very much um for your time um what i 'll do is i 've got a a deck here that i 'll i 'll share with lachlan and emily um and feel free to have a bit of a look at what we 're doing um and there 's a qr code in in one of the pages so if you feel like joining aspire just um pick up your phone hit that uh qr code and it will go straight through to our onboarding process and we would love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area um you know join the spy community because it 's only going to get bigger and we 're a tool where we can save you time and money um on pretty much every resource that you that come in and out of your business so again um thank you very much for your time and i 'll uh yeah and i 'll catch you later thank you can we please thank cameron mckenzie from aspire fantastic once again to see that collaboration in action our next guest speaker is nathan freeman head of planning infrastructure and projects at greenself farming which includes green solutions wide bay as part of his portfolio greenself farming group are leading the way in environmental and sustainable farming practices as one of the region 's largest growers of sugarcane and sweet potatoes from humble beginnings the greenself family have built a legacy spanning generations that continues to develop research and invest in agriculture nathan 's previous roles include consultant town planner with insight sjc for 16 years prior to joining greenfield farming in 2020 nathan is also president of the bundaberg branch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of not-for-profit organizations in the wide bay burnett region registered planner with the planning institute of australia and auxiliary firefighter with queensland foreign emergency services at the bundaberg station and he forgot to mention citizen of the year at this year 's australia day awards please mention um welcome nathan freeman thanks trisha i knew i wouldn 't get away with that one all right i might pinch this because i like to walk around a lot um welcome everybody as trish mentioned i 'm head of planning infrastructure and projects with greenself farming um very exciting part of the business which i 'm here to talk to you about today is green solutions wide bay so green solutions wide bay is our newest venture in the business it 's a um a fully green waste recyclable facility so we we turn green waste into compost and other products so i 'll just give you a quick run through on that today and for those lucky enough today that are doing this bus tours you 'll end up at our facility and i won 't take too much away you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 'll run through that so green seal farming i thought i 'd just give you a bit of background on the company itself we 're 100 family owned been third generation farming in this area since 1945 so we 've just clicked over our 75 years and we have 3 000 hectares of farmland across the bundaberg and wide bay region so quite a big area we do if you ever get down towards the coast hanging off the side of the humming that nice red soil down there a lot of that stuff is all under our production we 've got a farm over at oakwood and then we 've also got one over um or we 've got multiple farms over at um wallable as well so we what do we grow we grow sweet potatoes sugar cane peanuts um we have a civil construction team so we 've got quite a large development team we run around with 70 ton to 30 ton excavators we 've got plenty of scrapers so we 've got a lot of equipment that we help to build our farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an in-house manufacturing capability so we do a lot of our own building of pump sheds pump infrastructure a lot of our sort of implements and things like that as well we also manufacture in-house the team that we employ here locally is over 100 and we have between 30 to 40 seasonal workers during those peak summer months so we get a quite a large team but a fair chunk of them are local some of our supply chain and our partners we supply sweet potatoes with a company called sweet potatoes australia so we we form part of that we are the largest supply sweet potatoes in australia we supply the coals woolworths aldi we also supplied now to a company called simplot which is down in tasmania the first time now that we 've manufactured sweet potato here in australia turned them into chips and put them out there so if you buy your bird 's eyes and all those sort of sweet potatoes in in the supermarket that 's now manufactured here in australia previously we sent them overseas they were put into bags and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the business with our hay crops we also supply it to oraco which you 'll get this afternoon and it pulls up next and um we 're also one of the largest suppliers of peanuts to bigger so bigger peanut butter don 't buy the craft stuff buy the bigger stuff and also isis sugar we obviously have at olive oil we have a large broad hectare farm out there and we send a lot of our sugar across to isis so really good partners so one of the things and the reason why i mentioned that today is as you can see we deal with some really big companies and the one thing that they 're always chasing is quality and they 're also wanting to know more and more where their product comes from so we 've got a really strict compliance within the business as to how we deal with that product they have a strict compliance at their end as to the quality we provide so we need to trace that through the whole process and that goes right through to our compost stage part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design we want to make sure that the farm works for our needs and and our cropping needs we also look at zero health and carbon so um sorry soil health and carbon and zero waste so they 're the two really high sections we focus on and sustainable water usage of water is really massive in the business um anything that enters our site we don 't want to leave the site so we try and utilize it as much as we can technology and automation and then farm machinery and equipment so where did all this come from where was the inspiration around the green solution site it actually came from a trip to san francisco so a group of local farmers shot overseas we 're going through and having a look at different things that were happening around the world and one of the spots they landed was san francisco in san francisco themselves they use a fairly large amount of their green waste and also their food waste through the recycling process and then they put it on their local farms we thought why can 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back they started to look at it and it didn 't take long we commenced construction in october 2020 after we went through a fairly lengthy planning process and really big thanks to bundaberg regional council and department of environment and science obviously the compliance side with all of this is quite quite high so they worked really closely with us to get this thing off the ground as i said construction commenced in october 2020 we officially opened in april 2021 this year so it 's only a really new facility very very green very new so we obviously we 're still testing it we 're still seeing it what works what doesn 't work and the beauty of it is it 's free green waste for anybody in the bundaberg region so there 's no cost associated with it general public commercial contractors all come and utilize our facility all we ask is that they don 't put contaminants in the facility so we 're really strict on how we deal with that and how we monitor that but effectively we get the stuff brought to us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and getting the raw material so if we can get them to deliver it to our site we 've already started in front it 's fully automated so when you turn up there 's some cameras there you 'll see the camera down the bottom there that 's our number plate recognition camera and the one up higher it 'll actually take a photo of your face as you go through so if you try to tell us that it wasn 't you that day that was going through and dumping that contamination on the site we 'll have a photograph to see if it was or was it that particular person we also have the number plate recognition everybody 's invited until they do the wrong thing so we just basically opened it up it 'll pick up the number plate and say yes it 's an approved number plate they 'll come through they come through and they dump onto our pad which you 'll see when you go out there today and as they exit it also reads the number plate to say they 've exited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we allow up to seven vehicles on site at any one time just for safety reasons so and that gives enough space for people to be able to unload so as one person leaves it 'll allow the next person to come through so usually seven is pretty pretty much the good number we use high definition cameras we 've got a camera on there that when we were testing it we sort of panned it around and we had to look into the paddock and we could read the label on the side of the coke can of a guy driving a tractor so really good quality cameras and we obviously need that because we want to be able to monitor and make sure we don 't have contamination because it is unmanned so we 've got somebody there to be able to check on that and to be honest with you the general public are really good if it 's free and and they know it 's free they generally work really closely with us to make sure that doesn 't happen the best one that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a lot of money to to to dump their waste so they 're the first ones to sort of grab somebody and say hey look you probably need to take that plastic bag home with you so we 've been really lucky when we did our as4544 certification for the site the australian standard certification one of the things that we do is we reuse our overs back through the system they were quite surprised because most facilities have a lot of contamination when you screen that out the contamination they need to be able to remove we actually just put it back through because it 's very rare that we do get the contamination through there so probably the hardest thing to pull out we 've had a couple of crowbars and things that have gone through the grinder it 's always not not pleasant but they 're probably the hardest things that we find and they 're not intentionally dumped a sales kiosk again fully unmanned someone can walk up push a button we can do the sale of the compost and then and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just some of the stuff on site there we 've got obviously landscaped very heavily when you go out there today it looks more like a race course than a dumping facility and that 's exactly how we want it to feel it needs to be nice when you come on site it doesn 't need to look like a rubbish dump we 've also got our um this one here is our intercom system so you can push the intercom you can speak to somebody on site it sends a text message to his phone he gets it on his on his watch and he 's able to then bring that number and talk to the person on that on there you 'll see there 's our screen that 's the screen that we 've got on site there and you 'll see that when you go out there today uh here 's the stats and this is one i pinched from bundy regional council but um 22 of food and kitchen scraps uh and 32 of garden and vegetable waste end up in our wheelie bins really want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and we all know the problems with that going into landfill so as much as this as we can provide we had so far this year we 've processed 11 500 tonne of green waste and we 've produced roughly around about 7 000 tonne of compost the little stats down the bottom there through our number plate recognition system we 're able to pick up the number of vehicles coming through it also gives us a bit of an idea of busier months and things like that you 'll notice april 's pretty high that was our construction period so we had contractors coming in and out so that didn 't really give us a good indication fully operational may june july as you 'd expect during those quieter months of the year where it 's a little bit sort of less growth going on not as much green waste coming through and then you can see as it slowly ramps up into your spring and summer months we 're starting to really push up and get that numbers through we 've had twenty four thousand um twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty two point two thousand of that is repeat visitors so it 's really good to know that once you come once they 'll keep coming back our products we produce out of the green waste we produce a mature compost a pasteurized mulch and a coarse mulch which is a compostable mulch the um the process basically is there we 'll explain a little bit more when you go on site today but effectively it 's 120 days from start to finish 15 days pasteurization to take out the weed seeds but you get the the product after 120 days environmental health check the really important part about it and this is probably the main motivation around is it does ease the strain on landfill it also boosts the soil biodiversity reduces the weeds through our pasturisation process so we don 't have that going out onto the farm and then we um minimise water evaporation so in addition to this it 's not the only thing that we use on the farm so we 've now transferred across from more of our hard hose irrigators to lateral type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product or the into their crop we don 't have a lot of runoff from the farm anymore so and and with the introduction of the compost we 're actually not using as much water because that moisture is being retained in the soil so more and more we 're starting to get a bit of a picture of what it 's doing in our farm the important part about it is though there 's no use us just sticking it on the farm and saying it 's great we actually need to start and test it so we 're working with different groups the university in town working through some of that monitoring process to actually get what is the results we 're getting out of this and that flows across to our water quality and recertification so we 're now hort 360 reef certified but part of the farm redevelopment that we 've been looking at is really focusing on where do we capture our runoff our farm is quite unique along the coast here we are less than a kilometer between us and the great barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban development you hit money 's creek and we 're straight out into the great barrier reef so really important that we monitor that and something that we really sort of take serious so we 've got a um a number of dams across the farm which take the sediment out and the tailings damn now down at the bottom obviously we did a lot of research around what we should do with that we put it into place to see how it would go and we haven 't had the big flush of rain yet but 20 mils not too long ago we were able to get a glass of water and put it on the other side and you couldn 't see the red soil coming out whereas previously that would flow straight across the road so and again it helps that we have the main ownership of those farms in that location so we 've been able to come up with a regional solution rather than the individual farmers trying to work out what they were going to do there so really really great thing that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today you 'll come out and have a look at it today really great part of the new business very exciting for us we use the compost ourselves in our own facility but we are now actually selling it out um we 've we 're producing that much of it and um and we 're starting to look at how we can really grow that part of the business but um from our point of view we 're hoping that this is a real real sort of kicker as we go along and makes makes our production a lot more effective as we move forward so thank you very much for your time today and hopefully we 'll see you all out this afternoon thank you so much nathan nathan freeman from green cells just a reminder to with our panel we 're going to have ray who we heard from earlier nathan and paul our next guest speaker if you do have any questions put them on slido now we 've got a couple of questions on there already but if you have any questions at all that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now so we 're ready to go then so our next guest speaker is paul woosley managing director from oraco group paul woolsey 's oraco group is australia 's largest manufacturer of sugarcane mulches the company provides sugar farmers with a complete service for what was an agricultural waste product and makes organic garden landscape and horticulture products paul started the business on the sunshine coast when complaints about dirty ash from cane fires prompted an idea of repurposing cane trash we know that too oraco group now operates a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility at childress the sugar rich area produces over 3 million tonnes a year the plant includes a composting facility with an annual capacity of more than 100 000 cubic meters of compost and a fully automated packing facility with an annual capacity of more than 10 million is that right paul 10 million loose fill bags and 5 million compressed bales of mulch products that is a lot of product paul woosley 's oracle group won ewys entrepreneur of the year program north queensland in 2015 and two years later woosley 's oraco group won the westpac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone for the sound of my voice um it was a big day at the melbourne cup yesterday um my favorite numbers four before i get into this i 'll tell you a little story my favorite number 's four um chris waller who 's a customer of ours drew barrier four so me being the big punter i am walked to the window and said i want four dollars on number four and they said each way or and and i said yeah each way that sounds good i didn 't know what i was talking about and they said that 's eight dollars i said no no to win then i just want to pay four dollars so the horse went on to win and um yeah that um chris waller uses hay growing right here in bundaberg so that was a great great outcome for the day um okay oracle where 's my clicker here we are we 're a privately owned company with um a hundred team members currently and we provide what we class as an end-to-end solution so we don 't um on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people like green seal start at the farm and take it all the way through to the end customer we originally we key product would be cane mulch um but we 're growing into a whole lot of other areas um animal feed and bedding garden products which we 've been in for a long time and industrial products all of those products we do we try and value add this is a photo of our composting site composting is great huge market for the for the end use for the end product but it 's very low value and it 's sort of where you send products when you finish with them so we try in this process to extract other products out of that material that we can use for more valuable more valuable products rather than just putting in a bag of compost um products we make from agricultural residues or primary crops of course we 've got our loosened that we get from green sil but we 've been doing a lot of work with sweet potato residue that sweet potato is used in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig food and we 're coming up with a product for for the cattle industry at the moment so we 've actually taken the two products one is a a real genuine by-product or waste waste product the other one 's a primary product we 've been we 've mixed them together we then put them through our dehydration system and these are the different products we get out of it so that 's that 's actually sweet potato infused with loosen and that product we 've got that currently on trials in feedlots um with pet barn and also in dog food the dog food industry is a massive user of the product they 're looking for starches and things that are in the sweet potato that they don 't want to use from a grain-based starch it 's turning something that was a waste into a very valuable resource um so other products we do when we value add we we 've got our kiln dried loosen as i said we 're supplying that to chris waller that will be a motto winner advertising very soon i can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't normally get we can do a complete feed in our bail again back to value adding that bale now we 've just invented the first one in the world that slices the bale inside the plastic so they can feed a day ration to their animal that they need it 's already pre-mixed so if they 're going to a show or anything like that it can all be pre-mixed and um they just have to cut around the outside of the package and they peel off the amount that they want to feed and they give it to their their bull their cow their horse or whatever and that comes in seven different sizes so they can peel a little bit off for their guinea pig so that 's something we 've developed in-house and it 's the first in the world with um when you 're trying to value-add and and get a competitive product in the marketplace you have to have automation if you don 't have automation to um make that product a reality you won 't be competitive on the world market and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the australian market so the level of automation we have is the highest level you can get we we do everything is is automatic in the in the system and um we have robots we have conventional stackers different products different equipment like that when i started the business back in 1997 we were struggling to make 200 bags a day 200 bags a day we now do 100 a minute that 's and if anyone 's coming on the tool they 'll see that this afternoon this is a new product that we 're we 're starting to experiment with with the growth of the macadamia industry in in the bundaberg area we 're processing or learning how to process the shell into into a meal and we 're now experimenting with different products on around that resource that 's going to be available in the area products from industrial waste this um material where we have a massive dehydration system on site and we 're dehydrating orange peel apple pumice both of these products go into the the pet food or the or the cattle industry and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise in australia it 's imported at the moment and the orange peel 's been done in south australia but not in queensland forestry residues this is a very interesting product for us in the local area we 've taken it to a different different level we we buy a lot of waste log they look like good logs to me but they 're they 're either out of spec or um a lot of these logs that are being processed in front of you were destined for china when chinese pulled out of the market we bought the log back off the forestry so we debarked the log we do anything with that wood material on site from chipping shredding grinding shaving so a lot of this log ends up in animal bedding for shavings so we shave that log ourself we collect the residue from the from the fields and we process it as i said into any one of those forms packaging for us is is a a key critical thing we have seven different bale sizes we have five or six different bag sizes um and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local domestic retail stores um again value-adding end-to-end solution a lot of our oversized products were spreading around around the tree crops in the area um and when it 's a mulch composted mulch that we 've extracted a lot of the other materials out that we want for our premium potting mixes and different products like that um again they 're some of our premium premium potty mixers um last year we did 27 million bags or bales on site there so a lot automation um this equipment here um smart technology it 's a robot in a box it does a really neat job anyone that comes to site that 's interested i can explain it in more detail in more detail this afternoon so we look forward to seeing you this afternoon hopefully everyone 's coming on the tour thank you so much paul if you can stay here um and ray if we can have you up please and also nathan if you do have any questions please go on to slido now put your question in for these three gentlemen and um ben arthur council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good so please make them very welcome oh thank you trisha and so i 'll be facilitating a panel discussion for the next 15 minutes before we hop on to the buses and get out to some of the site tours which i think will be exciting but i 've got a few questions here that have come through on slide do which i 'll go through first this first one 's from anonymous so if you 're here anonymous don 't put your hand up because you won 't remain anonymous the question is is the reality that industry must make decisions to achieve sustainability that that may not be economical is that true that you 've got to make decisions business decisions every day that may not be economical i guess in the short term for a longer term gain or you know opportunity to grow your business is there truth in that statement from any of the companies here today ben i 'll just kick that one off um so that obviously we 've put in a compost facility it 's a seven million dollar facility there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 've received for that and as you 'd appreciate as paul alluded to compost is not the most highly valued product out there so at the moment it costs us more to produce compost than what it actually does to um get a commercial benefit out of it but longer term as we get more better with our efficiency and we obviously get more products through and those sorts of things we can see that turning the other way but we 've had to bite the bullet and do it because it actually adds value to our rest of our operations within our business so we 're reducing the amount of fertilizer we 're using we 're definitely using less water um which means less electricity costs and hopefully more product at the end so it 's just one of those decisions we 've had to commercially make any of the others made sort of uneconomical decisions just sort of comment that um it 's sort of the same same sort of line as that efficiencies at scale so you can make a decision today because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the business we 've done that with what we do with the current wastewater out of our plant because we have plans for that and you 're basically taking a hit on that so that you retain that you know that that feedstock for something that later on you 're going to be able to do when you have a better scale better better you know efficiencies um more tonnage that makes it viable then so that 's one example i guess no there 's a question here around i guess a circle economy i know each of your businesses and individuals you know each other in some cases you work together you you help each other out sometimes with the thinking in the planning is there any i guess insights into the benefits of having i guess a group of you know similarly like-minded companies that are in the sort of the same space working together like do you learn off each other do you lean on each other are there benefits from trying to replicate the relationships that you guys already have in our region yeah of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're poor um and also isis sugar mill um and i know that i 've you know i 'm sort of late johnny come lately on this relationship but you know it 's just one of those ones that we 're building more and more and um you know i think there 's uh you know this discussion about um us becoming a a bit of a group as well um to address some of the you know the the common interests and common issues that we 're facing like electricity supply and that sort of thing but uh yeah yeah we we we do a lot together as a group um ray and i share a lot of information we work in closely with greenseal all the time and it 'd actually be great if we had a few more businesses in the area that were actually commercially involved in doing something in this space a good takeaway for today 's conference i think ben if i can just add to that too it 's important i think to think about things like obviously paul 's in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not competitors so we 've got totally different ways that we deal with our product what we do with it who we market it to so um i think that 's the important part is that there are so many people out there that won 't engage or won 't interact because oh that could be a competition or that that might be but i think it 's leveraging off that sort of stuff so there 's so many facets and so many different ways you can look at products and how we produce things and and that 's the beauty of all the sort of businesses we 're involved with is is that not one person has come up with a particular idea it 's i 've got this sort of idea and float that past somebody else and then all of a sudden that just grows from there and i think that 's the important part is that nobody 's out there sort of just making the ideas up there 's it starts with a seed and then it grows as soon as you start to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting a cluster or group together particularly in the children 's area or whether it is across the region would be great to sort of you know replicate and expand on the success you guys have had there 's a question here around the compost the market for compost how 's it going is it are you selling lots of it are you meeting your kpis or double below expectations we 're we 're we 're we 've got we 're producing more compost oh sorry we 're we 're selling more compost than we can produce at the moment so it 's and always the hardest part is the input so the amount of raw material that we get through the site is always going to be the limiting factor so the more raw material we can get the more compost we can make the more markets we can see but being such a fairly young business as well in that space i certainly know that there are so many market opportunities out there that we haven 't even looked at yet nor have we had the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current growth stage so yeah definitely there 's just one question here for you nathan around capacity uh do you have a limit to how much green waste you could take or is it so that pad can do 64 windrows and you roughly got a 200 to 250 tonne per windrow in there and we can turn that over every 120 days so it 's it 's probably more um the the limiting factor is actually the amount of raw material we get rather than how quickly we can turn it over we 'll take any overflow at all okay we 're actually looking um at a pitch to put to bundaberg council at the moment working with the two groups to to give the best result to council with the best return um shortest supply chain shortest transport distances and things like that so anything that nathan can 't handle will definitely handle that 's great one for you ray how important is the development of a regional circular economy for your business and industry like a broader growth of the the concept i think um that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as an organisation you know the the um you 're getting uh you know pulling that together again is it 's important but the some of the issues that are standing in front of us we talked about you know economics and stuff like that some of the decisions that we can make to close those loops are still going to got to come when we can reach certain points of efficiency um you know it 's uh i didn 't get to the last slide but or basically said stay alive and um you know it 's it 's really important to know where we 're going but it 's really important to make sure we can damn well get there right there 's a question here around infrastructure and training needs of of companies like yourself your own companies um what are the big issues around training i mean i know we 've got you know challenges around attracting people and talent but do we have the right mix of people for the growth of your your businesses over time i 'll start and um it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at nearly wanting basically uh close to 50 of our staff to to have a chemical engineering degree or something of that line um and uh that 's that 's obviously difficult to to get them process engineers was when i was talking to a chap earlier about you know the universities aren 't even offering that and uh so you know we 've got to look at um even um process control at a level two and a level four um i think it 's critical um you know some of the stuff paul 's doing there that a lot of that automation a lot of process work those sort of things automation getting people coming through at that you know what was a trade it 's almost a trade level um there 's something that should be looked at um some of those courses and those curriculums are out there but they 're not they 're not necessarily being been promoted or activated and i think that would be that would be really helpful um and the other one of course is we 're presenting and saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be talking to the colleges and and have access to you know those career days and stuff like that too um because even just across this group the diversity of roles and that might capture someone 's imagination keep them in the region or bring them into the region what about your business paul continuously running ads looking for people and it 's across from forklift operators all the way through to to automation technicians electricians anything it the the area is staff for resource at the moment and and i think it 's an issue that 's going to face every every business in the area when you 're a little bit um out of town from bundaberg which i call town when you 're at childers it 's even worse nobody wants to drive that 30 kilometers to get there and we 're offering incentives we 're offering everything but there 's a lot of jobs out there a lot of competition um we 're and we 're in the same boat as everybody else i think the important part too we look at and i think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people coming through now and having 31 different careers in their life and i think we 've had to change our thinking and and go from that thinking to we 're going to train somebody up and they 're going to be here for the next 10 years to actually know we 're probably just going to have this person and we 're going to capture them for a short period of time so we need to get as much of that knowledge into systems and processes that we can then move forward so we really focus on that now is is that part of that process the other part as well is that you 're not always going to have the technical knowledge or that expertise in-house so it 's about sort of developing those strategic partnerships with different groups or organizations or universities or whoever it is to know that there 's a particular skill set out there that we don 't need to have in-house we can always get that from somewhere else as we need to there 's but we have the same problems with trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pack shed is very difficult because it is that high turnover and and at the moment one of the hardest problems we 've got is people trying to come to town and find somewhere to live so with accommodation being so difficult at the moment we 've just put on a new financial person but can 't move to bundaberg yet because they don 't have anywhere to actually go and live so there 's broader issues beyond our business that are um that are sort of hindering our recruitment i guess um subject to some of those issues where just get some reflections on each of the uh the panel around where you see your business as being in five ten years times what are the big opportunities where you 'd like to see your enterprises go in the medium to sort of longer term in terms of the circular economy and and growth i guess um it scares me a little bit and i mean that in a good way if you 've ever spent five minutes with peter greensell you 'll certainly realize that he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business going to it it 's it 's it 's exciting it 's really exciting to see where it can grow and what it can do i love the opportunities that we have locally here and the partnerships are forming amongst all the different groups it 's it 's really exciting times and um like paul was just saying earlier with the um the haystack and hay feed side of the business and and and where you could market that too and i think the opportunities there are just endless and and i think that 's the benefit is that the more and more we build those strategic partnerships across all the different businesses i think the more all the businesses will grow and benefit from it so i really it 's hard to say where i see us house in five to ten years because i can 't see where we 're going to be in next 12 months so raymond yeah um we just yeah we want to obviously maximise what we 're doing up here at children 's and continue to get the most out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh another other words replicate what we 're doing elsewhere in australia and around the world for me it 's um trying to develop new products working with the universities universities if there 's any universities in the room that have got an idea we 've got a processing facility that can do anything with natural fiber anything at all we can we can segregate it into a hundred different particle sizes there 's a whole lot of things a whole lot of opportunities from bioplastics to all the way through to pharmaceutical products that we can make with the fibre that we handle we 're at the we 're at the very basic end of town and we we 'd need that support from universities in the area that can actually come up with these nano nano technologies or using cane fiber in in carbon batteries or or products like that you know a smarter product from what was classed as a as a waste material there should be no waste materials they 're residues at best but when when a byproduct becomes the primary product at what point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what we can make from it and that 's the area that we want ahead as an organization finding those new products in the marketplace but uh just a question there for paul a really good point you make there you say you 're at the the basic end and you 're looking for university expertise to help you you know i guess grow and it comes to the question about innovation it 's a bit of a buzzword innovation but what is it and i know you 've got some incredible stories previously to get your business to this point where you 've done some you know inverted commerce innovation um just by hand just by you know hard work and things lining up and you 've got some some great great success as a result that can you tell us some stories around how you 've addressed that that or taken advantage of innovation in your business to grow sure so we 're not when i look at a product that i look at two things the innovation behind it but is there a market for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a lot of people come to us and say hey we 've got this product we can sell it for ten thousand dollars a ton but they only want to produce one ton a year then to me that 's not a commercially viable product at all and and we can 't even commit team members to it to actually get that off the ground for one time a year so you need to look at what innovation you need you need to look at getting that product is there a market for it and how big is that market space as i said before the compost market that we 're in it 's a huge market but it is the you you send products there when you don 't want products anymore you don 't want to be in that space you want to be developing products from the resource that 's actually commercial commercial volumes and a really good return on investment because we live in a commercial world and we have to face that reality that it has to be profitable or no one will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product unless it is profitable so when when when we talk about innovation it 's coming up with a new product or a better way to do that product but then when when you 've what 's the market size what 's the potential return out there um can can it actually become a world-beating product and can we make it locally so we we look at resources all the time but we 're looking in the area here we we haven 't gone out of the area just because of the commercial restraints of of bringing a product in from anywhere else in australia so we 're looking at coming up with products from max shell from there 's a lot of work that 's gone into avocado seeds a lot of work they 're making straws out of them in mexico and different places like sharing that technology and bringing that innovation to bundaberg great raymond any stories of innovation from you all that 's what i was thinking about um we 've got a transfer bin that we that we built which um you know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and machinery that we 've brought in from various places around the world to you know and and a lot of those were designed specifically for us some weren 't like the chipper obviously things like that but that interface between the chipper and the plant and how do we control the feed to our plant on a continuous basis and give us a real real time understanding of what that flow is and so we built this transfer bin which is you know worked great from day one but it didn 't really have good storage um capabilities to just load it up so you could basically load it and walk away for an hour and know that it can you know the boys can go and have a coffee or whatever and the engineers came up with a um a system whereby just by placing some plates across the spin on a certain angle that causes the wood to always flow off and it doesn 't and it de-stresses the entire bin and um you know i just thought it was for a real minimum investment but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would before when you 'd load it up it would basically put immense force on the end of this bin and of course you would get inconsistencies in your feed rate and uh so they 've completely removed that issue and i thought it was a great bit of innovation great great example nathan anything um the one that comes to mind of recent we 're obviously part of the bundaberg ag tech precinct so we 're working closely with cq university and um one of the i suppose it 's it 's not only just new innovation it 's also improving or refining your current operation so one of the things that we we 've been working with at the university is a sweet potato that can basically look like a sweet potato feel like a sweet potato it 's got all these sensors all over it so we buried in the ground and as the sweet potato digger goes along it picks up this sweet potato that 's been buried into the ground and it rattles through our different processes and we 're able to then see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might just be in the digger that there 's a slight drop of an inch here which then bruises the spot on a particular side and then when it gets to the next stage it does this and does that so the whole way through the process from digging right through to putting it into a box we 're able to actually see what impact that sweet potato goes through to get to there so and again you 're talking about a small change there but we go from a 50 sweet potato to a dollar sweet potato and once you look at that across how many sweet potatoes we put through our packing facility a day and then a month and a year it 's such a change in the way we do our business and i think that 's it really um it 's not just new innovation it 's also how do we refine what we 're doing now and and do it better yeah some great examples i thought you 're going to say that going sweet potatoes have a come out and deep fried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not that good yet innovation for lunch which leads me to my next point um so thank you for the speakers for the pat on the time you 've given us um so that today if you your talks and um sharing through the panel so i 'm going to hand back to trish now who 's going to tell you what 's next off onto the side visits thank you can we please thank our panel and ben fantastic so thank you to those who have already um put things on the word cloud could we have that back thanks lockhee um so this is fantastic everyone who 's put things on if you 'd like to put something on there if you actually agree with one of the words type that one in and it will get even bigger so it 's a really great way for us to get some feedback on on how you 've found the day please continue that as you 'd like to so there 's going to be a small 10 minute break before boarding the bus to the site visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important thing you will not go hungry um and expect to back be back here at 5 p.m i really like to thank everyone who has made the bundaberg and wide bio economy conference such a success of course our partners bundaberg regional council brazil coast regional council gympie regional council and bundaberg department of state development infrastructure local government and planning really

the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country the first item of business is item b1 the confirmation of minutes so i now move that the minutes of the ordinary meeting of council held on the 22nd of february 2022 be taken as read and confirmed can i have a second please seconder is council mcphee all those in favour those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict of interest i have a meryl minute so good morning everybody today i would like to plead on behalf of our community that urgent action be taken to address the housing crisis last week i attended a board meeting of the australian local government association in canberra it was clear that most of the 537 council areas in australia are suffering serious issues related to housing affordability and supply in queensland the situation is critical low interest rates sharply rising property prices supply chain issues and labor shortages have been compounded by pandemic inspired immigration from the southern states bundaberg is not alone in facing this seismic shift but we are close to being the epicenter because of low and medium property values that are significantly less than the rest of the southeast queensland new arrivals attracted by our livability and lifestyle are occupying homes which are previously rented the consequences are enormous i heard with sadness a story of a young single woman with three children through no fault of her she was forced onto the casters card with a family breakdown she managed to hold things together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on time this young woman was strong proud self-sufficient and independent the house she rented was sold and she has been unable to find new accommodation the young mother and the children now occupy a one one room in a house with four other families her dignity has been stripped away and her well-being is now at serious risk on social media like other fellow councillors here we 've seen people offering up to three hundred dollars a week to rent a single room property inspections for the few remaining rental properties are attended by 60 perspective tenants or even more at times if you have a disability or don 't work full time forget it these people aren 't all on welfare many are working families with two incomes they can afford to pay higher prices to rent a home but they can 't find one many are living in caravans and in garages they are our friends and our families and colleagues the people we see in the shops and in the community they are also the invisible people because nobody sees their pain on the 17th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations wrote to the federal government and the federal opposition seeking a housing national housing summit the stakeholders included queensland farmers federation queensland resources council growcom saint vincent de paul racq and urban development institution most of us recognise it 's unacceptable that many of our fellow citizens are effectively homeless it should be a fundamental right in a modern society that everybody has a home it also undermines our capacity to grow as a community if businesses and service organizations are unable to recruit efficient staff because there is no housing for them how did the federal government to respond to this media reported the housing minister lashed out at queensland councils after they asked him to convene a national housing summit he blamed state governments and local councils despite the queensland government already committing 2.9 billion over four years for social housing which is expected to fund six thousand three hundred and sixty-five new homes i don 't have a single silver bullet or a magic wand and i wish i knew the answer the problems are twofold we need urgent we urgently need temporary accommodation to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet future demand these challenges are beyond the capacity of any one single council to resolve local government across queensland stands ready willing and able to play whatever part we need to and whatever we can the state and federal governments need to review their policy settings and work together with stakeholders and i believe there should be a national housing summit to achieve consensus much like bob hawk did with unions and businesses to reach an accord on prices and incomes in the 1980s we need unity not division hope instead of despair and vision over politics and i commend the proposed national housing summit to council and the community which is supported by all councils in queensland thank you ver fellow councillors and those uh here watching today for

Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",4847,welcome to the briefing for the march ordinary meeting i have an apology from the mayor who 's going to be traveling to canberra for the algae catch up no other apologies i 've got a couple of staff away there 's an lgma forum on today in bundaberg i 've got a couple of staff at that so go around at the table and just ask for any conflicts of interest please i 'll be declaring conflict of interest leaving the room in e1 and k1 e1 and k1 okay council bartels no counselor honors um okay thank you council mcphee nothing council of barnes council mclaughlin complex that 's what i haven 't done no council mitchell no conflicts you always have one come on no none today all right uh we 'll move on to the first item then which is uh e1 memorandum of understanding with uh rda widebay burnett ben i 'll be leaving for this as i 'm the chair of rda oh okay thank you mate and we 've got oh sorry we 've got a couple of people on teams right okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um a recommendation authorizing the ceo to enter enter into a memorandum of understanding with regional development australia why bay burnett in relation to the jobs bundaberg committee and jobs bundaberg councils will be aware that desperate the state government established a regional jobs committee late last year that 's funded by desmond who have contracted the rda to develop to deliver the action plan and outcomes under the regional jobs committee the regional jobs committee has a an action plan and a charter and that chart is very similar to one of council 's advocacy priorities the bundaberg jobs commitment the the regional jobs committee of jobs bundaberg is known 's job is to promote skimming training employment programs in our region to our businesses but it 's also to collect intelligence from our business and take that back to the state government for the purposes of further design refinement and funding of skilling training employment programs in our region so it kind of acts like a consul a consultative committee of industry representatives who advise the state government through this committee of training programs and pathways that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the jobs commitment crosses over a little bit in terms of objectives and what it 's aiming to achieve in terms of promoting skilling training programs in our region but also engaging disengaged cohorts in in in the labor market through training through the promotional marketing programs so the mauc seeks to leverage the work that the regional jobs committee is doing in support of what we 're doing under the bundaber jobs commitment through sharing some of the resources that have been funded by desert through the regional jobs committee and assisting us to expand the capacity of the bundaberg jobs commitment program in our region and the mou talks about where those areas of crossover are and how we can um share resources and deliver shared objectives of those two projects and organizations thanks ben comments or questions all right all good thank you um the next item 's f1 uh yes we will financial summary simon welcome 10 15 tomorrow um um the budget is around the non-capital protection currency much of that 's been profile um um as you can see in the graph the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was due to the delivery of the capital problem uh rates outstanding um particularly worth noting that we did resolve 15 properties to proceed under the uh landfills process all right we currently have six properties remaining on that list the auction should be necessary is scheduled to proceed next month and just another thing worth noting around debtors uh as advised previously um spur had provided that a range of debts that we had with him would be written off to about 30 000 that 's been processed and is reflected in the figures within the report any questions comments or questions council trevor uh simon you mentioned the fact that uh the capital spend is down i just don 't quite fully understand why some of the capital projects are running so late i i 'll give you examples would go toilet block upgrade the hall toilet block upgrade the roof on the cultural centre of children 's hospital why are they so late in the second half of the year cancer trevor i 'm not sure i 've taken a notice and come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you we 'll uh send an email out with those details with those projects that council reference okay next item is g1 and i 'll do this one given the fact that it 's fairly straightforward and christine is at that forum that i mentioned earlier so it 's the side of one of the last remaining lots in um heritage oaks in children 's and the recommendation is that uh council apply the exception under the government regulation for the disposal of lot 41 on sp21013 and that i 'll be authorised to enter into a contract of sale with the buyer in order that we can finalise that sale any questions or comments all right thank you very much i 'll consider that one done and then the lisa woodgate beach community bus scav welcome uh as the ceo said i 'm dealing with item g2 at least we 'll get community sync so um council has been made aware of the fact that there 's a community bus that operates at woodgate uh run by a community group right here provide transport uh they put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could build a shed to store the bus and some of the materials they have um council staff have a look around that area we 've got a portion of land on third avenue that is currently utilized for a small parks depot and also some local emergency services groups so ses and rural fire brigade occupy that portion the lease staff had a look at that and realized that they could probably excise a portion of that land that could be made available to the community bus inc group and so the proposal is that we would provide that portion of land at the community rate which is the discounted rate and effectively it would be up to the group to sort funding for shed um to in which they can then facilitate their request which is to build um some protection for the bus they operate so i 'm happy to take any questions i guess yes i was part of the at the time and we 're concerned about was potential encroachment on the proper boundary but i think nicole since addressed that and we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of that we effectively have to survey that portion thanks many other questions no very good thank you then we move on to the council policy review amy is that working um coming to you today with the council policy review so this is our biennial review of all council policies our policy owners have reviewed um around one of the policies and we 've made some general amendments across all policies including spelling and grammar reordering of definitions rephrasing of some sentences and paragraphs so we 've got no new policies for you today and the previous amendments have been workshopped with councillors previously there are some policies listed in the report which show some more detailed changes for you to consider but the recommendation today is to rescind the previous version of the 19 policies listed there and to re-adopt those changes amy comments questions queries council mitchell thank you um there is quite a suite of policies up for recommendation 19 in total i was wanting to put in a request that similar to what we do for our budget document where we vote on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote on individual policies so 19 recommendations yes but in the interests of keeping our meetings as short as possible the one particular policy i would like to ask that a separate recommendation be put forward is the media relations policy please i think that 's fine if you want to just identify specific ones to pull out yep so is there any other council on any other specific policy pulled out so we 'll have at this stage we 'll have two recommendations one general one and then all of them and then one specifically for media relations okay all right all good thanks amy um the vegara simp it 's an honest declared an interest but he 's going to stay in the room so that 's all good adam welcome in the hot seat i 'm here this morning to present the report on the bagara shoreline erosion management plan which we know as the bagara semp so the bagara coastline is quite unique and it 's got sections of sandy and rocky foreshores rocky outcrops pocket beaches and coastal structures we know the coastals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are highly valued by the community the bhagavad stamp provides council with a framework how to proactively plan for erosion management of the bagara coastline and enables the natural coastal processes to be maintained along the gara there 's a dominant northern sediment transport that means that sometimes there 's periods where there 's sediment deficiencies and it can lead to recession of that coastline the intent of the action in the senp is to develop viable erosion management strategies and to integrate those across the bagara shoreline uh maximizing social economic coast cultural and environmental benefits for the community the recommended management options for the four key sites identified are in the table one in the report public feedback and comment were sort on the draft there was a total of nine submissions received and reviewed in detail that resulted in no modifications to the final version of the semp so attached to the report is the bagar assemp itself and the engagement summary report for information so the recommendation is that council recommendation is the council adopt the bagara shoreline erosion management plan for and release it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um i just like to say that there was a lot of work went into this and congratulate duane and uh and his team for the the work they put into this over the last what two years i guess since it first kicked off and i think we 've got a you know professional document at the end of that um obviously with some um some issues that are still going to be addressed but at least they 're all out in the uh in the open so thanks i made one comment on it too councilman i try i 'd echo your words uh about the staff contribution to it and uh the openness of the consultation with the community i think by having these in place gives us a better handle on how to deal with these without having to go back to government all the time which allows us to move in a more timely manner when some of these issues come it also allows us to be able to go out and look for external funding with state and federal government which is a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite expensive as well so i also recommend the recommendation to council thanks council trevor any other comments questions no all good i 'll pass those comments back to staff thank you um okay we move into planning um request for extended completion date counselor honor and counselor trevor thank you top of everything at least or 10 o 'clock uh good morning councillors the report before you today is in relation to a request to extend the completion date uh for a building bundaberg region 2020 uh infrastructure agreement uh that relates to a development at 88 esplanade woodgate the development that was approved uh last year received the incentives um in march 21 was approved for the incentives in march 2021 as you 'll see from the report and the attachment which includes the request from the developer they have experienced considerable delays in trying to achieve a substantial commencement of the development primarily because of additional approvals other expert consultants that are in short supply due to the development boom and other covered related delays accordingly even though the precondition of the infrastructure agreement to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the developers taken substantial steps to progress uh the development that in this case an extension request to the requested data 6th of april 2023 is appropriate and is recommended to council for approval thanks michael uh comments or questions all good thank you um we 'll get the other councillors back in toy library sponsorship again which is under our partnerships and sponsorship program a request from ymca we have the disability resource center incorporating the toy library for some sponsorship so historically council has supplied ten thousand dollars in financial support um for operation of the tour library it was previously run by a community group uh that responsibility has transferred and ymca have taken over um the role of operating it both the disability resource center and the toilet door library so putting a request under our partnership and sponsorship grants program um what they 're seeking this financial year is twelve thousand dollars so an increase of two thousand dollars on what they 've previously done part of the reason for that is they 're proposing as part of what the services they provide is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond program which is obviously dealing and helping assist infants young babies and children in their development um so they 've requested twelve thousand dollars in this particular instance um haven 't indicated that that would be ongoing and simply uh the two thousand dollars is to assist with staff time and some resourcing and resources they would need to purchase to commence that program um and then the ten thousand dollars is their normal request to fund their moral annual operations so i 'm happy to take any questions if there are any um gavin did you say they didn 't indicate whether the best babies was an ongoing program i didn 't indicate whether they would be expecting that we would um fund an additional two thousand dollars again next year because their request was that they would purchase the resources which they expect they 'd be able to use ongoing yeah so um they haven 't sort of indicated that all of a sudden the ten thousand dollars has increased to twelve thousand dollars ongoing it 's just purely simply a one-off we understand additional two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um application that has wages um that are covered in there yeah um is that do we generally um wages and operational expenses under grant applications or is that specific for this partnership and sponsorship uh usually the grants we apply for we can 't put wages in some cases but under hours we don 't have a limitation um on that particular thing so yeah so it 's usually they just have to demonstrate what the costs are um and show us as you 've seen they 've even got some quotes there they 've supplied in support of that application but we don 't um usually annual wages for things we don 't usually do but if it 's a specific program we tend to fund that as eligible under the criteria yeah thank you thanks kevin uh any other queries questions nope okay we 're in queensland i 'm back um so next item counselors are one uh which is once again under our partnership sponsorship program a request from ryan queensland for some financial support of the queensland schools championship so the queensland rowing came and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to do is host for a multi-year event the queensland schools rowing championship out at bucker the intention is that they would conduct that in 22 and 23. and given it 's a pretty significant event on their own calendar schools one of the biggest participative groups in rowing and bring significant teams up here for that particular event so ryan queensland asked if council would be willing to support it and partner with them uh their initial request was for both a cash and an in-kind support so the cash request was for thousand five hundred dollars cash and the incline support was um to provide uh effectively portable amenities um also to pump out because they operate on a septic system out there and that 'll be a huge demand on that system as a result of having all the competitors there so we 've got some advice from our water services area about the costs of those particular things the septage charges and also i guess the risk that council would take if we provided the amenities and we looked at that as an option and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase that to 12 500 instead and that way it 's entirely up to the rowing group to look after the amenities and do that bit so we don 't have that obligation happy to take any questions if there are any and it 's for a two-year partnership yes the difference 5 000 difference gavin sorry that we 've it 's in the recommendation there um is that that 's made up of the approximate cost for the water services for the septic card is the 4 160 and is it um also approximate cost of what skip things will cost more the amenities so they 're after demandable and poor to lose and those sort of things which because they 're i guess many groups believe that council has those um you know sitting in park in depots and that we 've got them we don 't we actually hire them ourselves so we made them aware of the fact that you know it wasn 't really an incline support it was that would be a cash support anyway because we 'd have to purchase them from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinate that because we 're just a third step in the wheel we 'd have to organize logistics they know when their event on they know where they want them so we 'd just be passing the information on so we thought it might be simpler if we just give them the you know financial support so they can organize that themselves that 's right yeah so we look after the waste provide some waste bins and also undertake obviously the disposal of that material and collection thank you thanks kev uh any other questions on that one nope move on to bowls queensland i 'm r2 which is once again under our partnerships and sponsorships program requests from balls queensland for some financial support for the 2023 um uh juniors state juniors so they 're proposed to be held in january next year they 've requested five thousand dollars in financial support towards this event and the recommendation is that we would provide that so i 'm happy to take any questions if there are any thanks kev okay next item is r3 oh sorry it 's um i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um the fact that i exhibit at the show in three different sections it 's not related to the horses um i 've got budgies cooking and photography so do i need to declare that ceo thanks councillor hammerman um i i think it 's probably worth noting as a potential conflict but it certainly wouldn 't lead to you having to leave the room all right so i will um declare that and um at the meeting that uh will be intending to stay no i think it was the word smuggler was admitted thanks guys yes okay yes i think he counsels so um as i said item r3 which is once again under our partnership sponsored program so request from bundaberg apni society inc so i 'll refer to them as the bundenburg show society so they put on the annual show and historically council hasn 't provided financial support for the show but last year we did a once-off where we waived the higher fees for the venue so the bundaberg recreational precinct for the period of the show to assist the show given the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of covert as i had to make it a covert safe event there was could be additional costs associated with that also they expected that that might impact their numbers um and they took the risk i guess themselves to conduct a show where others had cancelled and so council decided to support that through a way or a fees last year they 've put in a request this year have made it clear that they have no expectation but they would ask and their proposal is that council could either do one of two things it could potentially provide ten thousand dollars in cash support and be recognized as a platinum sponsor um specifically for the queensland show jumping championships that they 'll be hosting this year at the show or alternatively uh once again as we did last year we could waive the higher fees for the venue which based on what staff have advised be in the order of about 9 300 um for the event alternatively if the council was in mind to provide some support but not to the same level they provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from platinum is gold which is two thousand dollars excluding gst so i 've put in recommendations in the report that council can either go with option one which is the platinum sponsorship at ten thousand or if they wish uh gold sponsorship at two thousand so happy to take any questions if there are i i has been around queensland some other shows cancelled because of the interest requirement that they say has come through the public health uh demands that shows and in reading through some of the stuff it does it doesn 't appear that you know you can do lots of things at the showgrounds but if it 's called an agricultural show there 's you know some onerous conditions is there any signs at all that some of those things may change prior to i think the show 's in may is it not that there may be some relaxation of any of those things by may so very good question council trevor the lgaq have been discussing that at length with queensland health because as you can appreciate um when the directive came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves have a showground that might only be a showground for three days a year and operates as many other things throughout the year so the chief health officer at the most recent um statewide walk up indicated that they are unlikely to change showgrounds because it has flown effects to other events and then they 'd be asked why they changed the rules of this one or not another one so however they have sort of said that the show grounds um because they are multiple use it 's the nature of the use so if it is a show it 's considered a ticket event so people must be double vaxxed to attend and they have to um the show society has to ensure that for everyone on entry but if other activities are undertaken at showgrounds that have been identified that are non-ticketed they don 't have to have that same requirement so they 've they 've loosened up i guess the definition of showgrounds to allow for the fact that they are multi-use facilities but they 've still got in place and there 's been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a show you 'll still be required to be double vaccinated to enter because it 's considered a ticket event [Music] um thanks kev any other questions or comments on that one no very good oh did we get a direction about your all one or two we 're going to leave it like that for the meeting well yeah that but i just thought if we can get it yeah there 'll be it 'll come up as it 'll go up as is yes unless i can get it i feel today for what might be has the option unless anyone 's vehemently opposed all right put the ten up and then if there 's an alternate motion you can go back to the two okay um we 've got a couple of items in um confidential so that 's was there any more late items than this no ben 's is being done it 's consultation race close rice go slice um so that 's right uh so councillors um this item is regarding uh bundaberg racecourse leases um i think there 's been various discussions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point now where we have an agreed document um but we need to tidy up a little bit one the resolution that was passed on at the meeting on the uh in february um just because it had mentioned five years from that date um and just because we 're trying to line the leases up and they 're assigned at different times between the two occupiers out at the beam park which is the greyhound racing club and also the bundaberg race club and so we 're trying to line those leases up given that they have common properties um as part of this and we also had to change one of the areas which was originally going to be a permit to occupy but at least the race club has requested it to be leased which is the marquee area where they put up their marquee and so we just had to the resolution for this particular one is to just to amend that recent resolution um to reflect now the request from the race club so that we can execute the agreement and also give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease for a five-year term have you take any questions if there are any fee um what used to happen with the monkey marquee was it uh there was the reason we 're going through this is there 's never been any tenure by either of the clubs okay yeah so we 're trying to tidy that up um and probably it 's been driven by the fact that racing queensland queensland-wide wanted to ensure that there was tenure for most race courses throughout queensland because when they 're doing capital investment um they want to ensure that they don 't the club don 't get kicked out then the following year because there 's nothing on paper to sort of say they 've got any tenure so that that was the driver for this whole process might remember it started two years ago now i think um and we finally got to this point now where i think all parties are happy with the outcome um and we just need to execute the docking because they already have got some capital improvements planned out there yeah thank you councilman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the runabout race club of our expectations on time frame for signing of the lease all right any other questions comments no thanks kev so that concludes the general part of the meeting then we 've got two items in confidential and then a short you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",1491,the myth operates in bundaberg by impact community services under contract to bundaberg regional council so the murph has been in operation for about 25 to 30 years it 's originally was a small shed that took in small quantities of product to be recycled growing to what it is now processing around about 8 000 tonne of product per annum with a recovery rate of about 82 percent of recycled goods so if we receive 8 000 tonne what we collect is that 82 that is actually sent to recycling the remainder is product that 's been contaminated or is not recyclable and unfortunately that goes through to the landfill section of the business the start of the process is thunderberg regional council collect your yellow top bin from your house those products are a product that 's clean lids off not packed up in plastic bags things like cans aluminium cans soft drink bottles milk bottles and if possible give them a rinse out take the lid off and put them in loose if they 're bagged up we do not sort those or open those bags they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeats the purpose of of recycling they are then brought in those council curbside trucks through to the myth they 're received in the receiving area where the council driver has already gone over the council way bridge so we know exactly the weight of the product coming in so each truck traditionally sits around four to five ton of recycled product it comes in to the merc it backs up and rear unloads onto the belts each load is recorded so we know exactly when what truck number registration is received into the nerf and the volume of product that comes in so once the product is received into the receiving area then is fed through to the first belt that comes into the murf that belt is a gravity belt that climbs into the nerf operation and all of the product that comes in goes through this first point the first sort station has two supported employees that carry out the sorting and the removal of large items particularly metal large metal items that you may have placed in the bin these large items can get caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder of the product then is fed through into our troller the trommel is the large rotating tunnel that have holes in the metal um tube which rate from 100 millimeters through to about 15 millimeters the product rotates around there and drops through so broken bottles broken glass those types of products drop out and then collected onto a belt underneath and they are then pushed out to a glass fines bin and we get that sent through to brisbane to a company called envirosands who turn that broken glass into mediums such as filter mediums road-based mediums things that are used in every everyday commercial businesses so the products that then exit the trommel fall onto what we call a bounce belt and the bounce belt is effectively sorting the light product and the heavier product the light product being the paper and cardboard that you put in your recycle bin and that 's pushed off onto a separate belt and goes up to our sorting line what we do there is we have four staff members that select any contaminants of that paper so why be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that aren 't either paper or cardboard they get taken off and get sent back through the murf operation the paper commons as we call it and the cardboard is then carried by automated belt into an automatic baler a very large baller that bails up the cardboard and paid the commons into 750 kilo bales that is a continuous operation they 're picked up by forklift and transported to our storage area where we would store anything up to about 50 tonne of paper commons or cardboard in preparation for it to be collected to be taken to busy recycling at gibson island in brisbane the items that come off the bounce belt that are heavier are predominantly full bottles metal cans aluminium cans those types of products they then transport up into the mir factory where they go through a magnetic situation where it collects all the metal cans cans like dog cans cans of fruit predominantly steel cans they go off into a cage where they 're baled separately the remainder of products aluminium plastic and the remainder of the products go along a line in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive employees has a process that they select products that they 're on the station for being aluminium cans glass bottles one and two liter coke bottles smaller ones but also your large two liter milk bottles and things like that the remainder of products go through we 'll capture plastics so plastics are things like your dishwashing liquid bottles your fabric softeners that you may use in your washing of your clothes things like that so each item is selected for that picking station and they 're thrown into large cages in preparation for bailing so all of the products that have been then collected into the cages so like the steel cans aluminium cans those types of individual products they are then processed and bailed so they go on to a separate line a automated belt that feeds them into a large bowler because they are continually changing products that they bail they 're manual balanced they are not automated they would bail predominantly around about 15 to 20 tonne of product a day and those bars are then taken away from the the factory and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bw 's to go to brisbane sydney so the product that then passes by all of the sorters that is the leftover product that is predominantly no value waste product goes through a automated belt out into a large 30 metre skip bin and we collect that product and then that is taken directly to council landfill on a daily basis we weigh that product so that we know exactly what has been left out of our processes so what has come in versus what we 've collected and then what has gone to landfill we have a new process within the murf operation we collect 44 gallon drums from companies within the bundaberg region instead of sending those products to landfill we crush those drums we have two new drum crushing units and they effectively put a 44 gallon drum and crush it into a disc which then can be sent through to sims metal in waco and brisbane to be recycled into new metal products so there are a few things that we get at the merf that should not actually go into the recycling bin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not go into recycle bins they are recyclable but they are quite dangerous so if you 've got batteries that you want to recycle please take them directly to the council waste facilities and hand them into the battery recycling section of the council facility so we get some interesting things that occur in uh that we receive here at the material recovery facility things like live snakes recently we 've had a very large python who decided he 'd wanted to come on a trip to the murph and come up through the belt and when the boys went to pick it up were quite uh stunned that it was still alive and ready to have fun with them so we get some contaminated products here at the murf things that shouldn 't go in the bin so if you 're looking at items that are difficult for us to to handle and our staff to handle are things like baby nappies please don 't put your baby nappies into the recycle bin they go into your normal waste bin other items would be chemicals if you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in on the farm they don 't go into the recycling bin either they need to be taken into the council waste facility to the chemical section and the last and the most dangerous would be sharps so we would prefer that no one put any used needles or sharps into a recycled bin because our people have to pick up all of these items by hand and they don 't need to get any unexpected jabs so if you 're recycling at home remember recycle and recycle right [Music],"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

and those that are watching via live stream to this the ordinary meaning of council there is no apologies or absences from the meeting today we first start by acknowledgments and as a community and as a council we acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land and the elders past present and emerging we also acknowledge those australians who have given the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country i now invite pastor buckle to bring us invocation welcome pastor buckle good morning are we on i think we are um i i was excited today i came to find a car park i couldn 't find one so that means uh some people will be happy and some people won 't be happy after the meeting today so that 's exciting i 'm glad i 'm not a counsellor so uh you do need the blessing of god upon your lives and and i promise next month coming into december a little i 'll be a little bit nicer but today let 's look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing will eventually be brought into light it also tells him mostly when we try to hide things it 's because there 's something wrong or we 're afraid of the consequences of even the truth being made known the bible 's actually a little bit blunter than that it says people keep things in the dark because their deeds are evil each year we make available to our church family and members the full copy of our audit through finding now even though only a financial statement 's required we do that because churches often get accused about their financial dealings it costs us more but by being transparent it removes almost all questioning and protects our integrity a lot of churches do this well so when we get accused it actually shows the attitude of the accuser and not the person they 're accusing current affairs a couple of times tried to find financial mismanagement with hillsong spent a lot of time a lot of energy and regardless of your view of the church they found three or four disgruntled people out of 150 000 and failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of transparency with integrity is a protector even a royal commission found nothing worthy of any legal action we have sadly also seen situations in the past when information that was hidden has become exposed and the damage that it causes we 've seen it so many places financial institutions real estate churches charities businesses and government no area is immune because people are involved and they 'll always be people who will if they can do the wrong thing whether intentionally or unintentionally that just increases the importance for us of transparency with integrity not only as individuals but also as a corporate culture this simple but powerful reality should always be in our thinking in every decision integrity and transparency are necessary if we 're going to strengthen community and build trust i believe it should be the heart of every leader it should be in the culture of every organization especially in charities churches community services and governments at all levels i believe it generally is in most of our country but they 're always going to be those who don 't do it we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't carry transparency with integrity let me pray heavenly father i pray for this council i thank you for them these men and women who do the best they can for what they believe is right for our community give them wisdom let them walk in integrity and transparency let them be seen to be men and women of character and of courage give them wisdom i pray in jesus name amen amen thank you uh pastor buckle uh the first uh items is obviously uh business it 's a confirmation of minutes so i now move that the minutes of the ordinary meeting held on the 29th of october 2021 be taken as reading confirmed can i have a second to please second that is councillor lermont all those in favour those against so moved uh the next items is item c 's declaration of conflicts of interest and i now invite councillors declare any conflict of interest in any items discussed at today 's meeting i know a number of already filled in the forms as procedures beforehand so i call councillor trevor thank you very much mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act 2009 i wish to inform the meeting that i have a declarable conflict of interest the nature of the conflict of interest is in p1 the reason i declare this contract is because orecko is mentioned as a part of the report the nature of the relationship is that my family business has previously done some contract work on their farm which we no longer do however i will declare this conflict of interest and perceive conversations and leave the room thank you councillor trevor as council traveler has identified a conflict in relation to item p1 and has chosen to leave the room there is no matter no need to vote in relation that matter the next item to have papers put forward is councillor mitchell pursuant to section 150 eq of the local government act i wish to inform the meeting that i have a declarable conflict of interest in the mata h1 specialised supplier agreement with dennis with bundy star truck and machinery for ivarko and dennis eagle parts service and repairs the nature of the declarable interest is that my husband dale mitchell is employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this declarable conflict of interest i believe i can participate in the decision on the matter in the public 's interest and wish to remain in the room thanks councillor mitchell so pursued the section uh 150 eq the act council has been formed of a declarable conflict of interest and councillor mitchell has stated that she believes that she can participate and vote on the matter the other councils must decide whether councilman mitchell may participate in a decision about the matter including voting on the matter or must leave the meeting stay away which a the the other councillors uh put forward the decision made on the matter so can i please have a show of hands today 's council determined that council mitchell may participate in the the meet including vote on the matter that 's unanimous so now the council has determined that councillor mitchell is able to stay remain in the meeting and vote on the matter thanks councilman now i 'll just go around the room councillor trevor has brought forward councillor bartals councillor honor council mcphee council barnes mclaughlin councillor haberman cooper mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for myself no conflicts so i finished with the conflicts the the next item of business uh goes into the the general running of the meeting prior to that i have a mayoral minute the mayoral meeting so good morning my fellow councillors and and those in the gallery the issue of vaccine mandates has been topical in our community i 'd like to congratulate everybody who has been vaccinated it 's because of your efforts and the efforts of everyone in the community that state borders will actually open on the 17th of december and restrictions will be eased on monday this monday 20 sorry 79 of queenslanders were fully vaccinated in new south wales the figure was 92 and we 're not going to let new south wales win this one okay so if you haven 't been vaccinated talk to your gp and please get vaccinated it 's our ticket to seeing loved ones in the state opening up the tourism industry and keeping people safe here in our beautiful community of bundaberg i know that some people have legitimate concerns about vaccine mandates and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the premier we were the actual first council in queensland to do this in my letter i said the government should release a road map soon showing a return to normal living and without segregation as far as safe and possible i tabled the correspondence to include in with this minutes the local government association of queensland surveyed all 77 councils in the state and passed on our collective voice to the government the government responded that council venues such as libraries and galleries will be excluded from vaccine mandates at this time the deputy premier also heeded concerns the businesses would be responsible for enforcement saying that this is not the case police will have the responsibility councillors have received dozens of emails in relation to vaccine mandates i want to be very clear that council is not the decision maker public health directions are the responsibility of the state government and as chair of the local disaster management group i have an obligation to support queensland health and police in managing this pandemic response and keeping everybody safe within our community i 've also heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unvaccinated people pose a risk to their safety public health orders could potentially be overridden by the federal government however a motion in the senate recently to do this only had five votes in favour the federal government has already started vaccine mandates in aged care and in child care to protect vulnerable people the code threat is not over and as we 've seen just recently with a new variant certainly closing international borders we 're going to need booster shots and the federal government needs to work with the states to make sure we have an adequate supply of vaccine going forward local government and i 'll say this has no decision-making role nor should we we 're not experts in public health i 'm aware there 's an active facebook group with more than 7 500 followers from across wide bay and the gladstone region despite organizers talking about respect in that group i 've been called a parasite a liar gutless and corrupt one speaker stood up at a rally on saturday and told the crowd there have been almost 700 people who have died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speaker talked about quote those who have been murdered by this government unquote that 's an absolute disgrace and totally irresponsible from the official record the tga has found nine reports of deaths that would liken linked to immunization from 682 reports received and reviewed unquote that 's from 38.5 million doses that have been administered so far 38 and a half million i 'm concerned that misinformation is preventing people or even getting hesitation for people from getting the vaccine and putting lives at risk i also don 't want to see the australian flag treated with disrespect and flown upside down like it was recently in rallies here in bundaberg and on saturday i don 't want to hear the rsl being attacked and accused of letting veterans down like it was the week before organisers of this movement should condemn lies and misinformation they should focus their lobbying on decision makers they should condemn the insults and threats that some people are making towards others the sooner we achieve 90 percent double vaccination the more normal our society will will be i was the first elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when that milestone is achieved misguided protests are slowing down the vaccine rollout and ironically causing the problems for the business owners that claim to support it my recommendation to everybody is follow the medical advice that 's my meryl minute for uh for this meeting mr man councillor trevor mr mayor i 'd like to move that this council endorsed the mayor 's letter to the premier on vaccine mandates calling for an end to segregation when it 's safe to do so thanks uh councillor trevor seconded counsellor bartel now before asking people to speak in relation to this i 'll go back to the the original uh declarations of conflict in relation to the mayoral minute and the motion that has been put forward by councillor trevor is any conflict councillor trevor counselor bartels council honor council mcphee um have we got any conflicts in what sorry in relation to the motion moving forward no who would have a conflict in relation to that i 'm asking you have you got any conflicts in relation to the motion put forward no i don 't have any conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for queensland health mental conflict yeah oh i think it 's pretty broad in its nature my advice mr would be that that 's not a position where you 're in any sort of position making policy or directives it 's it 's implementing the government 's rules so i would not think that 's a conflict advice but councilman councillor haberman council cooper anderson mitchell and cancel them on that so i now ask minutes any speakers in relation to that matter can i i just ask a question can we have the motion up on because i wasn 't aware that we were going to be this motion is going to be moved up on there just so i can see it because i just want to read it because i had no idea that this was happening so so did anyone have any idea that it was happening do you want to you know proceed as counsellors well the mayoral minutes being put forward emotion has been put forward and we 're dealing about the notion that 's put forward thank you so uh i 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another copy of them it 's probably easier to talk about there they can just type it in have you got it okay he 's going up there now so that 's your motion council trevor seconded and the motion there is council endorses the mayor 's letter to the premier on vaccine mandates calling for an end to segregation when it 's safe to do so any speakers in relation to that motion councilman can i speak thank you um i spoke to the whole to the full council about this to um plead with everyone that we could all actually um work out together a motion that we could put forward that we could pass to write to the to write to the premier um and i accepted everyone 's opinion that we should wait and hear back from the letter from the premier because i had no support to for that and i accepted that and now we 've been given this motion which i don 't disagree with i think we do need to call for an end to segregation but i just wanted to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay any other speakers in relation to this matter council barnes mr mayor i 'd like to remove a procedural motion that we set aside standing orders given the controversial nature of this so that um individual councillors can get away from the for and against and just give their thoughts on yeah that 's why i 'm going around the room in relation to speaking in relation to the motion yeah but while standing orders remain you get one four one against for a motion that 's on the floor so set the side stand in order to be until we can go around the room and well that 's that 's exactly what i 'm i 'm doing now he 's going going around the room so do you want me to start it inside and go around the room but that 's contrary to standing orders that 's why that 's what i 'm trying to help mr mayor set aside standing orders so that so that we dotting the eyes and crossing the tees yeah i 'm happy to get a bit of guidance on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying you 're going to have for and against but if council mars wants to formalize it by way of procedural motion um and it 's been moved and seconded so it 's been moved a second sorry the procedural motion 's been moved and segmented yeah so that 's right so uh our council so i 'll just put them back that the essential procedural mission that all the councillors get the opportunity to speak on it what i was going to avail because of the type of motion so is it 's moved by council bound sector council mcphee always in favor days against so moved now we 'll go around the table thanks counselor trevor mr mayor i 'll just retain my right of um closing the debate thanks happy to listen to my public counselor 's comments yes mr mayor i fully agree with the responsible approach that you 've taken as our mayor uh in portraying to the public the importance of the council supporting the state government in any disaster outcomes that may come from further infections in our community due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control and as a council we have and i know personally i 've signed up to support the local government act to support my community to support the local government act and anything that i was to do or anyone that works under the rules of the local government act it is really going against what we have pledged to do as councillors to go against a state government who has the health regulations they have the chief health officer and all the support of the statistical information from not only in australia but from around the world that is not our role as a council it is not our role and we have to take the advice of the state and federal governments and i feel mr mayor that it is extremely responsible of you that you show the leadership that you are and i fully support uh your letter to the premier thank you honor councilman thank you um i was very happy that you wrote to the premier um i think it 's great it was we i came and spoke to you personally about that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something to voice um the opinions of our residents in our region i 've only been doing this job for two years and in that time we 've had a few topical items that have happened i 've never received anywhere near the number of emails from residents you know it 's close to 200 emails now and they 're they 're not emails that i went out and asked for they 're just emails that got sent to me unsolicited and i believe that we needed to do something to voice the opinions of those emails and until i saw other councils move a motion to write to the premier i didn 't realize that i didn 't think there was anything that us as a council could do because i very i understand very well that we don 't make the rules um and we we 're not that 's not our job but i do believe that we can voice the opinion of our residents and that was what i wanted for us to do together and collectively so i i have no i don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to segregation um i i just i don 't believe that people should be denied employment or denied social interaction based on their health status and that 's my personal belief and like i keep getting told i 'm entitled to my personal belief and i think it 's a i just i 've we went to we went to um a citizenship uh ceremony recently and i stand up when the mayor leads us with the pledge at the end of the um ceremony and it 's one of my favorite things that i 've been able to participate in um since coming to council and we stand up there and we take the pledge um and it says you know i pledge my loyalty i 've googled it so that i can get it right i pledge my loyalty to australia and it 's people whose democratic beliefs i share and whose rights and liberties i respect and i this vaccine mandate um it it takes away our rights and liberties and i anyway that 's that 's what i would like to say thank you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over surgery um mr may i 've been hearing um comments of uh that we 're taking away choices for people well sorry the state government 's taking away choices for people and all that 's that 's not really the case okay says that with every choice that any one of us makes couples consequence and and we 've got to be very careful on how we look at this i 've been trying to look at this from every single possible angle i can i 've read where apparently somebody got a vaccine and turned gay a couple of days later but then i 've heard some very heart-wrenching stories from people and and one in particular was from a submitter from children 's in relation to a restaurant and um that really pulled on the heartstrings it really is very very hard i don 't think the um the mandates have got a snowflakes chance in hell i 'm actually working i don 't know how you expect a fast food chain to have a 15 year old approach someone demand to see their passport that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would be police the police like me last thing they want to do is run around on top of their work that they 're doing now and walk into restaurants or businesses and and you know start to get involved in this sort of level i 've also tried to draw analogies i 've looked at the stance i took on force fluid light fluoridation um that came up some years ago um but that was because the prospect was that we were going to put a chemical into a water supply for everybody else it had nothing to do with um contamination or you know what 's what i 'm waiting for of yeah of contaminating somebody else then i also looked at the um legislation that was introduced in relation to smoking smoking in restaurants smoking in buildings smoking in places of work smoking the um playgrounds and so on and so forth and whilst there was some opposition to that i think most people understood that the responsibility for every one of us to do what we can to ensure the safety of our neighbor this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've you 've worded it mr mayor um tries to cover everything i think what we 're saying is we don 't like this but at the end of the day our prime responsibility is for the health of someone so we 're not pushing um one side of the argument if people don 't want to get the the jabs then so be it i support your plea for them to do so that 's a matter of personal choice um it 's been extremely hard and the flag 's gonna fly no matter which way we go on this i think at the end of the day uh public safety is gonna be number one um and comments in common sense is also could be that frankly i don 't think common sense is going to uh take too much of a precedence when we look at um people are demanding just see a certificate when somebody enters their place of business so it 's it 's a mess it really is a mess and i think that this council by taking a different stance perhaps to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an end to segregation is the way to go thank you mr mayor oh i support the motion put before us today and i commend the letter that you 've presented to the premier in regards to this i would like to see an end to the segregation and the discrimination that is about to occur i don 't believe that it 's anyone 's right to have have their medical views forced upon them but that 's my personal view i share similar views to tracy councillor mcphee so um but i would like to call on the public to bring in respect because there 's going to be some very upset business owners out there and i would hate to think that people agitating against this would create that agitation just for the sake of it i support this motion today mr mayor and thank you for your leadership in this very difficult issue um just a couple of queries on this the mayor or mayor 's letter to the premier of the vaccines is that the letter you 've just read out or is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter doesn 't actually call for an end to segregation when it 's safe to do so well i 'll give you a copy of the ladder i 've got the copy of the letter here in front of me i 'm certainly looking forward to hopefully you know end of segregation in again it 's a difficult process to work work towards but um you know we all i think we all want to see the end of segregation um when the words when it is safe to do so is leaving a little bit open-ended whether or not we need to consider other wording in that motion i 'll just put forward the clarification of the accounts the actual letter says in hoping the government will release a road map soon it 's one two three four paragraphs i 've got the letter in front of me yesterday well clarity roadmap soon showing a return to normal life and without segregation as far as safe and possible and that 's yeah the motion is is obviously referring to the letter okay i just need the clarification of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah but it is the meaning so yeah thank you um thank you mr mayor i think it 's my turn thank you mr mayor um thank you for your guidance and i appreciate uh uh the efforts and your time that you put into portraying uh the will of of uh of of us as a general group yet to be determined obviously but thank you very much uh certainly he 's got my support and and uh the continuation uh to keeping the community safe is probably our biggest priority and i totally understand that we have to work under the guidelines of the chief health officer as do the state and to all parts of the community so we will take that on board and look forward to the outcomes thank you good counselor thank you mr may i appreciate the swiftness at which you sent that letter off to the premiere and i 'm happy with that motion as well yes mr mayor look i really endorse what you 've said and my motion there the guy probably one of the senior you know age here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid i was knowing about it but i 'm glad i had it because smallpox is gone now i don 't want to be faced with the issue of getting covered so i 'm double vaccine i can 't wait to get the third one thank you so i 'll just i just wanted to yeah i just wanted to um say something else i just wanted to endorse what um councilman mclaughlin said and just call upon the public to stop with the the name calling and the um terrible talk that is out there on social media because it 's not helping it doesn 't um help to end this segregation is there um i don 't know the procedure so i 'll look for your guidance um here mr mayor is it possible to change that most motion to council endorses the mayor 's letter to the premier on vaccine mandates calling for an end to segregation i think the wording is basically aligned to being able to be safe to do so because otherwise that 's that 's why it 's in relation to the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um put forward a a uh mr mayor to be it would be an amendment yes so it 's up to the movement whether in secondary if they accept the revised wording otherwise the councillor mcfee will need to move an amendment get that second and then they 'll get voted on i 'm not prepared to alter it mr mayor because i believe when it 's safe to do so is the important part of the message that you know we don 't want to be going against health advice so now that goes back to counseling yes yeah in order to have consideration yeah so we 'd have to go back out of standard yes uh yes that 's a good point i 'll just check yeah yeah yes accounts accounts so council mcphee has foreshadowed an amendment but the debate on the on the motion hasn 't finished because council trevor still has the final right of reply we still the council trevor has his reply and then we 'll go to the vote and then the foreshadowed amendment can then be moved as an amendment yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary business so we 'll finish this one council down then go to standing orders and then go back to the she 's going to move to standing room yeah straight thank you very much mr mayor councillors when the mayor indicated he was going to move a merrill minute due to the concern out there in the general community across a broad range of people across business owners in my own small community that have approached me i thought it only fair rather than waiting to the december meeting for council to make an endorsement of the mayor 's letter to the premier of some weeks ago a letter that was sent before most councils had even moved to consider this matter i 'm fully vaxxed my wife 's fully vaxxed children grandchildren i believe in vaccination but i also believe in the right of others to have a choice that 's a democracy that i 've grown up under and i think it 's important that we respect others rights i hear the comments by council mclaughlin and mcphee about pleading with people who respect others opinions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying they 're being coerced to do things at the same time they 're threatening other people and conspiracy concerning sending eminent conservation to do things themselves you can 't have it both ways let 's respect one another this is a disease that has affected many right across not only this nation but across the world but i do understand the concern in our community and i think what we need to do is make sure the premier understands the mood in our community that we are supportive of the health act to protect protect the vulnerable i see the premier has announced further mandates with uh at uh workers at uh airports and teachers just this morning so i think in getting our message across to the premier the state government 's the one that makes the decisions on this what we 're doing is respecting our community and letting them know how many in our community feel that part we now have to move to council band you want to move that we go back to we 'll do kind of a second or second to council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move now pounce my feet so i would like so i don 't know what the proper procedure is here but i would like to move an amended motion is that what i 'm doing um i 'd like to move an amended motion that council endorses the mayor 's letter to the premier on vaccine mandates calling for an end to segregation a second of that motion secondary councilman mclaughlin uh i 'd like to speak in relation to that i don 't i don 't think i can um mr mayor i it 's a it 's a very emotional emotive topic and i we already live in a in a divided um community and vaccine mandates are going to are going to further segregate people in our community it 's going to cause a two-tiered society and i believe when it 's safe to do so that you know whoever is deeming it safe to do so that may never ever come because maybe we need to maybe they deem it safe to do so when we end up with zero covered cases um i i just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter that you wrote to the premier i thanked you for doing that um and i do think we should call for an end to segregation thank you thank you any other speakers for that mr mayor i 'd like to speak yeah i 'd like to speak against the amendment i think we have a responsibility to each and every one ourselves our community the vulnerable people in our community and would we be calling for the end of something if the chief health officer was saying no it 's not appropriate at the time i think we 've been guided right through this pandemic by chief health officers who have a lot more knowledge than what we do as individuals so i just think we need to be careful in saying would we end that in all cases we just mean open slather or are we going to respect the science and the health cheap health offices so i just think you 're leaving it too open-ended the other way whereas when it 's safe to do so i think makes it appropriate any other queries or questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment yeah i just had a question if that 's in order um this motion is endorsing that letter is that correct don 't just shake your head and say no is okay um are we just simply endorsing that letter which called for the end of segregation when it is safe to do so or are we moving a motion you know that something be done in addition to endorsing that letter just it 's a matter of clarity for the matter the clarity just to confirm what council trevor has spoken about before it 's in relation to making sure that it 's safe to do so we know we 've seen mandates 80 mandates 90 and what we 're doing is basically saying when safe to do so now as alluded by the presenter of this motion we are not the health experts we do not have all the information that is provided to the state and the federal government in relation to making these decisions going forward any other questions no i 'll put the matter to the vote for the amendment to the uh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councilman councilman all those against the matter uh is in the in the negative so we now go back to the original motion uh the original nation put forward by council trevor appeared on the screen secondly councillor bartel he 's always in favour raise against council mcfee so noted thank you councillors for addressing those matters we now go on to the the next item of business in the uh the meeting is that we 've done the declarations is strategic projects and economic development and this item e1 is in relation to the supply of hydrogen-powered garbage trucks and fuel i now knew the motion which is on the screen here before that pursuant to section 228 brackets three brackets a of the local government regulation 2012 council invites open public expressions of interest before inviting written tenders for the trial supply of hydrogen-powered garbage trucks and fuel the trial supply for hydrogen-powered garbage trucks and fuel within council 's fleet will be a new and innovative venture by council that will support the establishment of a local hydrogen supply chain integration of hydrogen into councils fleets will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untested and proven in commercialization application the proposal to stage to to stage procurement process will assist in reducing council 's risk by ensuring any rf shaped by market input that best meets council 's operational requirements the assessment criteria for the initial eoi will focus on suppliers who demonstrate technology and supply arrangements that meet requirements particularly around safety value for money and environmental responsibilities can have a secondary place second there is council mcphee basically it is a very uh long promotion in relation to this matter that complies with the regulations in the local government act and obviously this is reliant on a a grant coming from the other levels of government and it certainly is is that we we want to work towards has taken on board by my fellow councillors is that this will be a full length change from being able to have the hydrogen produced here in bundaberg pumped into the trucks that are then constructed here in bundaberg and then servicing the bundaberg community and bundaberg certainly is a leader in this approach we know this once again is another issue there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a first for any council not just council but other uh groups within australia and certainly put forward a good a good submission for uh for this particular uh grants application vandenberg also has alerted in the briefing meeting previously and brought forward has taken the initiatives of usage across all the councils across queensland to be able to advocate for those councils which was pay a pass at the state conference to make sure that councils that don 't have the funding for business cases and for applications are able to receive funding so that they 're they 're bigger for one of a better word uh or cousins or larger councils uh are certainly um you know that they are not disadvantaged in that process as well so i know uh any other speakers in relation to

brackets one in bracket c of the local government regulation 2012. given that the property has previously been offered for lease by tender but was not successful thanks uh councillor cooper any other councils we should raise any queries or speak against the motion no all those in favor those against so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trevor the recommendation is that council a enters into an arrangement bundy star truck machinery for the supply of parts servicing and repairs of eco and dennis eagle trucks without first inviting quotations or tenders section 235 b of the local government regulation 2012 and b this arrangement be made for initial periods for the first of december 2021 the 31st of october 2024 thanks councilman chairman cover second to please second news councillor honor councillors trevor do you wish to speak further in relation to the motion just shortly mr mayor the council has within its fleet five bucket items of ecco brand and three plant items of tennis eagle brand these items are serviced in house by council 's fleet services section which is made with specialized repairs being undertaken by the manufacturer 's authorised agent there 's the policy of fleet services to use genuine parts and factory authorised repairs to ensure quality the main warranty integrity a specialised supplier was approved and a contract ended with bundy star truck and machinery centre under t e n 0 4 6 0 in august 2020 this arrangement expired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it thanks uh cancer trevor any other council wish or any quake wish to raise any queries or speak against the instrumentation no favor plays against so move next items uh in relation to j-1 is a coastal surge that strategy i call councillor bart 's house thank you mr mayor mr mereth i sought your permission to break the recommendation into two separate motions with um that being recommendation one separate motion to recommendation two so i 'll put first recommendation one the council approves the bagara to ruby anna sewage diversion scheme as the preferred option to ensure continued servicing of the coastal growth second to that second is council mclaughlin uh any other councils wish to i 'd like to speak further in relation to uh recommendation part one yes mr mayor uh the background behind recommendation part one is that the coastal corridor between bagara and elliott heads has been experiencing strong population growth about 40 percent of bundaberg 's region 's growth occurs in this corridor there are approximately 2 861 existing properties between burnet heads to elliott heads that are currently serviced by on-site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by legarra wastewater treatment plant which has some capacity issues key drivers behind the coastal sewage strategy include servicing future growth reducing future environmental impacts utilizing recycled water as a resource transparent decision on servicing future growth and unsewed areas to ensure continued servicing the coastal growth corridor flow from berga wastewater treatment plant will need to be diverted to another treatment plant two options were considered diversion to the been treatment plant or rubiana wastewater treatment plant detail costs and non-cost assessments for both options include at the bergara to rubiano diversion offers the best value for money this option also aligns with council 's local government infrastructure plan benefits the bagara to rubiano diversion scheme include treatment at rubiana takes advantage of the economies of scale and avoids any short-term major treatment upgrades rubiano option also provides a reduction in effluent discharge from the garage wastewater treatment plant to coastal waters this option provides the most flexible and staged transfer of the pagoda wastewater treatment plant while allowing it to continue operating with minimal capital investment by producing class a recycled water the ruby and option has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mr smith thank you councilman any other councils wish to raise any queries or speak against the motion next part of the item j1 is recommendation part two i uh called councillor bartel thank you mr b recommendation part two of the coastal wastewater scheme is not commit to retrofitting a retrofitting program for current coastal unsewed properties another second of place the second is uh councillor lairmont uh council bartels who speak further in relation to motion yes mr the background behind this recommendation is the cost of sewer sewage to a new development is normally borne by the developer retrofitting of sewage to existing properties would require a contribution by property owners to cover the cost of both the sewer network and treatment plants the overall cost of retrofitting the 2861 properties between bernard heads and elliot heads which are existing properties with sewer is estimated to cost around 73 million dollars it 's considered that it would be cost prohibitive for council particularly as a currently no funding provisions from other levels of government for infrastructure of this type thank you mr thank you uh councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak against the nation councillor mclacha thank you mr mayor well i appreciate that this motion gives certainty to residents who are seeking to upgrade to sewer i still feel that we really need to be making a plan towards serving those unsold properties to pursue that in the future and i would hope that we continue to seek further funding from other levels of government as i can appreciate that this is a significant project thanks councilman mclaughlin any other councils mr speaker council trevor mr mayor i understand 73 million is a lot of money however those 2 861 properties aren 't going to go away and there are potential problems with effluent discharge down the track as systems get older i don 't think we should be closing the door completely i think we should be taking a further look at opportunities for state and federal government grants to see if we can leverage some opportunities to be able to look into sewing that in a period of time now that period of time might not be two or three years it could be over 15 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 73 million is only going to grow and grow and grow so i 'm not looking to commit this council with that summer money immediately what i 'm looking to do is leave the door open so that we can talk to our staff maybe look at cost sections of it that might be lower hanging fruit than others and look if we can leverage from state federal government grants to make that happen yep thanks again for trevor councillor barnes relations this recommendation not to commit to any retrofitting program for current current coastal unsewed properties is to give certainty to 2861 properties in that area for the last um since amalgamation 2008 to 2021 the last 13 years council has been stringing the properties along saying we might eventually sue you we 're to a point now where the existing on-site steering systems are failing and they need to know whether they 're going to get sewer in the not-too-distant future or whether they spend the capital and upgrade their on-site civic systems by doing this we 're saying to them we 've got no plans in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding sewer for these areas so they can go ahead and upgrade their on-site sewage systems and ensure their effluent that is charging on their properties and ultimately flows into the waterways it 's treated to a standard that is harmful is harmless and will not harm the environment and also also create a better outcome for our coastal areas clarifying technical matters in relation to the uh to the report thank you mr mayor um i can 't support um recommendation too it 's a do-nothing um recommendation we 've got people out there and when they 've purchased their properties they 've purchased them saving because they didn 't have um surge uh sorry access to council sewage system and um i fully recognize that and have done over many years but there comes a time where you read the body sorry having read the body of the report it shows that this area is the the growth area and i think it 's incumbent on us to to not close the door on those people it works out at about 25 and a half thousand dollars per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allocation or the declaration of declared sewerage areas over a number of years there are funding offset opportunities for council to engage in and we don 't know what 's going to come up from the feds or the um or the state government by way of grants i 've got a letter this morning and i 've had several of the recent days it 's the raw sewage backyards running down front yards running down the street running into the waterways and out onto the coastal reef system i support what um councilman mclaughlin and councillor um trevor said let 's not close the door on these people let 's try and find a way to make this happen it 's not gonna happen overnight the way that motion reads is basically that the door shut and um that 's where it 's going to stay for quite some time i also understand that there hasn 't been a lot of actual consultation with residents in some of these areas some may not want it um and i guess that if if i just put a twenty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for another fifteen years or either that 's why i 'm saying that you know we can stage the the declaration of sewage areas over a number of years i 'm sure that we 've got information there on hand that we can consider i understand the council has discussed this unfortunately due to health reasons um i haven 't been that involved in that part of it but i would certainly not like to see this go ahead i implore councillors to knock this one on the head or let it lie on the table thanks uh answer the barns before going that 's against before going to council or any other freaking relationship before no it 's it 's if you ought to see clarity you can yeah it 's not until it ends up rolling on but never mind yeah now i 'll probably council bartel will probably clarify that a little bit further but uh i think yeah just before the council of cells closes up i 'm happy to to speak generally uh in relation to those clarifications that you put forward uh so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one against now four is there anyone to speak for the matter no is there any other technical questions in relation to that technical questions yeah i 've got counsellor honor and then councillor having me uh yes mr mayor i 'm really concerned about this and what i want to know is we in previous uh council terms approved the rubiana plan at a large cost to council we did get some help from government for that my understanding of this is that it was developed to take into account all of the coastal existing residential blocks as well as you know part of a plan to harness all the effluent from the coastal areas and improve the environmental outcomes for the area and i 'm really concerned about that no i just want one some clarification in regards to the capacity of ruby on a plan and is that the case we built it for a purpose and that was to bring the coast onto um i 'll just i 'll just uh probably seek a bit of guidance here but so i 'm just getting back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the motion because if we 're going to surge those we could be here all all day i 'm concerned for the environment the environmental outcomes mr mayor the environmental outcomes i 'll just get some technicality through you mr ceo to to the general manager in charge so you 've got peace of mind yeah so i suppose uh mr mayor just to fork going ahead because i just want to reiterate again it is an extensive report and i 'll address that before going back to the mover and there 's a lot of stuff in there to satisfy those type of questions but for you sure to to respond to the question which my understanding was it was the question was does the rubiano treatment plan have capacity yes it does it was built to provide sufficient capacity to connect uh existing uh and and perceived future growth in the coastal area uh it also enabled us to close three existing treatment plants which have now been closed and it 'll provide full growth not only on the coastal area but in bundaberg but these the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars that is referred to in the report is in addition to the cost of completing the riviana treatment plan so it 's um it is an additional 73 million dollars i understand that 's not the subject of your question but just to clarify that uh that is an additional cost and you know i apologize i don 't know how to do it my question is instead of simply voting on that motion is there an amended motion that could be put toward um yeah um but in relation to the motion put before is there any questions in relation to the actual matter that 's before you not that exact motion all right so uh we 've done so i 'll just go back to council far talls to thank you thank you yeah absolutely address a few of those mr fellow councils um i commend you to support this recommendation the recommendation which is not to commit to any retrofitting program for current coastal unsewed properties to give the 2861 properties that have on-site sewage system certainty as to a way to move forward so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can have better discharge to the environment and create cleaner waterways and also have a more healthy environment around their properties instead of being strung along like they have been the last 13 years thinking they may get sewer so please um support this council doesn 't have any capacity to fund the 73 million dollars it was demonstrated in the hinckler regional deal that federal federal government isn 't interested in funding those sort of projects as it was put right down low on the list of priorities and when you go back to our ratepayers and our residents i 'm sure if we went to them and said we want you to cough up thirty thousand dollars to um sewer your property a lot of them wouldn 't have capacity either so this is to give them certainty they know then that they 're going to remain an on-site sewer area um not a sewage area and they will be able to upgrade their systems they 'll know what they can do with their properties and they won 't be living in limbo thank you thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on that but so i 'll just go the uh the matter to to the vote is then in relation to the motion put forward to battle he 's councillor bartel he 's always in favor uh he 's uh councillor bartel council mcphee council mclaughlin councillor cooper and councillor mitchell and councillor lairmont uh those against his councillor trevor councillor honor councillor barnes

waste opening hours to come into effect from 14 february 2022 as detailed in attachment to with the addition that children 's waste facility be open on sundays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest recommendation yeah yep another second to please second that is uh councillor cooper uh councilman glock can you speak further in relation to the motion yes thank you council previously adopted its waste management and resource recovery strategy 2017 to 2025 which had amongst its 28 its total 28 actions review the operations and continuation of low use waste facilities review and assess the opening days and hours of all waste management facilities review all waste types that will be accepted and processed at each waste facility as part of council 's waste and recycling services continuous improvement processes it has been identified that some of the facilities could have could have reduced opening hours and days this will bring them in to line with similar local government areas to better reflect the peak usage hours of each facility council 's waste facilities have seen a decrease in customers partly due to the establishment of local businesses focused on recycling of green waste concrete food and asphalt as a result of less customers the waste and recycling division experienced a 1.36 million dollar reduction in revenue compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still a 716 000 negative impact on council 's budget council has also explained sorry council has also expanded its waste collection in meadowvale avondale and south carolina this lessens the need for extended waste facility hours the proposed changes are modest sensible and have minimal impact on residents yet achieve savings that are needed i recommend support for this resolution thanks uh councilman glocken any other council we should raise any queries or speak against the motion i call just a clarifying um question thank you um the new the proposed hours for sunday at childers are going to be the same as the proposed hours for saturday not the current hours for saturday is that correct yeah thank you uh so any other queries or questions oh councillor barnes speak against mr may yep smith this continually comes back to council it seems like it 's death by a thousand cuts um i understand that we 'll be saving 420 i think was a thousand dollars people right across the region need access to to waste facilities you know as i think it was only i don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we reduced them before and i got a lot of negative feedback on it and now uh in in my patch i i guess down to quinaba they 're talking about taking a half an hour off in the morning half an hour off in the evening um i just can 't support it i what we have now is um we 're sort of pretty well stuck with but to knock these around again i think it 's not just confusing i just don 't think it 's the right thing that we should be doing thanks councillor barnes any other speakers or queries in relation to the motion are you finishing it off yep yeah i 'm just wanting to maybe uh add to that yeah thank you in relation to that of uh councillor barnes 's comments there are more technologies than ever before offered to communities in relation to recycling and more and more people are wanting to take up these options so it 's creating a less of a need for the waste facilities to be open so i just wanted to clarify that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the vote uh the council of travelers away he 's always in favour those against the bonds the matter is passed on the affirmative i 'll get council trevor return the next uh next item i 'll wait the council gentlemen comes back the the next item is s1 it 's a sold supplier arrangement and as birds on the screen there is no i now move that the the

2022,3vuoE3k1NJo,20220118,1241.919,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",2337,um well welcome to the bringing meeting for our uh ordinary council meeting for 2022 we have closed the meeting to the public but are live streaming given the current uh covert restrictions and thank you everybody for wearing masks but i 'll take mine off to talk so you can actually hear me uh can i go around the room firstly and have any conflicts of interest declared and in which item please mr mayor yeah thank you mr ceo uh obviously uh conflict in relation to t1 as per uh previous council meeting and it 'll be identified in the next council meeting coming up later this month yes mr ceo um i have a declarable conflict in regard to k1 in relation to open for development as i have an open development contract with council on a development with my company uh taj trial investment pu limited and i wish to leave the room council barns council mclaughlin no conflicts mitchell netflix council thank you very much and i neglected to put the apologies in for councillor trevor council mcphee and i think we have council cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on to the first item then which is the financial summary as of december simon welcome financial summary is at the 24th of december um just noting that the budget that was recently adopted by council last month is included within this report rates and utility charges you 'll note in the report that the water fund is below 50 that 's reflective of the water consumption for the first half of the year which was 40 of the overall expected for the year that is in line with um previous years where there 's ordinarily a higher usage in the second half of the year so we expect that the water consumption for the full year will be in line with the budget um this worth noting that um we expect at this stage that the land sales will exceed the budget amount we had a 560 000 in the budget this year we expect sales this year will exceed that in terms of recurrent expenditure there is a slight underspend at the half year however we expect that by 30 june that will be in line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly over budget we expect that will also align with some of the changes to the landfill hours taking effect in the latter half of the financial year capital expansion year to date is 30.6 million that 's of a total budget of 93.4 million dollars for capital spend on projects this year uh cash at uh reporting date was 146.5 million um that is higher than expected as outlined in the graph mainly due to the delivery of the capital program rates at reporting date 3.5 million which is three point nine percent um as i 've outlined previously um that is ahead of where we 've been um previously just noting that the issue date for the second uh half year levy is the second of february um so the team 's working on that now uh other debtors has been improvement in the sundry debtors over over 90 days we had 61 accounts at this time last year we 've only got 26 accounts at this stage totaling 81 000. uh borrowings at reporting dates uh 69.7 million just worth noting that we still um to submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debt policy um which at this stage will be 33.5 million dollars any questions thanks for having me what the situation is with those um sales for debt areas whether they 've been any movement in that or whether uh 15 properties um i think was the november or december meeting uh this stage we 've received to payment for six so we have nine still outstanding um on that list any other questions all good thank you the next items relate to land sales christine 's going to do those via teams yes yes christine good morning is of the local government regulation to the disposal of those lots and that the chief executive officer be authorized to enter into contracts for the sale of those properties with buyers and required to all items to finalize those sales if there 's any questions thanks christine any questions no all good thank you the next item is g2 which relates to the sale of lot one buxton road buxton so council 's the freehold owner of that lot and that property has previously been resolved to be sold given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was previously offered by sale by tender however that was not successful and councils now received an offer to purchase the lot which is for market value the recommendation is that council apply the exception contained in section 236 1ai of the local government regulation to the disposal and that the ceo be authorized to enter into a contract and finalize um that sale and just for councillors information um that will then have all of those parcels on buxton road under contract if there 's any questions oh all good uh the next item is item g3 which is in relation to lot 33 and 34 at the airport precinct council 's the freehold owner of the airport precinct and councils previously resolved to sell those lots as their surplus to council 's needs the lots were offered for sale by tinder which was not successful councils now received an offer to purchase those lots which are full market value therefore the recommendation is that council apply the exception contained in section 236 1ai of the local government regulation and that the ceo be authorized to enter into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items for those lots thanks christine comments or questions council bonds um yeah just uh for when this comes back to the ordinary meeting we just haven 't identified that these are not airside allotments it 's obviously the value of an airside allotment is going to be quite significantly high and also have implications for council as far as airside access goes uh yeah we can and i think we can confirm that under the current policy that any airside allotments can only be leased not sold by freehold uh and also by way of additional information we have a report coming to an upcoming consultation day about further development of some additional lots at the airport so that 'll be coming up in late january early february uh these two lots i think from memory uh have extended settlement terms christine of around six months i 'll just refer to nicole who 's online as well nicole if you can answer on those terms okay but yeah the short answer is uh no they 're not counsel dempsey yeah just do just to add to uh obviously the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed on several occasions here uh both from the economic team and consultations that anything to do with the airside block is to be leased if and then determination on the number the least and we purposely through the council here is which purchase strategic uh other blocks that are on the airport area as well to make sure we had some consistency as well so just to give you peace of mind council bones this is certainly not a retiree everyone around the room i wasn 't concerned that was the case it 's just a clarity in the report i think it 's a good idea to have it identified uh thanks mr mayor nicole can you just confirm those terms yeah just in relation to settlement of those airport lots uh they are due to settle in april okay terrific thank you and mr ceo would you like me to have the report amended potentially in the policy implications to state that in accordance with council 's policies these lots are not airside and therefore there 's no policy implications just to clarify councillor barnes 's request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ christine thank you we 'll do okay uh any other questions on those ones oh well good uh we 'll move on to the operational plan so this is item g4 so council it 's adopted uh the operational plan for this year at its special budget meeting in june 2021 in accordance with section 174 of the local government regulation the chief executive officer is required to present a report to council about council 's progress um at for implementing the annual operational plan at intervals of not more than three months the quarterly report provides a progress uh or process of monitoring and assessing council 's progress in meeting those goals of the corporate plan the report is uh attached with managers comments on the progress over the last three months and it 's recommended that the 2021-2022 operational plan for quarter 2 be received and noted by council thanks chris uh comments or questions council haven 't been i just complement the staff um you know there 's everything just about everything seems to be running better than schedule and the ones that do have you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation about those so just uh well done to the team uh thank you council haverman and that 's against a backdrop obviously of some uh operational issues brought on by covert and also by the fact that we 're going still going through quite a significant development in building boom any other comments or questions all right all good uh we 'll move on to uh supplier arrangement you gonna do that one item g5 is a specialized supplier arrangement uh request with am proprietary limited for ga cortex license agreement renewal ga cortex is the software product that delivers our geographic information system within council it 's used for the internal gtx and flood pool applications approximately 500 staff across your organization use as well as the external sorry external interactive mapping and flood gauge mapping applications uh council has been using this for about eight years and it would be cost cost ineffective to um to change to another system when the current system is functionally fit for purpose accordingly we present this report to council for consideration in entering into a specialised supplier arrangement the recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietary limited um for ga cortex essential software support and maintenance without first inviting written quotes pursuant to section 235b of the local government regulation 2012 and that this arrangement be for a period of three years thanks comments or questions good thank you and then we have an application for a opened for developer extension michael council honor is going to leave the room thank you it was a report before you today is a request for an extension of a completion date um contained in a bundaberg open for development 2016 incentive scheme infrastructure agreement um the request relates to a one and two lot subdivision uh at 360 bourbon street uh millbank um the incentives for which were originally approved in march 2018 to provide a 50 discount following execution of the agreement in june of 2018 there was a request to extend that uh completion date and that was extended to 31st december 2019 by the ceo as per the terms of the infrastructure agreement the applicant recently became aware in october last year after making contact with council about what was required to finalise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discount was no longer applicable the owner whose request is attached for your information basically points to the fact that he made queries about the validity of the development approval and found out that it was still current and assumed that the incentives were still current as well is his advice currently where the development 's at is the request to approve the planner subdivision which is the final step for council uh he has been lodged uh he is awaiting the further the submission of further information before all conditions can be deemed to be satisfied uh the infrastructure charges will also have to be paid prior to that councillors uh whilst it 's open to you to agree to the request the officer recommendation is that there is insufficient grounds to grant the extension as requested the applicant was aware that an extension request was required to be made to extend the completion date as evidenced by their earlier application in 2019 um and there 's been substantial time uh that 's lapsed uh since the expiry of both the bundaberg open for development incentive scheme and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that request be declined thank you michael i 'll just make one comment i find it hard to believe that the applicant 's argument that the incentive scheme is the only way in which they can make that project viable against the backdrop of what 's happening currently in real estate is a little questionable uh comments or questions all good thank you uh okay that 's all we have in general we have one item in confidential but a number of times was i declared a conflict uh can i just i 'll be leaving the meeting uh thank you council keeper i need to work some technology i want to can we close that means meeting to everybody bar christine or can we ask people that are on teams too except christina exit

agenda and they 'll be presented by christine item g1 is in relation to the order and risk management committee minutes the audit and risk committee met on the 7th of october 2021 and the minutes are attached for council 's information the recommendation is that the minutes of the audit and risk committee meeting held on 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is item g2 this is in regard to leases for the bundaberg race course councils will be aware that council is a trustee of the bundaberg race course which is at 20 maynard street in avenue heights the property has been used by the bundaberg greyhound racing club and the bundaberg race club for some time under an mou arrangement in line with council 's corporate plan to formalize tenure arrangements throughout the region it 's proposed that a lease be entered into between with the greyhound club and the race club the terms of the lease are for a five-year term with no options uh rent is proposed to be at the community rate with all other terms of the lease being on council 's standard terms it is proposed that council grants to the clubs a concession of 50 percent on um sewerage pedestal charges in each tenant 's lease area and um six thousand kilolitres of water per annum um given that it 's a disposal of property it 's proposed that the exception contained in section two three six one b two of the local government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that council apply the exception contained in section 2361b2 of the local government regulation uh number two that the chief executive officer be authorised to enter into a lease to the bundaberg greyhound racing club incorporated and a lease to the bundaberg race club incorporated for parts of the bundaberg race course for an initial term of five years part three pursuant to section one two two one of the local government regulation council grants the bundaberg greyhound racing club inc and the bundaberg race club incorporated 6 000 kilo liters of water per financial year each and free concession sorry consumption charges on the condition that the allowance be provided to one water meter and that the allowance be used only for water on the racecourse site and the club 's developed and implemented water efficiency management plan and for issuance section one two two one of the local government regulation council grants a 50 concession on sewage pedestal charges within the lease area any questions council mitchell sorry mcphee um is there a time that they 'll need to have that water management efficiency plan done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rachel some work now based on their previous water consumption uh with the intention to try to wind that back significantly so um and there 's some truck upgrade work that 's going to happen once this is done as well which might reduce their water consumption so they 've already done some work and we 're working with and we 've been providing some advice um via vendors facilities um but they 've also looked at the pipe sizes and the meter sizes as well so there 's a bit of work on little spear case of formalizing it into a document so thank you and just questions probably directed to gavin um the issues that they had with the construction of the new stables there um is there any impact on the lease as far as that goes all of those issues being resolved chair um separate item from this capital improvement so not really specific related to one of the things the only relationship between that and the lease is that um the things that are obtained from anyone who uses it um are retained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it um so i know our major projects staff have been out on site and met directly with them and are racing queensland just to talk through the issues and from our perspective they were built to a standard that the construction requirements were provided to us by racing queensland so um we believe that they 're compliant uh there might be this some concerns have been raised i think on behalf of a particular trainer but um we 're working through that we don 't think it 's going to be a a drop dead issue thank you the next item is item next item g3 is in relation to uh sale of part of native park to east bundaberg development 's proprietary limited as trustee council is the freehold owner of native park which is at 7 olsen street each east bunderberg council officers identified an encroachment of an adjoining land owners infrastructure onto that property council officers have been working with the adjoining land owner to remedy the breach and a way of remedying that breach is to negotiate the sale of a small portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the property with the encroachment is proposed to be subdivided off and sold to the adjoining owner for market value given that um it 's a sale to the adjoining owner the disposal exception contained in section 2361c4 is able to be applied under the local government regulation as it 's a sale to an adjoining owner given the size of the land um it 's probably not appropriate for it to go to tender given it 's a smaller size and that there 's no other adjoining owners that wish to acquire that property the recommendation is that council applied the exception contained in section 2361c4 of the local government regulation to the disposal of a portion of that property and that the ceo be authorised to enter into a contract of sale with the buyers and attend to all items to require to finalize that sale questions just get councillor mcphee back in the room uh the next item counselors is item g4 which is in relation to a sale of lot 9 on sp 311608 at the bundaberg regional aviation and aerospace precinct council is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to sell the lot as its surplus to council 's needs it was previously offered for tender councils now received um an offer on that lot to be purchased and it is for market uh value therefore the uh recommendation to council is that council applied the exception contained in section 2361a i of the local government regulation to the disposal of lot 9 and that the chief executive officer be authorised to enter into a contract of sale with the buyer and attend to all items required to finalize that sale questions thank you thanks christine councillors item h1 is a proposed renewal of an existing specialized supplier arrangement with dormer carver for maintenance of automatic doors throughout our facilities across the region it 's uh dulmacaba as a company that the the arrangement would be with but they provide the service via a local contractor the recommendation is that we enter into a specialised supply arrangement under section 235b of the local government regulation with the arrangement being in place for three years any questions moving on to development assessment item l1 good morning councillors uh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was presented to the december meeting so i won 't go over the details of the proposal again the change that has occurred since is that you 'll see as a final attachment to the report the applicant has submitted further information following his presentation at a consultation day and that material in summary tries to build further the case for support of the proposal uh highlighting the uh the need for the facility the impracticality of the uh 400 meter setback uh to adjoining residences and the fact that council have approved other facilities elsewhere uh and then um there 's a bit of going through some of the strategic framework elements of the planning scheme looking for elements that support uh the proposal having considered uh that material the officers agree that there is a need for this facility in this location but that the applicant hasn 't demonstrated that that need solely relates uh to this site and that the the need that 's demonstrated is uh in our view not sufficient to overcome the substantial uh conflicts with the the planning scheme not the least which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right next door to residential properties for the basis our recommendation remains unchanged and it 's recommended for refusal for the reasons detailed in the report thanks michael any questions counsellors thanks michael so the next section of the agenda is community and cultural services we 've got uh three lease matters that are going to be presented by christine im01

2021,SInuVlWaphI,20211221,4366.96,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",8483,and all those watching by our live stream for this the ordinary meeting of council there is no apologies uh for today 's meeting council acknowledges the traditional custodians of the land and which we meet here today the elders past present and emerging we also acknowledge those australians who have given the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country i now invite it 's good to see pastor buckle to bring his invocation good morning christmas exciting time of the year it 's also quite a it 's a mixed and i think that 's one of the great challenges of christmas for a lot of people and uh what i like about the christian faith especially is that hebrews tells you that jesus is has been touched with the feelings of our infirmities one of the reasons for a biblical point of view that god came is to walk among us to walk the feelings and the heartaches and the pains and the anguishes of our life to know hunger loss grief betrayal and in the midst of all that maintain joy and i think that 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so that in many happy christmas for those who don 't like that happy holidays happy season but uh i really believe that we have a faith that 's worth championing uh i went to lights last night i saw the one over just near uh the paradise lane or somewhere it 's beautiful city right so merry christmas and i thought well you know we need to realize this is our meaning for christ and many people don 't acknowledge that but i want to remember that there are jews and there are sorrows there are people in pain and there are people who are having great joy and i think as ministers one of the things that we remember and i encourage you as counselors to remember that if we don 't work in people 's shoes we don 't always know how they feel i think that 's why jesus came so that we could know that our god knows how we feel in every situation and we pray father i thank you for christmas a reminder that god came among us to know our heartaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not untouched by us the ways we travel the pains we have you 're not aloof and afar off you 're very near to those who call upon you that operate into christmas time will be a time of great joy for many and for those who are in grief let them find comfort and hope in the midst of the battles

young citizen of the year for 2022. isaac is an inspirational ambassador for swimming and a role model for up-and-coming sporting stars in our region swimming is just something that i 've always done i know that i started learning to swim i pretty much as soon as i could i think it was maybe four or five months in the water um by the time i was five i was actually starting score training i 've been swimming for a very long time but i 've i 've loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tokyo olympics to swim in the 100 backstroke and then just to make the semi-final and i managed to place 12th in the world in the semi-final 100 back i also was thankfully selected to be the heat swimmer of the 4 by 100 mixed medley relay where my team was able to pick up a bronze medal which was incredible to come away from my first international race the olympics for the bronze medal oh people always ask me like how was the olympic experience and it 's just there 's no words to describe it and even when i was there with people i was thinking to myself i wish that i wish that everyone could be here to witness this and see how incredible it is but i think that 's what makes it so special is that only a select few actually are able to go and so it was it was insane experience i still can 't describe it fantastic thank you thank you very much everyone for having me um i remember when i was called and i was told that i was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing that i thought about was back in 2017 was when i got my first australia day award and i believe then it was junior sporting spirit of the year award and i remember little 13 year old isaac i walked up on the stage and i was much too nervous to come up and talk in front of everyone and mr dempsey thankfully spoke on my behalf but i remember i was standing to the side and my legs were shaking and i was i was really nervous um and i like to think that that isaac little isaac is could look forward five years and be proud of the person that i 've become now and while i have moved away and i now live in brisbane i still come back regularly to bundaberg because this is my home and this is where i grew up this is where i learned how to swim i still have my old coaches here who took me to my first australian record uh my first australian gold medal national gold medal um and i wouldn 't be the person that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy coming back and coming back to this community so thank you very much for having me and thank you for this honor so wonderful isaac and when we welcomed isaac back from the olympics um last year it uh was such a thrill and i know he 's going to be such an ambassador for our region going forward in his career so our next award is the senior citizen of the year awarded to a valued resident who displays ongoing excellence in their field and in the community demonstrating leadership and innovation while contributing to the region and this year 's bundaberg region senior citizen of the year is judy girola judith giarola is bundaberg regional council 's senior citizen of the year for 2022. judith has been a driving force behind the moore park beach turtle monitoring group for 19 years as well as volunteering her time and efforts to get locals more physically active it is actually the 20th season for my partner vern cook and myself and yes it is for us our 20th season and it just seems to have flown during the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarding as well so i think it 's been 20 seasons well spent and the night crew when we 're patrolling depending on the number of teams that we have we can cover as much beach as possible and as often as possible so that we do have more chance of encountering a nesting turtle we regularly take do talks with the school although we haven 't this year but with the scouts group the scouts group realise the importance of our our turtles and they love to keep their scouts up to speed with what they should and they shouldn 't do on the beach well the classes are run once a week they are free it 's a stretch flexibility and balance class and all i ask is that i get a smile middle i had to have notes um i 'm quite dumbfounded thank you i 'm honored to receive the recognition allow humbled and somewhat dumbfounded when i think of the number of remarkable seniors doing amazing things in our communities they should all be applauded for their efforts the main purpose of the moorpark beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nests as possible and therefore get as many hatchlings as we can safely into the water in accepting this award i need to share it with our incredible team without each and every member we could not achieve our purpose in particular i acknowledge my partner vern cook who has worked alongside me as we have hurtled and turtle from season to season together i also need and want to thank lynne boschemer our right hand person who joined vern and i in our third season her efforts and commitment have been tireless and i cannot thank her enough the marine turtles on the east coast of australia need our help our loggerheads are endangered and our flatback and green sea turtles are vulnerable their plight has been caused predominantly by humans it is therefore up to all of us to help them while we may be moving nests to safer locations on moorpark beach or meshing to prevent predation or barricading to protect nests from four-wheel drives and motorbikes we can all do little things little things like collecting rubbish from the beach dimming lights or turning off unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not using bright torches on our beaches during the turtle season if a lot of people do little things big things can happen to the participants in my stretch flexibility and balance session i thank you for what we share friendship support when and if it is needed and the sheer joy of getting together our sessions are wonderful for our spirits as well as our bodies and it 's so important to maintain both as we age my mother and father were remarkable role models who gave freely of their time and energy to help others and causes in which they believed they made me who i am and i know they would have been proud of this recognition thank you wonderful judy and i know they are going to be celebrating at moore park beach today well our final award is citizen of the year this award recognises an inspirational role model who displays ongoing excellence in their field and in the community demonstrating leadership and innovation while contributing to the region this year 's bundaberg region citizen of the year is dale rethamel dale rethamel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made an invaluable contribution to our community through tireless volunteer work his generous support of a range of sporting and community groups and his fundraising efforts i love feeling connected and i love feeling a part of all the sporting groups and the community groups that we 're involved in it 's it 's it 's a great feeling you know i do it with pride and i i do it for passion and obviously i do it because you know bundaberg is just such a great town and um and i love helping to try and contribute to keep it that way if this it 's a small part that i can play as a business owner where i can give back to the community to help thunderbird prosper and be a great community and and that then in turn you know represents the value for business and makes business strong and and it 's just something that i love doing i 've been the president since 2018 of the bundaberg race club i 've formed some absolutely fantastic friendships that i 've had for life um you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love working extremely hard with them i was asked as a community member to join a joint committee between life flight and the rfds i jumped in boots and all and i 've never regretted a single moment they are just an amazing organisation i love going out to the base i love showing people the base i 'm incredibly passionate about it so if you just come forward is i 've been told to keep this uh short today so that 's why i thought i 'd actually refer to notes for probably once in my life because i do have a tendency to rub it on a little bit so um i was quite happy to hear that trish said i wasn 't able to hug there today but to everyone here what a fantastic honor i 'm normally not particularly short for words and i 'm normally in this position giving someone else an award or a presentation i love doing that it 's very rare for people to get recognized for what they do and i 'm very humbled for that i love australia and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bundaberg i just think we live in an amazing part of the world we have a fantastic climate we have brilliant people that live here around us uh we 're just so blessed to be part of a community that can just continually to give give give and punch well above its weight for the size of that we are as people may know or may not know i 'm heavily involved in sport all sorts of sports i think sports bring communities together sports are great for fitness great for general health and there 's nothing better than when large groups of the community come together young and old to enjoy each other 's company and it certainly builds the strong fabric that we have here in bundaberg i 'd like to thank the community and i 'd like to thank all those people that give to all the sporting organizations and all the community groups and all the community events that we hold here in bundaberg without people volunteering and without people donating these events just simply don 't occur so thank you so much for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize volunteers not only volunteers but also people that give and businesses that give because people do this out of the goodness of their own heart they do not have to give they do not have to volunteer time they do not get paid to do what they do they do that because they love the region that they live in or they love the organisation that they 're involved in so congratulations to every single person out there in bundaberg that makes this just such a fantastic place i 'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all the assistance that we get by federally state and from the local council we simply can 't run our sporting organizations and community group without that assistance through grants or through generous donations through council so thank you very much for that i won 't keep you this much longer because i could talk here all day about this but thank you to natalie and the kids they often don 't see me a lot so um but i love doing what i do and i 'd like to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awareness for all the amazing work that volunteers and people that donate to our community and how it makes bundaberg just such a special place to live thank you and happy australia today congratulations dale i understand he kept it a surprise from his family so

thanks um i believe i have a declarable confidence interest item t1 uh which is uh suspected in appropriate conduct shown to section 150 eq the local government act 2009 which informed the meeting that i have a declarable conflict of interest the nature of the conflict of interest that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years have a close working relationship with this person and classes person 's friend section 150 en of the local government act 2009 states that a declarable conflict of interest could reasonably reasonably be presumed to have and all the training that council have been subject to which has been provided by the oia lgaq and department of local government has always advised her on the side of caution and if if in doubt get out due to this it could be presumed that someone could reasonably think that my decision may be biased and due to this fact i may report it for not declaring a perceived conflict of interest and be investigated by the office independent assessment i do not want this to occur and therefore having stayed at this perceived conflict of interest i 'm going to leave the room and not vote on the matter thanks councillor tal um obviously uh councillor

fairly review or evaluate sorry councillor barnsteiner to start up just which item sorry item t1 t1 thanks councillor barnes if you want to start again i 'll go ahead whichever is easiest for you i haven 't been offered nor have i received any training which makes me feel confident to properly and fairly review or evaluate the strength or veracity of the evidence acquired by a third party investigator similarly i 've not been trained on how to determine what a fitting penalty if any would be appropriate under the circumstances i know that even if a penalty was to be in the nature of a slap on the wrist it would still have the potential to tarnish the integrity and reputation of a subject counsellor i did not run for election to stand in judgment of a fellow councillor within a political environment and do not accept that the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury for one of their duly elected representatives further given the above reasons i 'm not comfortable in being a party to this process and as such i believe that this creates a real conflict of interest for me are they therefore vacate the chamber during any related discussion will not take part in the vote thanks uh

external users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications that approximately 500 staff access and and for the external externally accessible interactive mapping for flood gauge mapping and applications that the public can utilize council has been utilizing this software for more than eight years and therefore it would be not be cost effective to change to another system when the existing system is still functioning fit and fit for purpose council officers suggest that the council apply the exception to tender requirements contained in section 235 in brackets b of the local government regulation 2012 as it would be impractical or disadvantageous for the council to invite quotes to timber thank you councillor cooper it 's been moved it 's been second any other council wish to raise any queries to

for these fees i didn 't read that i realized that i 'm asking um that is there in the background so should is that another recommendation that will come forward at a future time or should we be considering the recommendation that i read which is the part the mayor just explained which is thanks counselor cooper at all costs to be associated to be established of the new lease to be covered @

questions in relation to the recommendation that 's put forward today no i just uh obviously want to thank everybody involved it certainly is at a timely manner and for both the surf lifestyle saving club and council so it 'd be advantageous to be able to make this work as quick as possible considering this has been on surf life savings books for a number of decades now already so if when we 've done our master plan and if we uh we know we 'd covered and work and specialised supplies the the the quicker we can get these things up and running the the better it is and we 've always acted in

from him uh and he then come back and subsequently ask for an extension of time which is well past the uh the date for the for the incentive scheme which you 'll also recall is now six years old so uh the officers have assessed the com the um the request and based on the length of time since he was given that original approval and in our opinion not coming up with any legitimate reason to grant an

2021,iJJrfKPBEtQ,20211123,3686.48,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",4066,um in advance of the meeting next week so i might just go around the room might be the easiest way to do that start with you mr man council trevor thank you council mcphee mine 's t2 i 've got a declarable conflict but i am choosing to stay in the room oh sorry can you remind everybody to put their bikes on mine 's on um councillor barnes no councilman lachlan t2 and i 'll thank you very much okay um with the conflicts all declared we 'll move on to item e1 then councils will be aware of efforts by the council to position our region 's economy in the rapidly emerging hydrogen space uh the reasons for doing this are for economic diversification to create jobs in sustainable industries such as renewable energy and also to de-risk our our region in terms of the future decarbonisation of the region over time one way to do this is for cancer player leadership role in the trial of technology such as hydrogen technology and hydrogen fuel and vehicles within within our fleet um to do that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen in two of our garbage trucks is a troll operation to demonstrate how our region can use technology such as hydrogen hydrogen and fuel as a source of powering our operations in a in a lower carbon environment to do that requires council to approach the market to look at ways to look at suppliers that may be able to provide the technology and the fuel and the know-how to implement those changes into our fleet so today 's items about a procurement methodology a two-stage procurement methodology where we 'll be doing eoi will be going to the market to see information on what that might look like in terms of how we would operationalize hydrogen fuel and vehicles into our fleet um upon after that there may be a subsequent rft inviting uh suppliers of hydrogen fuel and vehicles into it into the operations fleet uh the recommendations today is that pursuant to section 2283 a of the local government regulations 2012 the council will invite opening public expressions of interest before inviting written tenders for the trial supply of hydrogen-powered garbage trucks and fuel the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet will be a new and innovative venture by council that will support the establishment of local hydrogen of a local hydrogen supply chain integration of hydrogen into council fleet will rely upon new market technology and equipment that is relatively untested or proven in a commercial application the proposed two-stage procurement process will assist council in reducing council 's risks by ensuring any rft shaped by market input that best meets council 's council 's operational requirements the assessment criteria for the initial eoi will focus on supplies who demonstrate technology and supply arrangement that meets the requirements particularly around safety value for money and environmental responsibilities thanks ben uh comments or questions council bonds just a question ben are there any opportunities to partner with lgaq or another government i mean it 's possible we haven 't explored that as an option in this uh in this recommendation today yeah there are a lot of councils looking at hydrogen and opportunities this is a really unique supply arrangement we 're considering for our council but i think uh if our trial is successful other councils will sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them on a broader you know an expanded um you know project in partnership with other local governments yeah we 're part of ongoing discussions with lgaq they 've got a hydrogen group that talks regularly around this this matter um so they 're aware of what we 're doing we 're aware of some of the conversations they 're having across queensland which help shape some of the thinking here townsville being an example that we 're talking to uh thanks ben i 'm sorry yeah just to add to that i know the counselor has uh through health or other reasons has it been able to attain a number of meetings there was actually a motion that this council as one of the only 77 councils in queensland took to the state conference the lgaq about preparing business case and opportunities for hydrogen and asking the state and the federal government to assist so so we can have a broad spectrum of hydrogen roll out across the whole of queensland we 've had a number of meetings in relation to that a number of discussions from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construct of vehicles as well that certainly has gone around i i note the interest of the council a bit a number of those matters have been addressed that length uh and times before thank you mr any other questions or comments yeah would it be a true statement to say that we 're centrally positioned to supply uh fuel uh technology to um major industry from here in london yeah i think they 'd be accurate we 've got um potentially the vehicle supply assembly capability now in our region uh to produce vehicles but in terms of um you know the biomass and the other attributes require natural attributes required to produce hydrogen but also well positioned in that regard any other questions or comments mr ben no okay thanks ben the next item 's our financial summary as that one november uh welcome jody in the absence of simon and doug hot seat [Music] good morning everyone this morning i 'm presenting item f1 which is the financial summary as at the 1st of november 2021. this is a requirement under the local government regulations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial summary for the 1st of november be noted by council a few points to note as per attachment 1 just looking at the recurrent revenue section for fees and charges development activity within the region is continuing to drive revenues higher than anticipated airport revenue is still affected by travel restrictions and is lower than budgeted however this is offset by holiday park occupancies which remain high the revenue section is also showing proceeds from sale of developed land which relates to three parcels of land sold this year and there are further lots under conditional contracts just moving on to recurrent expenditure employee costs are tracking well compared to budget and will continue to be closely monitored materials and services are generally on budget there 's some annual payments such as insurances which impact on the quarterly comparative figures however these will be monitored through the remainder of the year just looking at capital expenditure if we look at figure four you 'll probably see that as a percentage of the budget the actuals are actually slightly down however this is pretty common for quarter one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see that the year-to-date expenditure is actually tracking closely to the forecast spending pattern for this time of year capital grants are pretty much on track probably the only thing to note there is that there was a successful grant application for the anzac pool redevelopment just moving on to the cash balances that was all [Music] pretty much on track as forecast there 's a relatively high balance at the moment which would be expected coming out of the recent rating period and there 's no short-term liquidity issues foreseeable and finally looking at the rates data figures we 're sitting at 5.2 million at the end of october uh that 's probably might be more meaningful to look back to october 2019 before the effects of covid uh at that point the debtor balance was 6.4 million so there 's definitely an improvement in our collection right there and that pretty much covers everything for the financial summary unless there 's some questions thanks chad questions or comments everyone 's happy thank you very much uh we 've now got some sale of land and lease items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bundaberg regional airport precinct it 's lot 8 being 17 aviation crescent these lots have been previously offered for sale through auction or tender and they were not successful at that point the lots have subsequently been listed on our council website and we 've had an offer come in which is for market value the recommendation is that council apply the exception contained in section 2361ai of the local government regulation to that disposal and that the ceo be authorised to enter into a contract with the buyer and attend all items to finalize that sale questions or comments council bonds so the next item is g2 which is in regard to two lot sales on buxton road it 's lot three and lot four um council owns these freehold lots and has previously resolved to sell the lots as their surplus to councils need that tender wasn 't successful and they were listed again for sale on our website uh council 's now received offers to purchase both of those lots um the terms of that contract are for market rent and the recommendation is that council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government regulation and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the contract with the buyers and attend to all items to finalise the sale thanks christine comments or questions the next item g3 is in regard to another sale of land this one 's at 15 hull street buxton councillors may recall there was a report recently about the sale of this property however that contract was validly terminated or ended by the buyer since that time council has been successful in obtaining a new buyer for the lot and therefore it 's recommended that the council rescind the resolution that was made being item g1 for the previous sale at the ordinary meeting on the 31st of august and that council will reapply the exception contained in section 2361ai of the local government regulation um and that the ceo be authorized to enter into the contract with the buyer and attend to all items to finalize that sale uh thanks christine comments questions on that one no all good oh sorry cancer mitchell christine on that matter was there a deposit paid and was the deposit forfeited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much remember um sorry any other on that one no um g4 g4 is in regard to a lease at the bagara ag tech hub it 's for part of the lots hillberry 's is a new commercial strawberry farm that 's come to the region and they 're looking for some office space um councils working towards a commencement date of release proposed to be the 1st of december 2021 with the initial term of the lease being for five years with a one by five year option the rent will be for market value and the remainder terms of the contract will be as per council 's standard commercial lease it 's proposed that the exception contained in section 2361e of the local government regulation be applied given that the property has previously been offered for lease and that the ceo be authorised to enter into a lease uh with hillberry sorry hillwood berries p2ltd for part of the bagara administration centre i actually like that name better hill bruce thanks christine any comments or questions oh good thanks then we 've got a specialized supply agreement stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've seen recently we 've eight items of plant in our fleet for which one supplier is the manufacturer 's only authorized agent and as per the recommendation we 're seeking to enter into a supply arrangement with that agent uh without seeking competitive pretenders pursuant to section 235b of the regulations comments or questions you already know but that is a local business thank you um all right coastal sewage strategy uh councillors with the ongoing residential growth uh along the coastal strip and a significant number of unsewed residential properties also in the coastal strip uh we 've developed a strategy to service the area with surge and an assessment of the options has determined that the most viable alternative for us is to connect a diversion from the pegara plant across to rubiano sewage treatment plant and so we 're recommending accordingly and also as part of the strategy we 're also recommending that we do not commit to a a retrofitting program for the unsewered coastal properties thanks stuart uh comments or questions council barnes and then council about tales stuart has this some been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month 11th october um just by way of further detail um say the amount of reports attended that consultation day and it was workshop quite extensively was there an option looked at to maybe um declaring a um having a declared zone like in 10 or 15 years or something so that people gradually take over just there 's a hell of a lot of people on the prime prime real estate that don 't even have you know articulated sewage system and we 're sort of marketing ourselves as a smart location sure so um uh i don 't recall that that particular option was specifically workshopped but it is certainly one of the options that we had considered in the past uh the project itself if we were to connect all of the currently unsewed properties on the coastal area uh it would be a total cost of over 70 million dollars so it would then become a project that would rival the new aquatic centre as the largest project ever undertaken by council in the region and uh at the moment we just simply don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a position at this stage to actually debate it but it equates to about twenty five and a half thousand dollars per property to connect and pursue and i was just wondering whether like over maybe a 15-year period when people have got on-site treatment plants septic systems whether or not they would see that as a viable option when it comes time to renew or enable what 's add value to that property sure i suppose i don 't don 't dispute those points but at the moment our recommendation is that we don 't commit to any retrofitting program for the unserved properties uh cancer bartels um as a portfolio council we i 'll be presenting support and i 've had a couple of councils asking could we separate the recommendations into two separate motions if possible on the day that 's fine we can do that what council mitchell oh yes um stuart originally in this coastal sewage strategy there are about 14 properties on bagara road that are completely surrounded by sewage but they 're not connected to syria not available to them at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few kilometers from the city centre they have been extracted from that strategy how do you foresee that council might be addressing looking at sewering those property or offering the option to connect to sewage yeah sure so uh three of the properties that are in involved in that location have um have since been affected by a development application so i think the number of uh unsewed properties will be reduced but we would then treat them like we have done all requests in the past on a case-by-case basis where we consult with the properties we develop up a solution and then we make an offer to the properties on a financial basis for them to contribute generally we require a significant number of the properties to agree and accept our proposal before we proceed and then it becomes mandatory for all what we 've found in the past is that it is very difficult to get high levels of agreement but that that would be the process that we would apply again and that that can happen really at any time so what is the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach the residents of that particular section on beginning road or do you want an approach from those residents independently generally we we um proceed once we 've received a request from the uh from the ratepayers to connect thank you very much uh thanks any other comments or questions thanks stuart um next item is elise of a hangar christine are you coming back up thanks uh this report is in regard to a lease for hangar h2 which is to skills compliance proprietary limited um skills compliance have previously been um under a license agreement with council for the use of that hangar the license agreement given that it doesn 't have a long term on it it 's preferable that the parties enter into a lease for a term of three years with a further option of additional three years and that arrangement can 't be done under a licence agreement the proposed rent is slightly less than market value but it 's above the community rate this tenant is deemed to be or considered a community organization for the purposes of the local government regulation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if council chooses to do so also given that they 're a community organization to dispose of this property by way of lease it suggested that the um exception contained in section two three six one b two of the local government regulation be applied the remainder of the lease terms will be on council 's standard lease and rent will increase annually by cpi the recommendation is that council applied that exception in section 236 of the local government regulation and that the ceo be authorised to enter into a lease with skills compliance p2ltd for part of the airport land thanks christine comments and questions nope we 're good thank you uh the next item is o2 which is a renewal of lease to the woolgate men 's shed um the woodgate men should um presently have a lease with council which is due to expire in january 2022 the men 's shed would like to renew their lease for a further 10-year term the rent is proposed to be at the community rate and the remainder of the terms will be on council 's standard lease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in section 2361b2 of the local government regulation for that disposal and that the ceo be authorised to enter into a lease with woodgate men shed for part of that property uh thanks christine comments and questions council mitchell thank you i just had a question why doesn 't the term or the the term of the lease be noted in the resolution in the recommendation as in the amount of years it can be i think that the idea was potentially to not have those on the recommendation purely because there had been some changes and you 'll recall we 've had a couple of reports where we 've had to come back to council to change the term um if it 's preferable for council i 'm happy to add the term of the leasing back into the resolutions it 's just further you know some negotiations with the clubs may happen after the resolution that 's been applied goes through but the report says a certain amount of years and if then there 's a negotiation after that 's not in line with that report then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome to what the report has said we can add those back in if you prefer and i 'll do that as well for the skills compliance one thank you um christine 's correct we actually had one this week come in for the variation where council had resolved for five years and they went three years so it 's just more paperwork and come back to another meeting but anyway happy to put it in but that 's the implication all right thanks christine thank you next one is changes to the regional waste facilities gavin and i 've declared an interest in that uh conflict mister so yes i 'll leave for him if i get my michael good morning councillors um we 're dealing with as ceo said item p1 changed to bundy region waste facility actually opening hours as councillors are aware we currently have a waste and recycling strategy that was adopted in 2017 and runs for eight years right in the middle of it at the moment and a couple of points in that way strategy was that we would continually review uh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing um the most efficient and effective service and best value for money for our community and so that entails us looking at the sort of waste types that we accept at each one of our waste facilities um to minimise the need for unnecessary movement or processing costs um and also to look at the opening hours of our facility so they meet the community needs and we gauge that by continually monitoring how many people attend each one of our facilities on an hourly basis and usually review those every year clearly trying to ensure that we 're open at the times when people seem to to vote with their feet and attend the attend the facilities um and also to minimize the costs where we can so um this report uh is a review we presented it last year council 's remembered just before christmas and were asked to come back um given that there are a couple of new players in the industry so a couple of commercial businesses that have set up and operated so they 're taking some of the waste products and using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and certainly we want to continue to encourage that um but the likes of green sales um who are taking green waste um and um clydens who were taking concrete waste which would otherwise end up at our facilities so that 's obviously had an impact on the volumes that we receive and it 's a two-way street in some cases it reduces the revenue we get but also on the other side reduces some of the expense that we have in processing or trying to do something with those products other than putting them in the landfill which then incurs the state waste levy and we 're trying to avoid that unnecessarily if we can so this report really has gone through every one of our waste facilities to look at current demands based on the review that we did and proposes a number of changes so that 's crimping times changing days potentially i won 't go through each one individually because we have discussed this and workshopped it but i 'm happy to take any questions if there are any any questions or comments um there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh the closure of children 's on a sunday so we might have a further discussion about that during the week and if there 's going to be an amended recommendation we 'll advise council accordingly any other comments or questions no all good thanks gav uh no late items we 'll get councillor trevor back and then we 've got two items in confidential you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

Davis is a new relationship discussion questions what would you say Christopher a few CBD business houses house operators have contacted me and said current restrictions that we have on enforcing the parking restrictions aren 't working and they 're having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by instead of the petition has been notable also ensure that if it is possible councilors actually action and we are put the process back in place to the implement the parking restrictions in the circular thanks again suppo tells and a resolution of the council it 's effectively I 'm doing read this decision just by way of information articles brought to my attention last week asking countless times were also indicators of Celtic sparkles using those cutbacks subsequently pi 'illo an article Scott is the Austrian

clarify indexing ourselves I just think if dream Co V so before Council on any matter or issue that they have all the information available to them to to make a decision I 'll talk together we 'll see whether in a way the women in a long period of time because what I am obviously conferencing is that these were a suite of arrangements or code with 19 and we will be certainly dictated on by what the state responses in relation to obviously not just the distancing but also essential requirements but it 's going to be a following anyway because it appears to be only a few points certainly if we tell it to do every day it 's not an issue for me today revolutionary baby products their security but you have to hold off until we can be provided with additional information because oh they put

year of the city device from here is sixty and seventy six percent and this report is just a summary or a high-level overview of what our operating and capital activities pretend at this point I 'm against the budget point where the note is the revenue from rights when utility charges is 100 percent so we 've already maybe both ladies for the year and so that we show that you may be new when we issue the is not fun to be saved because it 's a cruel and so that 's 90 percent you can see on there too and the council that the operating surplus is a slice circles of 147,000 and if you got across

funds which would lead the the general problem of about money develop it 's appreciate under the the cash and the bottom is at the time of doing this report at the time of doing our last part was adopted in January we were expecting I heard also I could hit the video just on that and sort of just a new me in the middle of that night and I 'll sure it goes right down we 've got an allocated

happens and a textbook as we 're going to maintain the employee employees at this point of time the materials and services will see a may see a decrease in expenditure this year and better it 's really based on the time of the delivery of non capital projects and so once again it may be impacted by copa90 might see some some savings in time only right or attaining the capital expenditure and ecaflip ranks and became expenditure there and you see under match that we 're starting to fall behind in the delivery expected to live here capital projects once again and there will be two depended

i now invite pastor buckle to bring us the invocation it 's good to see you pass the buckle good morning so uh i just don 't share a simple thought but uh zig ziglar somebody should have heard of him he made this comment you can have everything in life you want if you would just help enough other people get what they want the point he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine service produces genuine returns so how do i help people get what they want or should i say what they need i think the simple answer is being kind to them serving with kindness the bible speaks of the kindness of god and if we take the bible it says that kindness of god leads people to repentance and corresponding to that god forgives repentant people whether you believe the bible or not the principle is that kindness leads people or directs them to what they really need kindness is not always being nice kindness is sometimes nice but other times it 's quite confronting because a person 's destructive conduct needs to be challenged and to not challenge it might be nice but it would not be kind serving people does not mean we always have to be nice but when we cannot be nice we should be as amiable as we can and as gentle as possible i think the bible again says it clearly as much as depends on you if possible live peaceably with all people as servants through our whole community i would encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen as nice let the integrity of your life though be for the highest good for peace and for the best in our society to help all peoples reach what they really need that 's kindness to all

2021,QbyP9So0mCw,20211019,1386.88,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",2596,um number one um okay well ben ben ah look that looks all right i 'll do it um so under the low government regulation um council can invite expressions of interest prior to um asking for written tenders the reason why the recommendations worded this way is that the act requires the council by virtue of the wording in a minute to reflect the reasons chris just perfect timing just don 't say anything different to what i 'm saying do you want to present your item [Music] uh is around the procurement uh planned for the construction contractor for the burger the new regional aquatic center the recommendation is that council pursuant to section 22 228 3 alpha of the local government regulations 2012 resolves to invite open public expressions of interest before inviting written tenders for the construction of the bundaberg regional aquatic center and the reason that the main reasoning behind this is that the construction of the bundaberg regional aquatic centre will be one of the largest single contracts that console has ever awarded the construction of large pools including the associated plant and filtration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaken by specialist subcontractors any issues during the construction or any settlement post construction can be extremely expensive to rectify and the proposed two-stage procurement process will assist in reducing council 's risk by ensuring it is undertaken by contractor experience and delivering these works the assessment criteria for the initial expression of interest will focus on contractors demonstrating they have sufficient experience and meet the requirements around insurances and corporate social responsibilities um thanks chris and before i ask for any comments or questions i just point out that the lengthy wording and that recommendation is to comply with the requirements of the act to actually minute the reasons why we 're going through the process and the way we are any comments or questions all good thanks chris and then we move on to finance doug in the hot seat simon 's not here good morning councillors item f1 is the final management report for the 20 2021 financial audit um that 's been presented today um it 's as part of the background it 's the annual financial audit that 's provided through the external auditors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no matters that were raised there were two matters from the prior year that have been resolved and so there 's all matters we have a clear clean bill of health and the recommendation is for council to note the final final management report for the 2021 financial audit thanks doug any comments or questions council haven 't been the audit fee of 158 000 is that you know what we expect every year or you know does it have to be done by the queensland audit office or we 've got any other opportunities to um okay the queensland audit office appoints uh independent auditors to conduct the audit on council 's behalf we don 't have any choice in who the auditors are and quite correctly i believe for private reasons on occasions the queensland audit office will conduct the audit themselves uh picture partners have been our auditors now i think for about five or six years and the audit fee is actually set by the qio accepts the audit fee that is set by pitcher partners and the audit fee for this year uh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no variation to the audit fee as to what we 're expecting because there was nothing out of the ordinary that they had to do does that answer all your questions okay whether there was any opportunity to to um negotiate a better deal yeah or an alternate order no the the council 's can no council in queensland has any choice as to who undertakes the order uh any other comments on the audit no all right and you don 't do the summary two dunk thanks um so item f2 is the financial summary as at the first of october 2021 um that 's presented um this is a requirement under the local government regulation to present a monthly report and you 'll be familiar with the format for this um the recommendation is that financial that the financial summary um for the first of october be noted by council just a few points to highlight um as per the attachment one the rates and utility charges have been levied for the first half the year and i 'll come back to a couple of points in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges as presented in the last month development activity continues with speed around the region and that 's reflected in fees and charges income which has been higher than the quarterly budget comparative the offs airport travels still impacted by restrictions in the state and in general the offset is that holiday park 's occupancy is or remains high interest on ovg rates point to note is that it 's lower than comparative years that 's reflected by low levels of rate arrears which is good news on an expenditure side employee costs slightly unfavorable against budget obviously there 's annual payments that impact quarterly comparatives and that will just be monitored throughout the year materials and services um around on budget uh on a capital expenditure um there 's 16 million that 's been spent year to date for the first quarter obviously that 's the trend is more quarter three and quarter four that 's a significant spend for capital as we go through the procurement process for the first six months uh point to to highlight around the grant for the works for queensland funding that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a cash basis [Applause] for the month ending september is usually the peak in in cash holdings as we 've received the rates income for the july to december quarter july to december half year and then we 'll see the trend decrease through to january next year but there 's nothing for any short-term liquidity issues that 's foreseen on the the rates as i referred to earlier i 'd come back to the rates outstanding for the september quarter is down to 8.5 percent comparatively to last year was fifteen point four percent um so a market difference um italy last year there was um covered impacts um and the just uh note that the reminder notices were issued in september um and probably finally is borrowing 's quarterly debt balance is 71.4 million comments or questions oh all good thank you uh let me move into governance and 2021 annual report presentation christine good morning councillors item g1 is the annual report so in accordance with the local government act and local government regulation council is required to prepare an annual report each financial year the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auditor general gives the auditor

mitchell good morning christine um page 71 of the annual report 4.8 changes to tenders do you have any more information on what the change was i 'll have to take that on notice council mitchell and find that out from council 's procurement manager thank you very much no other questions i 'll move on to item g2 which is in regard to the operational plan for the first quarter so council is required to present to council a report as to how councils progressing towards implementing the annual operational plan which was adopted at council special budget meeting the quarterly report provides a process for monitoring and assessing council 's progress in meeting the goals of the corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past three months with most areas achieving the target set each manager has provided a comment in the report on their department and sections progress so the 2021 to 2022 operational plan quarter one is to be received and noted by council i was just wondering do they do they the kpis change each year do they because some of these things we 're now measuring we weren 't measuring um last year yes that 's correct yep your plan oh yeah okay yeah and can i just ask a question in relation to all the ones at the beginning that we 're just tracking to find so the ones data 's being collected for observation and analysis in community and environment have they have those ones being put in um in relation to gathering data for their services with you i know just in response to that question councillor the um reason we do some of that tracking is for some of our funding programs we just have to record data so as part of that acquittal process so it 's either contracted or it 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services we 're providing whether we need to look at resourcing and you know changing the service delivery so we just look at what the trends are because some cases a high result for some kpis might be a bad one but you know if we get growth particularly we expect it to increase so we just want to keep track of that because then we have to report that back particularly where we get state and federal funding to say that we 're now getting more people seeking assistance and therefore you know request you know additional funding for the region so thank you thanks gav uh any other questions item g3 is the audit and risk management committee minutes so the committee met on the 2nd of september 2021 and the minutes are attached for council 's information and to be received and noted by council uh thanks christine comments questions all good thank you the next item is g4 which is a specialized supply arrangement for monday.com subscription um the specialized supplier has been previously approved by council in december 2019 monday.com is used by council to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council are using monday.com for this purpose council currently has 100 seats and it 's proposed that they increase and therefore given that the specialized supplier is coming to an end that a new specialized supplier be resolved by council given its purpose and that the arrangement be in place then until july 2022 and with a further option period of three years making it until july 2025 thanks chris comments or questions councilman p i have a question um so the jack taylor group they just on sell this product monday.com that we use um so i was just one like i understand with specialized supplier agreements sometimes the actual product or item or service that we 're purchasing is only available through that supplier is there any reason that we have to that we 're not looking at quotes from other suppliers because there are other suppliers of monday.com in australia and new zealand who do specialise in government um i 'm just you know the answer no um just in relation to the two questions we 've taken on notice if we can 't get answers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email to all counselors stuart welcome morning councillors so i 'm here to present the report in relation to the downer contract on the riviana sewage treatment plant council engaged down to construct the rubiana sewage treatment plant through a design build and operate contract which expires on the 7th of may next year this report proposes a process to transition the operation of the treatment plant back to council day labour and engaging down in an interim arrangement to ensure there 's a seamless transfer of the intellectual property as downer is the only reasonable supplier of the service it 's proposed to utilize the exceptions to tender arrangements in section 235b of the regulations and the recommendations that are part of this report effectively conclude the the contractual arrangements with downer and utilize those exception uh requirements in the regulations [Music] thanks john comments or questions oh well good thank you oh sorry cancer happened the fact that um for a three year period the arrangement for the initial period february 20 22 to january 25 is a we don 't see that we 'll be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um perhaps that third part of the recommendation is uh is superfluous in that regard i 'll uh i 'll revisit that before the council meeting next week thank you okay so any more questions or comments well thanks sure uh the next one is the library gav uh i 'm one so library services tend to consideration plan uh i 'll probably just describe it as a bit of housekeeping so um under council 's procurement requirements were required where we have uh the purchases greater than two thousand dollars that we have to get quotes because of the the i guess unique nature of some of the things we purchase in libraries uh and the fact that there are copyright laws which indicate that only certain providers can provide certain material and resources uh that we 're proposing putting this tender consideration plan so we use local buy now for most of the the products that we buy through libraries um but we exceed that two thousand dollar threshold which is why we need to put in this tender consideration plan so it covers us off from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparency in the process we 're following but also gives us that flexibility because we can 't necessarily go and get three quotes for some of these things because they 're a sole supplier or because of copyright laws there 's only one person who can actually legally supply it so happy to take any questions if there are any um we did this same um type of tender for bragg didn 't we yes yeah is that if you have an artist who produces in that case a piece of artwork you can 't go and get three quotes because they 're the only ones who do it so it 's just about making sure we 're getting value for money that there is a process around it um so i guess there is some protections where if we 're open to scrutiny we can demonstrate the fact that we we 're aware of it but we 've put a process in place to ensure there 's some integrity thanks many other questions comments no all good uh nothing late in open okay we 've got one item in confidential we 'll just close you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

AUS,QLD,Bundaberg Regional Council,Bundaberg Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/user/BundabergRC,Bundaberg Regional Council - Ordinary Meeting - 28 September 2021,KbFNtJIQBc8,20210927,4496.96,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",7087,good morning everybody welcome councillors uh chief executive officer general managers executive staff and those in the gallery with his here today and also those watching via live streams this the ordinary meeting of council uh there is no apologies for today uh and we start our meeting first all but first up by uh the traditional custodians of the land in which we meet here today the elders past present and emerging we also acknowledge those australians that have given the ultimate sacrifice to service to our country as well as their families and friends as well a lot that still suffer today i now invite pastor buckle pastor errol buckle to bring us the invocation second letter and it says god has not given us a spirit of fear but of power love and a sound mind and sound mind here means of sound judgment and personal discipline the abilities that result in a calm well-balanced and self-controlled life how relevant in our world today that we live right in the middle of fear going around so much with the media and and often in the politics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about but fear robs us of wisdom fear at its extreme becomes panic and when that happens it causes harm but to the person who panics and many around them paul tells me the antidote to this is real love not a weak mushy love but a love that considers as best as possible the consequences of choices decisions and actions upon others as well as ourselves a love that seeks the highest good for as many as possible i 've heard the saying knowledge is power but i would suggest that knowledge is only power for destruction if it 's not used with love as the motivator and with wisdom in its application with this in mind i find the bible asks the question how long will you waver between two opinions and i thought that 's an interesting question we need to discuss and think about and jesus gave us a parable that answers that in many ways he said who goes to war without first counting the cost so my answer would be i will waver between two opinions until i 've counted the cost and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i would say it 's okay to be undecided at the moment on anything but not to the place where we don 't stop and count the cost and make then a decision for the betterment of all to not do that would be wrong if we keep as our purpose in life the highest good to all the best motivated by love for our community i believe we 'll have wisdom to make the best decisions not out of fear but of love with sound judgment can we pray father i pray for the council both the councillors and the staff you would give them wisdom let them make wise decisions that better the whole of our community give them favor give them understanding in jesus name amen amen thank you pastor buckle uh the first item is confirmation of the minutes i now move that the minutes of the ordering meeting held on the 31st of

@ @ @ @ to have the conflicts in those two two days beforehand as as a guideline towards identifying conflicts prior to the meetings however i always err on the side of caution and i 'd rather have counsellors if there 's things that suddenly become [Music] available for information or or feel you know that there may be some possible conflict to uh to come forward so we 'll move on to the uh to the next item just a clarification there is if you want it noted as well uh just just to to make sure is uh council hammerman that has uh put forward item 01 in relation to a conflict he is chosen to stay in the room the matter is voted on there by the councillors and council of barnes abstained due to him identifying a previous uh uh conflict in relation to the to the said matter that 'd be all right yeah very good all right uh sorry councillor yes mr barry i apologize for the lack of um warning but would it be appropriate for me to seek a leave of absence for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's yeah it 's uh uh we we can put that into a general business but [Music] and then add it on yeah whatever it is i hope it 's all right yep okay so uh we 've done the confirmations and no other conflicts no very good so i now move to item d1 now i 'll declare that yes thanks council trevor uh we all love these new regulations is so d1 is nothing no one else for d1 d1 right so d1 can i uh please i now move the council uh gift the land at 24 aviation crescent kensington being 28 on sp311608 to the royal flying doctor service of australia queensland section limited rfds and two the chief executive officer be authorised to enter into an arrangement with royal flying doctor service and attend to all things necessary to complete the transfer of the land to royal flying doctors service kind of a second to please second is council barnes so this item is is a very important item to the community and i really really want to thank the the community for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short period of time considering we as a council receive the the business case uh only a matter of days uh before and on close to our briefing meeting previously so the royal flying doctor service in australia queensland section rfds intends to construct a new state-of-the-art aviation training facility in bundaberg the facility will include a new flight simulator uh that will aid in training royal flying doctor service pilots and air crews the flight simulator will be the first of its kind in the southern hemisphere this new facility will create a benefit uh for the bundaberg economy with proposed job creation during construction of the facility and then continue into the future with up to 75 pilots visiting the bundaberg region for periods of two weeks at a time each year to to complete their training generally this particular simulator that will be based here in bundaberg as we 've alluded to is the first in the southern hemisphere but it also adds to a repertoire of emergency services training that is available uh here at the airport and we certainly as a community support live flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both a fixed and a rotary wing operation but also the uh the lat air tanker uh that uh council certainly has been over the years to be able to to advocate for that uh particular aircraft to be based out of bundaberg to also then be able to put in place the the water carrying supply systems at the airport to be able to facilitate that as well as other storage this particular block of land has been more or less set aside whilst the decisions have been made with the royal flying doctor service board and we certainly appreciate this type of facility to be based and add to the repertoire the other one other group that i also want to acknowledge and thank here is queensland health for their additions to air ambulance officers to the to the wide bay area that shows everyone working in together whether it be all levels of government or all departments we can get a a specialised facility and equipment that keeps the residents not just the bundaberg region but the whole the queensland a little bit safer and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs the long-term benefit of experienced pilots visiting and training for their beechcraft aircraft from raw flying doctors and other associated groups it adds to obviously assisting other businesses grow across the whole of the region so i 'll just before going to other votes i 'll just ask any other councillors particularly council barnes if you 'd like to say a few words in relation to this proposal before council thank you mr mayor for the opportunity listen i endorse everything you 've said about this particular proposal the raw flying doctor service is a great asset for this region but it 's also a national asset across the whole country and the work they do is second to none and indeed they 're recognized worldwide for the service they provide both on the coastal regions and to the hinterland areas and the bush 405 000 as a gift is nothing to be sneezed at but i think this would receive overwhelming support from the community given the status and the service provided by this great organization thanks council barnes uh any other councils wish to comment council honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council on the decision that they are about to make today because uh from the hinterland representative point of view we 've seen fires we 've seen floods we see car accidents on the bruce highway on our hinterland roads and the the first call is those rfds and life flight pilots to attend those accidents which they do time and time again also we see the great risk that 's facing us this year and every year with fire and we now have the large tanker in bundaberg with the canadian pilots and i 'm sure that they will work in with the uh rfds and their life flight and and uh and use the facilities to brush up on their skills if required so this is a great advantage to every single resident that resides within our shire and also our neighbors who we rely on so heavily in times of emergency so i commend council to the proposal that 's before us today thanks cancer any other counselors wish to make comment by this one no i 'll put the matter to the uh to any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the item to the vote all those in favour those against so moved i suppose

council 's minimum amount for not uh for not requiring uh competitive quotes however there are no comparative organizations from which to to obtain quotes no other supplier has the same reputation capabilities reach and engagement opportunities using an alternative supplier introduces a risk out to council not receiving the highest caliber of skills applicants applying for vacant positions

service to be able to bring comfort and hope back to members of the community in so many different ways whether it be from assisting people to disasters to when loved ones have been taken tragically to obviously caring and seeking out young people and hopefully helping them with choosing positive options going forward in their lives and i know the that 's a going speaking number police chaplains

AUS,QLD,Bundaberg Regional Council,Bundaberg Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/user/BundabergRC,Bundaberg Regional Council - Briefing Meeting - 22 September 2021,4zPm9648218,20210921,1486.96,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",3002,uh so josh 's financial summary as at the first of september um the report reflects the recent uh budget revision that was put through in the prior ordinary meeting for the capital reprovision process fees and charges are currently more than the year-to-date budget as referenced previously has been a continued increase in development activity in the area also holiday parks are experiencing high occupancy that 's somewhat offset by the airport revenue as outlined in the in the report that that had improved around the june period but has tapered back off again with some of the lockdowns throughout australia in the development of land space uh we 've currently said one parcel of land and potential for a few more parcels to be settled in the near future as outlined in our report later on just reiterating that we haven 't provided for any budget yet this year for those sales so any sales that are realised has a positive impact on our operating result this year um tools and services uh close to the internet budget just worth noting that general fund actually are trending higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that we have paid a number of insurances annual insurances in the last month uh capital expenditure year to date 9.3 million was which is where we sort of expected to beat this point in the year just worth noting that the council has received 50 of the latest works for queensland allocation for the aquatic facility um totaling 6.5 million dollars in the last month cash out reporting date was 163.4 million which is close to where we expect cash to peak this financial year um obviously in the next few months there 'll be significant outlays both operational and capital expenses our rates at standing reporting date were 42.2 million noting that the uh rates due date was just after that after the reporting date hence the balance right now is significantly less than that there has been again a continual improvement in our rate collection um the rates outstanding as at uh today are lower than this time last year any questions thanks questions or comments all right all good thank you um next item is for noting is the uh minutes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee meeting uh not the last one the one before last uh any questions on that item from may no uh and the next item then is a specialised supplier arrangement for uh staff recruitment and he 's going to run that one christine next to counsellors item g2 is a specialized supply for seek limited which is the staff recruitment advertising a specialized supplier recommendation is put before council as using alternative supplier to advertise for staff recruitment um potentially introduces a risk to council by not receiving the highest caliber of applicants seek limited um has a dominating market share proven results and the ability to integrate with council 's talent management system scout as we call it so for that reason the recommendation put towards council is that council into and tour arrangement we seek pursuant to section 235 of the local government regulation and that arrangement be in place for a period of three years thanks christine any comments or questions the next item is g3 which is the sale of three lots at heritage oaks estate the lots have previously been offered for sale as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailboat auction but that was not successful and the lots were passed in the offers that councils received on each of those lots are for market value and for that reason the recommendation is that council applied the exception contained in section 2361ai of the local government regulation for each of those three lots and that the ceo be authorised to enter into a contract of sale with the buyers and finalize the sale of those lots thanks christine the comments or questions is it correct that there 's only three lots left uh yes there is three lots left after this so after these sales go through in in heritage good morning councillors i 've got two reports here in this session a section that are similar uh both specialized supplier arrangements uh both seeking to continue current arrangements the first is for parts and service for our komatsu equipment we 've got five of planned items in house that are komatsu brand so as per the the recommendation that 's in the report we 're seeking to utilize the specialised supplier provisions and the regulation to deal exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our kumatsu equipment for a period of three years thanks stuart any questions or comments counselor mitchell thank you um there 's no supplier here in bundaberg the nearest one is in gladstone so i understand the idea of supporting you know a company that 's actually on the ground and has stock and things like that this company 's not in bundaberg what 's stopping us from ordering online um i suppose there 's there 's two things one is that online we would be getting from komatsu and potentially we 'd be getting from kamatsu gladstone being the local local supplier anyway but um it 's partly also building the relationship with the people who who uh would be servicing our equipment so it 's not just parts it 's also repairs and services so some of it is they they send a um a tradesman here to do work uh on on our equipment and some of it is we send our gear to their workshop so it 's not just about buying the the parts but it 's also about building the relationship with uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in the interim three years that we 're locked into a contract with a gladstone firm if somebody in bundaberg was to take on a komatsu dealership we wouldn 't be able to deal with them we do have a standard condition in our contracts that we can terminate on our terms i think it 's worth six months notice or something like that but it would be extremely unlikely that uh komatsu would uh open up a new dealership um they are very few and far between uh to some extent i think we 're a bit lucky to have one in gladstone thank you very much uh council mcphee both of my questions just answered oh okay council trevor i think uh looking at the spend uh stuart would it not be true to say that uh the major part of those spends is not maintenance is uh capital purchase no this this isn 't for capital purchase so this the the major part there would be i expect if we had a um something like a transmission or a final drive rebuild or something that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah maintenance or repairs or services it 's um uh they 're they 're big yellow plant and any repairs uh significant costs you can easily do a twenty or thirty thousand dollar item just on one single repair i i just wonder aloud if we 're incurring that sort of maintenance cost 2019 that we maybe should be looking at some of those bigger ticket items to plant getting rid of them sooner absolutely i think what you 're seeing there is that we weren 't spending enough money on uh plant replacement which we are which we have corrected the last couple of years and we 've got still two more years of accelerated spending to catch up i just want to make that point to my fellow councillors that when you look at that it is important that we continue that capital renewal program um any other questions on h1 no council mitchell 's skated vote cake for h2 so h2 is along similar lines we we have quite a number of items of john deere equipment in our fleet the rdo are the um are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one we 're looking to continue past practices uh or current practice uh to deal exclusively with the authorized service agent uh thanks stuart questions or comments all right all good thank you i 'll get councillor mitchell back and then we 'll move on to communion cultural sponsorship you 're doing this one uh this is i won uh sponsorship of bundaberg broadcasters carols by candlelight event um i 'm shim counselors be relatively familiar with this event it 's been running for a long time in fact 62 years and the event was cancelled like a lot of other events last year due to covert they 're proposing to put it on again this year and um have written into council seeking some financial support um because there are extra costs i guess um given the covert environment we 're operating in so bunny broadcasters who are delivering the event um have uh sought councils um or requested council 's interest in providing sponsorship to the value of five thousand dollars uh towards the event um and staff have recommended that under our sponsorship and partnership program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past years uh previous years uh it 's a very good question council scooper i just asked the staff that myself i haven 't got a response yet i believe previously we just provided the grounds for free but i 'll actually circulate once i get the response back if there was any financial contribution previously okay we 'll be looking at doing that as well this year gap providing that like waving the fees for the facility yeah yes um and can you just explain to me why this is coming under the partnerships and sponsorship program as opposed to the community services program because that 's up to 5000. yeah um i guess the nature of the grants so rather than a grant for the process they 've sought sponsorship where we get you know part of the program is will you know council 's logo will be displayed we get some naming rights responsibilities and those sort of things so for some things um particularly sporting and i guess you know event type processes we use a sponsorship program rather than a grant grants usually for community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver and they want it for to cover the costs with some of these things they put forward a sponsorship program where i 'll put forward a program where they are seeking sponsors and we take up a certain level of sponsorship so we do that for things like um the bundy fruit and veggie growers or we 've provided sponsorship for that we 've done the same for candy coal and some other things where we take on a sponsorship rather than provide a grant and do all of those um ones that come through the partnerships and sponsorship program do they all come before council they do yeah yeah so the community grants don 't but the sponsorships do because effectively council 's deciding whether it wants its logo i guess and other things associated with the event or not and i guess um part of it is usually that our marketing get involved then because we are taking up a sponsorship in i guess promoting it or working with the event organizers to make sure that we provide the logos and those sort of things yeah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sponsorship program do they have um an application like a set application it doesn 't go through the smarty grants platform ah no they usually just put in a request um and then it 's assessed and then we 'll have some discussions with them about what pension it is and so what does that sponsorship involve you know what what how is council going to be reflected in it um and so they 've sort of put that together to sort of say that you know our logo will go in there any promotions or advertising they do will reflect the fact that council 's a partner so uh councillor honor yeah question in regard to the reference to sponsorship does that mean that whenever we use that media source there has to be a declaration made that council is a sponsor of that of programs that are run by other broadcasters um yeah i mean you hear a lot of things on um television where it promoters and that promotes something through a radio station or and it has to be declared that it 's you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsorship program uh they signed an agreement with us so as part of this program if it 's approved they sign an effective sponsorship agreement so and that you know outlines i guess council 's expectations in regards to what that sponsorship means so you know they shouldn 't be displaying council in a bad light you know we 're providing the support that should be acknowledged in anything they put out regarding the event um and sometimes the event organizers themselves will put in particular things to say what that spence responsible so in titles sponsored too so we might you know they might invite some elected rep or the mayor to do an opening of the event or something like that some cases there 's some other ancillary process associated with it so they 'll do a launch they might ask for council representation at the launch as well so within regards to something that may happen where there 's an injury we are not the event organizer or the event deliverer we are appealing simply as sponsors so um public liability has got to be held by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that obligation we 're purely simply saying that we 're supporting it and providing a financial contribution in this particular case towards it so that 's our some total available legal responsibility or liability uh thanks gabe any other questions okay the next item is o2 so we 've had a request um via bundaberg police um wanting to put on what they call rider so it 's the road safety youth driver awareness program um it 's uh supported by uh bundaberg rotary club locally um they run it in august and they target year 10 students um in trying to make them i guess road safety aware they 've asked for use of the recreational precinct so it 's august 2022 so next year um to do this particular element so there 's a little bit of i guess in classroom road safety education and they do a little bit in a car where they explain obviously how motor vehicle operates um so you 've got young kids who are about to go through their learner 's permit process so the police run this program and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached council written in a letter seeking our support by the way of waving of the fees for the recreational precinct they 're aware of the fact and i think the fees that we 've listed that would be applicable for this particular event would amount to just over two thousand dollars for a five-day event and that 's all they 're proposing to have they 've indicated they 'll be flexible they 're aware of the fact that if they were to get it for free we 're not going to bump other events that are paid so they 're working around that so they 've already given that commitment so the staff have assessed it we believe probably it 's a really positive initiative good local road safety one particularly for young kids locally because that 's who it 's targeted at um and so the officers have recommended that we wave that work in with them to find a suitable time in august next year when we can hold it without any clashes with other events maybe take any questions councillors this report is largely an update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your endorsement to undertake negotiations to develop the wide bay burnet urban water alliance which is affectionately known as weber we 've done some work since then and are at the point where we 're now seeking uh endorsement from council to formalize our involvement in that the negotiations with the other councils have been successful so we 're seeking uh council 's confirmation of our inclusion in wubba under the terms of reference that have been attached to the report and that our branch manager water service has been endorsed as the first chair of wubba so largely this wubber is to replace the formula arrangement that was part of webrock thanks george questions or comments obviously uh the water services section have been taking notice of the new alliance with great britain america and australia to try and get a really snazzy name up yeah perhaps um there is something better than wobble but we haven 't come up with anything no joke there mr matt no okay thanks stuart all right that 's all we have in yep uh and then we 've got three items in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yep you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

seconded seconder is uh councillor uh mclaughlin all those in favour hi thanks tracy uh all good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all as a council as a community we acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land that we meet here today and as well as the elders both past present and emerging we also acknowledge those australians and their families who have given the ultimate sacrifice of service to our country now before we go into the the official part of the meeting i now welcome back uh pastoral buckle and i now invite him uh to bring us an invocation for today thank you good morning as such i 'm just a representative of of that group i 'm i want to make it clear as a second point it 's not me representing a church it 's the churches and so uh every person who collapses in the census to be christian that 's who i 'm here representing and uh i 'd like to uh continue by speaking to our elected officials predominantly you are custodians in essence of the power or a power of attorney of this region we 've all seen the dispute recently i suppose with britney spears and her dad jamie as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the word stewards and makes it very clear there 'll always be a day of accountability or a day of reckoning what i think is people forget that governments don 't own any money they manage it or the steward things that are entrusted to them by the people the word custodians is actually a very appropriate word for in measure we 're all just custodians even of our own lives as we can see in circumstances around us there 's a great responsibility with accountability that comes with that role the more transparent we are as leaders the less anxiety people will have and if we understand the process of life anxiety leads to fear fear to anger and anger leads to violence so if we can reduce that it 's going to help as regional councillors you as stewards for the people of this amazing region and the benefits it provides including how you handle the finances this community and trust to your care i commend each of you firstly for your willingness to take on the responsibility and my prayer is that you will be treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree with you you have to make decisions i encourage you to keep doing your best in this role as custodians and the responsibilities you have as members for our community as a pastor i see the bible teachers respect for all those in authority and accordingly i will teach that and do my best of my ability to make that commitment in my life and the wider church community i hope you understand that does not mean i 'll agree with everything you decide to do that 's a personal responsibility let us pray heavenly father in these challenging times i pray for our counselors and the council staff they might have wisdom and courage with understanding and compassion in the days that lie ahead of us as stewards and custodians of this region and we ask this in jesus name amen amen thank you uh pastor

councilman mitchell uh councillor bartolz we should speak further in relation to the motion yes mr mean yep the background behind this report is that council has been approached by some farmers requesting if council has any water available to purchase in response to those requests council has identified that it 's water allocation of a thousand mega liters wa 7190 on cpap 6975 purchased to ensure future water supply for bundaberg regional council council area is surplus to council 's needs for this year ending 30th of june 2022 the announced allocation for medium priority water in the bundaberg scheme is currently 22 meaning council has 220 mega litres available for temporary transfer allowing the water to be temporary transfer means that council is making available additional order for farmers it would otherwise potentially be unused obtaining some financial benefit for the best use of a community asset and by using a water broker and auction process council is removed from the process ensuring that it 's open and transparent temporary transfer is available to all interested parties thanks councillor battles any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no all those in favor hi it 's against no so moved next item is item k1 it 's a request for variation of terms the open development so i now move uh that 's gerlock developments propriety limited be advised that council does not agree to vary the bundaberg open for development infrastructure agreement for da 321.208.50212.1 dot you have a second of please second that is council bartels um he 's for this matter here i 'll just ask for clarity uh mr ceo if you 'd like to provide some information to the councils uh thank you mr mayor um the applicant is trying to retrospectively amend an infrastructure agreement that was signed in september to 2017 so almost four years ago that infrastructure agreement has been amended by council three times uh the reasons actually for refusing to agree to the further amendment uh the fact that the developer believes they can complete additional stages by the new completion date the current completion date wasn 't known at the time they entered into the agreement the application was only for the stages they reasonably believed they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied for the remainder of their stages and i think most importantly was that it was an oversight by the developer not to apply for the whole of the remaining development uh subsequently the planners have assessed the request and uh recommending that no further uh amendment be agreed to for the existing infrastructure agreement thanks mr ceo does any other councils wish to raise any queries or speak against the motion no all those in favor of the motion hi those against no so moved the next item is item l1 uh i 've identified a possible conflict and i 'll be vacating the room and councillor i 'll be staying out and what i 'll do is as far as a meeting procedure-wise is uh ask the the ceo to to guide my fellow councillors through uh electing a chair for this matter bearing in mind the deputy mayor is he 's an apology for today thank you mr mayor so councillors under council standing orders clause 2.1.3 uh council can nominate by uh mover in a second or in a vote for someone to uh act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in favor of council martials chairing the meeting for this item thank you thanks tracy uh council martells thank you mr ceo the next item on the agenda is item l1 it 's um from the planning and development services the subject is wearing road bogara material change use for veterinary service and reconfiguring the lot for subdivision i 'd like to move the recommendation development application 525.2020.19.1 detailed below be decided as follows location details wearing road bugara real property description lot 5 on sp 25 9466 local government area bundaberg regional council details of the proposed development development permit for combined combined mcu and rol so material change use and a reconfiguration of lot veterinary service subdivision and easement access the decision details the recommendation is the application be refused you 'll have a second for that motion thank you council mclaughlin i 'd like to hand over to the ceo for further background behind this reason uh thanks council bartels uh there 's a lot of information in this report and councillors will also recall that the applicants were given the opportunity to come and address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago i think the most pertinent information albeit there is a lot of it is on page 95 and i 'll just read from the section that 's highlighted as prematurity as highlighted above and within the applicant 's proposal council has not yet completed a local structure plan for the bagara identified major urban growth area yet the applicant within the submitted material recognises that no planning has been done for the area yet by submitting their own concept structure plan furthermore the site is located outside of the priority infrastructure area which identifies the area prioritised for the provision of trunk infrastructure to service the existing and assumed future urban development up to 2031 and it cannot be assumed that there is sufficient capacity in council 's existing infrastructure network to facilitate the proposed development the proposed development requires council to commit to infrastructure solutions such as the proposed road access from hughes road which prejudices council 's requirement to undertake community engagement as part of any local structure planning in an open transparent and meaningful way the proposed development also undermines the function and role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existing activity centres beyond what is reasonably anticipated for the life of the bundaberg regional council planning scheme and it 's considered that once the local area planning for the area bounded by watson 's road sea view road windermere road and hughes road area has been undertaken the best and highest use of both the site and area surrounding area will be identified infrastructure alignments and requirements will also be identified through this planning given above the above it 's considered that the pro the proposed development of the subject site for any type of development is premature and further the development does not bring any overriding benefit in terms of community benefit as it will not be delivering any infrastructure that might be used as trunk infrastructure when the surrounding area is developed so i think that nicely encapsulates some of the reasons for the staff 's recommendation to council for refusal council bartels thank you mr ceo um councillors are there any queries or speakers against the refusal motion council haven 't just um clarifying that there 's no capacity to receive wastewater if this development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i had earlier in the week with council 's planner but i might just ask either stuart or michael just to clarify that if i could just get mic 'd up uh councillor uh under our understanding um in the development group that uh currently the available uh treatment capacity at bagara wastewater treatment plant is committed to either approved development or development that 's assumed to take place within the priority infrastructure area beyond that the future servicing of areas outside of these two categories depend on council 's upcoming coastal sewer strategy thanks michael are there any other queries or speakers against the motion with the motion to the vote uh those for the refusal this application aye one two three four five four i 'm sorry six four one against your name hands up again castle lemon castle cooper council hadman council mclaughlin council

incentivize the use and uptake of hydrogen fuel across the state and also loan facilities for the private sector to invest in hydrogen infrastructure that 's required to grow the green hydrogen economy in queensland over the coming decade any questions questions or comments okay nope all good thanks ben second one has been withdrawn uh we then move on to uh the gift of two blocks of land in bundaberg south who 's presenting that one saying you 're here christine that 'd be wonderful thanks report is for a gift of land for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land owner approached council to offer their land to council for part of the wash pool creek project that 's being conducted some due diligence has been looked on the property and some notable comments is that the land is freehold it 's zoned limited development it is impacted by the flood hazard overlay and there are notations for vegetation management um if council is minded to gift that property or receive that gift of property it 's recommended that council accept the gift and that the ceo be authorised to enter into a deed of gift with the land owner and attend to all things necessary to complete the transfer of the land to council uh thanks christine comments or questions thank you okay simon financials report financial summary is that 2nd of august obviously early on in the year so quite difficult to identify any trends um but just a few notes from what we 're seeing so far recurrent revenue is uh slightly uh lower than what we expected um that 's been the fees and charges space but we 'll monitor that our recurrent expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's across both children 's services and employee costs in terms of cash at the reporting date we had a balance of 138 million million that 's higher than what we had as an opening balance due to the fact that the financials from last year haven 't been finalized and just a note on rates the rates have been issued at the time that we struck the levy we had 10.8 million dollars in pre-payments which was 1.1 million more than what we had at the same time last year so prepayments continue to to improve any questions on the finance report okay capital budget um as outlined at the consultation meeting councillors this budget provision seeks to carry forward the project expenditure from last year into this year in order to finalize the capital program it is limited to capital reprovisions it doesn 't have an impact on the operating result for this financial year it does have a minor impact on the long-term financial forecasts in terms of depreciation and interest revenue so the budget itself saw an increase of 18.7 million dollars in project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capital revenue increased by 1.4 million as part of that reprovision process the uh most significant uh project reprovisions were fleet uh 6.6 million central park 2.3 million uh vandenberg wreck precinct 2.4 million and believe in waterway naturalization 1.3 million the revenue policy and revenue statement are also attached and required to be re-certified as part of that budget amendment any questions on the budget amendment yes yes mr chairman in regard to the 18 some million that is being reprovisioned i 'm just wanting to know about the money that was parked as um in obeyance for the jinjin rail trail to match the nine and a half million that was brought forward by the state government uh in a rail trail um specific grant is that included in the reprovision here on this um project no it 's not it wasn 't in the original budget council 's honor and it 's not has been part of the reproduction budget the reprovision budget only brings forward funds from last year that project wasn 't in last year 's budget either so there 's been no new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there any um new drawdowns intended on our loan no the loan profiles remain the same as what was in the original budget as part of this reprovision there 's been no increase or or amendment to the the loan profile over the 10-year period thanks simon any other questions thank you cole christine item g1 is in relation to the sale of 15 hull street buxton this is freehold property that council owns and councillors previously resolved to sell the lot as it is surplus to council 's needs the law was previously offered for sale by auction but that auction was not successful and the lot was passed in councils now received an offer to purchase that lot and the offer presented to council is for market value it suggested that council apply the exception contained in section 2361ai of the local government regulation to the disposal of that lot and that the ceo be authorized to enter into a contract with the buyer and attend to all items required to finalize that sale thanks christine questions or comments all good and you 're going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes g3 is in relation to council policy review as councillors are aware council reviews its policies regularly to ensure that they best practice or suit compliance three policies were identified that required updating and that was the hardship policy the procurement policy and the buy local policy in the hardship policy updates have been made to wording in the intent and section 256 of that policy which is set out in the report for councillors the procurement policy was amended to add information and terms in accordance with the local government act section 7 was an inclusion of how to make a complaint and associated documents and controls have been updated the by local policy has been amended to include a new section 7 which is about providing an exclusion for professional services in procurement activities from the scope of this policy subject to review and approval by the procurement board concerns were raised about the advantage to local firms who do not have the requisite skills level or experience from other firms in neighboring communities given the greater experience in completing the desired projects it 's proposed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three new policies which are attached to the report thanks christine uh comments or questions all good thank you and then move into the specialized supplier arrangements and welcome adam who 's acting for stewart who 's on annual leave there 's about 25 items of kubota plant in our in our fleet at the moment and fleet services has a policy that we only use genuine parts at the moment council the sorry format machinery is the authorized parts and service repair agent in bundaberg and so we 're looking at renewing a specialized supply arrangement with format machinery for those kubota part kubota plant repairs and equipment so that 's done under without first inviting written tenders under section 20 235 b of the local government regulation the proposed arrangement is to be made for three years any questions distributes to ceo just to reiterate that that is still a uh a local company applying supplying those items yep yes absolutely item h2 is very similar it 's for the renewal of a specialized supplier arrangement in regard to massey ferguson parts and repairs council has seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet sings sales and service of the authorised parts and service and repair agent in the bundaberg area for massey ferguson so under section 235b of the local government regulations it 's proposed to enter into an arrangement with seeing the sales and service for the supply of that messy messy ferguson parts and repair without first inviting written tenders the period of that arrangement would be three years any questions item h3 is another renewal of a specialised supply arrangement for howard parts and repairs the council has 21 planned items of the howard brand nqas powershed are the authorized dealer for howard brand in bundaberg the proposal is that we enter into a specialized supplier arrangement without first inviting written tenders pursuant to section 235b of the local government regs with q in qas powershed for the supply of those parts and repairs and that period would be for three years as well any questions so item j1 is regarding so council owners declared a conflict way i need to read it out mr so yeah well i think we 'll save it for the meeting for lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temporary transfer of water allocation and the water allocation be wa 7190 on cpap 6975 the council has been approached by several farmers requesting if council had any excess water available for purchase councils reviewed our needs and for medium priority water there is twenty two hundred and twenty megaliters available for temporary transfer it 's recommended that council endorse that the 220 mega liters of water allocation be made available for auction for temporary transfer in the 2122 water year and that the chief executive officer be authorised to do all things necessary to enable that auction to occur and facilitate the temporary transfer any questions i 'll probably defer to christine to answer that question if i could having the idea with going to an auction so it 'll be through rural co water brokers and the idea of using it um by an auction and splitting it up into the lots as we 've said there so there 's four lots of 50 megaliters and one lot of 20 megaliters it 'll allow the open and transparent process so that all farmers can equally you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being rural water and potentially maximize the return of the council by using that process as well so talking to rural co water that is the usual process that some water takes so any allocations that some would usually have they have it sold through rural co under a auction type process given that they 're a government agency we 're similar which is why we 're suggesting that it 's a similar process mayor 's indicated he 's going to vacate the chamber check whether he has a conflict prior to next week 's meeting and wayne 's still out for this one as well everyone this report uh relates to a request that we received from a developer to modify uh an existing um butterberg open development 2016 infrastructure agreement uh the proposal relates to the bagara views uh state which was first grand approval in 2009 for 122 lots in nine stages and has been gradually developed since that time they gone through a number of iterations number of changes i 've included the details of some of those but for council 's note the last stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed in may of this year um in line with the incentives that were being offered by council at the time the developer entered into a bundaberg open for development infrastructure agreement uh on about the 12th of september 2017 for stages uh six and seven uh of that estate uh which were at that time uh undeveloped uh the infrastructure group was entered into and um effectively all right so the developed incentives that were granted and the two stages that were incentivized under that were completed and received their discounts note though during the course of the life of the agreement which was originally due to expire on the 19th of july 2018 the developer applied and was granted two extensions to the agreement and lastly received a further extension as part of council 's blanket extension of sort of unfulfilled agreements as part of our covered recovery package for the development industry the applicant you 'll see in the attached letter to the report is now seeking to amend the existing infrastructure agreement even though all the obligations under that agreement have been satisfied by both parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developments of the remainder so the whole of stage eight and the balance of stage nine and uh they want to include that in the agreement so that they can retrospectively be subject to the discounts um so councillor uh and the reasons for their request are outlined in the report and included in the in the attachment uh after considering uh the request counselors the recommendation is to decline this request primarily on the grounds that the bundaberg open for development 2016 incentive scheme uh closed over two years ago for applications and development that was incentivized under that has been rolling out ever since the rules of that scheme made it clear that any development that wanted to be incentivised must be applied for before the closing date of 28th of june and clearly this is much later than that the [Music] as i said the agreement has effectively come to an end in may this year all the obligations of the agreement on both parties have been satisfied and it would be unusual for i guess this retrospective change then bring that agreement back to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the council council entered into the agreement whilst it 's you know lawful to do and you could do it through a deed of variation to the agreement apart from those reasons that were in conflict with the rules of the original incentives program i 'd just point out that there remains a large stock of residential subdivisions that are still incentivized under the extension to 2022 that are yet to be taken up and as per the latest data available from the state there still remains a large stock of land available for immediate development and bringing to the market should developers wish to do so so there 's no need to incentivize this to make up for some shortfall in you know available land so for those reasons councils my recommendation is that the council does not agree to the requested change thanks michael uh questions or comments council mcphee um michael i read this thursday afternoon so i apologize if this question is answered in here but i don 't think it is um can do you know a dollar figure of um of the incentives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their earlier stages of this development application uh council i don 't have that figure to hand but i could certainly find that out and circulate that uh after this meeting thank you thanks council heatherman know council i can 't speak for the developer and what his intentions are i mean that 's purely a matter for him i do note that the infrastructure charges applying to this development though were applied uh you know at the time of the approval which was in 2009 so at rates that are much lower than our current infrastructure charges resolution so even without discount um the charges on this development are still lower than uh as if yeah you were getting approved today thank you thanks michael uh any other comments or questions nope okay uh now the next one we need to get counsellor honor back for leave the mayor out uh yes no problem thank you welcome all right and councillors item l1 deals with the development application for a reconfiguration of a lot subdivision for one lot into two lots as well as a material changing use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material changer use component of the proposed development seeks to construct a new building over two stages near the southeastern corner of the site adjacent to hughes road i 'm wearing road intersection the reconfiguration of a lot component of the proposed development seeks to excise the above described event clinic into a single allotment whilst retaining the balance of the land in a second parcel the proposal also includes dedication of new road which creates a new intersection on the western side of hughes road the site is located within the emerging community zone with an area of 4.59 hectares councillors as you would be aware council has recently commenced the local area master planning for the land within this zone bounded by watson 's road hughes road windermere road and seaview road consultation for this local area plan planning has recently commenced the commencement of this local area planning is important to know when considering the key issues described in the report before you i 'll just briefly touch on three of the key issues within the report being inconsistency with planning intent need and infrastructure provision other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report as detailed in the report the proposal is inconsistent with the planning intent for the emerging community zone throughout the planning scheme it describes the greenfield areas located within this zone as having uh growth and development to occur in accordance with local area master planning undertaken by council the zoning of the site as emerging community is in its simplest terms preserving land for fusion aid of urban expansion and protection of this land for it to be developed in the future in line with master planning as just discussed council strategic planning team have commenced this work but it is yet to be completed the structure planning typically the structure planning undertaking by strategic planning typically involves extensive consultation with landowners community and government stakeholders to determine the preferred land use patterns and infrastructure provision as you will have noted within the report the applicant has submitted a plan which depicts conceptual ultimate layouts for the site this conceptual plan shows numerous lots surrounding the site as being for future commercial development the applicant 's conceptual plan is not a local structure plan as referenced within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of public consultation to ensure that land is developed in the best interest of the community these concept plans in providing an expansion to the local activity centre located on the corner of rifle range road and hughes road makes assumptions that additional non-residential land is required for the increasing population in the area which is not supported by an economic need or impact assessment given council has not completed the structure planning of the surrounding area and how that area will progress it is considered that the proposal is inconsistent and may prejudice this master planning of the site and the surrounding area which is currently underway a second key consideration within the report before you is overriding planning and economic need as the proposal is for business use when considering planning need officers must consider the existing and future hierarchy of activity centers as vet clinics are an anticipated use within all centre zones the industry zone and the specialized centre zone this is not a use generally anticipated in an emerging community zone or in a low density residential zone as detailed in the report the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total floor area of approximately 940 square meters the supporting concept plans from the applicant proposes to expand the existing local activity center on the corner of hughes road and rifle range road providing an indicative land area for future commercial activities of more than 12 hectares for comparison the existing nominated district activity centre within bergara comprises a total land area of 5.5 hectares which includes a vacant portion of 1.65 hectares the information provided by the applicant best represents a development as being part of a district activity centre as indicated by the size and scale of the development and the expansion of centre activities approval of commercial activities outside of nominated activity centre creates unnecessary and unanticipated competition with existing and approved activity centers in the locality where development creates such unnecessary competition it can create an oversupply of commercial land and drive commercial development away from the areas nominated within the centre 's hierarchy furthermore such development can result in planned activity centers not being fully realized due to investment out of these commercial centres and could mean that other coastal towns such as burnet heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their communities furthermore the creation of an additional district activity center in baghara also could undermine the role and function of the bundaberg cbd as a primary urban area and a principal activity centre for the region the information provided by the applicant is considered insufficient to determine that there is a gap in available land for commercials for commercial uses councils you 'll also note within the report another key issue uh to know relates to infrastructure provision with infrastructure including sewer water roads drainage and parks and open space assessment of all these items are within the report and i 'll just touch on the pertinent points the subject site is located outside of council 's priority infrastructure area which identifies [Music] the area prioritised for trunk infrastructure to service existing and assume future demand up to 2031 currently council does not have a strategy for the provision of reticulated sewer network in the coastal urban district outside of the identified priority infrastructure area whilst it is acknowledged that there is existing sewer infrastructure proxima to the site there is no capacity for council 's surge network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject site were to be connected to the sewerage network the development could displace wastewater services the urban development within the priority infrastructure area in relation to transport the proposal identifies the location of a new tea intersection to be constructed in order to service the site however the location of the access is based on best fit for the proposed development rather than a solution that would form part of a broader transport strategy for the locality it should also be noted that the location and design of this proposed tn section restricts right turns from the new road onto hughes road which requires all southbound traffic to undertake a u-turn at the watsons and hughes road roundabout additionally the proposed access solution results in part of wearing road becoming redundant and proposes no further connectivity between the proposed road and the wearing road reserve councillors for all the reasons just discussed it is clear within the report before you that the proposal is premature furthermore this type of development uh in this zone has the potential to prejudice the orderly development of the surrounding locality for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sarah comments and questions council mcphee um are we able to get a copy of the submission there was only one submission was that it was against i 'm assuming yeah are we able to get a copy of that yes we 'll be able to provide that counselor the application was lodged 15th of september 2000 um have any previous applications been made prior to that for this project but have been refused or withdrawn or whatever through the chair development no applications had been received by council and no applications have been received refused if it helps council haberman i attended a pre-lodged meeting in the term of the last council with the applicants who at that stage were investigating various site options for the location of the new vet clinic but that there was no recommendation or conclusion drawn out of that meeting uh other questions council haven 't been so the only matter raised by in that submission was about the access of land fire wearing road there was no other matters raised in that submission no other questions nope all right thanks sarah thanks michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease to limited creative regions presently at least a part of the state reserve park um and they were under a lease in from 2018 um until 2021 so that lease is due to expire um in the coming months and the tenant has approached council and they wish to renew their lease for a further term of three years it 's proposed that that lease will be um for less than market value but it won 't be at the community rate that we have and the rent will increase by um three percent uh each year and it 's proposed that um council apply the exception contained in section two three six one b two given that it 's a disposal of a lease to a community organization and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the lease with creative regions thanks christine comments or questions council mcphee i 'm just wondering um why it 's not at the community rate and the definition of a community organization includes like the traditional community sporting groups and not-for-profits so i guess it allows council to reduce the rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else on that one no we 'll go on to the next one uh the this is for the lease to bundaberg fruit and veggie growers um they 're proposing to lease a small space down at the ag tech hub it 's only 10 meters squared the lease that they 're looking at entering into is for initial term of one year with two one-year options again this is a similar type situation where they 're a not-for-profit organization so they are receiving rent at a concessional rate um and the rent is proposed to increase by two percent or cpi whichever is the higher and it 's proposed that the terms of this new lease will be on council standard terms at least and for that reason it 's um recommended that council apply the exception contained in section 2361b given that their community organization and that the chief executive officer be authorised to enter into a lease with bundaberg fruit and veggie growers cooperative limited for part of the bagara administration centre thanks christine comments or questions the next item is o3 which is a lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall that this matter was brought before council in june this year about renewing their lease at that time the resolution provided that it was a 10-year lease however the group has advised council that they 're looking at obtaining some grants and for that reason they need a longer term on their lease so the resolution that 's proposed that council make is rescind the part of the resolution that was previously made in june and then change that so that it 's a 10-year lease plus the 10-year option to the meals on wheels thanks christine comments or questions thank you what we got next um [Music] no a couple of late ones just doing those peter you 're going to do those yep a couple of late items councils because of some specialized supplier arrangements we need to put in place for the milby festival good afternoon the first one is a specialist supplier arrangement with harbour agency for the supply or for potential supply of entertainment acts for the 2021 milby festival the milby festival runs this year from the 29th of october to the 7th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter into an arrangement with the harbour agency to engage specialist entertainment acts including alex lloyd and ash goonwald who are solely represented by the harbour agency the nature of their specialised services and representation makes it unreasonable to seek competitive quotations costs for these engagements are in accordance with council 's budget and the account the recommendation is that council engaged the harbour agency for the provision of entertainment acts for the milby festival without first seeking written quotations uh pursuant to section 235b of the local government act thanks peter comments or questions council mcphee um i 'm i don 't know sorry peter whether you 'll be able to answer this question but i was just wondering what the significance of alex lloyd and ash grunwald was why we had to have those particular artists i believe they identify as first nations which is relevant to the milby festival i did a bit of research i wondered if that was why and i couldn 't see anything around that the next item we 're looking at it was very obvious but on these two i couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolios and so forth but i think okay that 's all right the second one is also a specialized supplier arrangement this time with the bella management group for entertainment acts for the 2021 milby festival so again tourism and events are seeking a decision by council to enter into an arrangement with the bella management group to engage a specialist entertainment act mitch tambo who is solely represented by the bella management group the nature of their specialized services and representation makes it unreasonable to seek competitive quotations costs are within account or in accordance with council 's budget and again the recommendation is that council engaged the bella management group for the provision of an entertainment act for the 2021 milby festival without first seeking written quotations pursuant to section 235 b of the local government act thanks peter comments or questions all good thank you very much no more late ones no we 've got one item then in confidential uh to do with uh relief from waste collection charges and it will finish the opening you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

greetings to people watching on the live stream including visitors from vanuatu sydney canberra and across queensland if council endorses the resolution here today it will be historic occasion there is currently no sister city arrangement between communities in vanuatu and in australia lugenville and bundaberg have much in common to share beautiful coastline tourism and horticulture to name but a few we also have differences in culture and heritage to share and learn from each other here in bundaberg we 're proud of our first nations people whose ancient culture will be shared with lugenville as we forge closer ties we look forward to learning from the proud kniven culture and embracing it for our people to learn and grow their mou outlines the objectives of our proposed sister city arrangement and what we both hope to achieve this includes exchanging and promoting tourism cultural understanding horticulture seasonal labor and education it 's my vision that bundaberg will become the gateway to australia for people from loganville all of santo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken to the high commissioner of vanuatu in australia and is very keen for seasonal workers to have a cultural induction program which i hope to be provided here in bundaberg when people come to bundaberg from santo they provide essential labour on our farms when they return to lugenville they have funds to support their families and invest in businesses that create jobs the ties between our cities go back to the 1800s there are many families in the bundeberg region who trace their ancestry back to lugenville and the villages across vanuatu and the pacific working together we can achieve positive change for both our communities this morning i was presented a uh a small timber carving of a turtle by one of the staff here and certainly this carved timber turtle from lugenville actually is a great representation of the friendship and the partnership turtles and mother nature have had that closeness and unique sharing from coastline to coastline over thousands of years and today this turtle symbol represents the great continuity that has been going on before bundaberg even existed but also shows the friendship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further into the future so councillors i 've had a second and i 've spoken is there any other counselors that wish to speak against the motion councilmans thank you mr mayor i 'm not speaking against emotion just say um a couple of questions i i think this is a great initiative and um i can attest to the fact that they 're the friendliest

that committee oh thanks councillor barnes and thanks for your clarification in relation to that uh the briefing uh outlines in the briefing thoughts in terms of reference for the what 's called the sac the sister city uh group will be drafted and presented to a future meeting of council and i believe that uh whilst we have this great opportunity with the collaboration between lugenville vanuatu and bundaberg that certainly being the first for in australia we want to make sure that uh the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future is brought about by hopefully all councilors being involved and participating in what will be a a greater participation of community groups that we already have here in bundaberg that are already doing work in vanuatu and the expansion of that thanks cancer

the proposal as well as any costs associated with these two council being compensated for the loss of infrastructure contributions credited to the amount of 76 000 such amount to be paid to council for trunk infrastructure or spent on embellishments to the park in accordance with a plan approved by council and that such commitment must be secured by way of an infrastructure agreement to be prepared by the proponent and three the developer undertakes community consultation satisfactory to counsel about the proposal before any formal agreement is made can i have a second to please secular is councillor haberman uh i 'll just uh ask the the ceo if you 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mr mayor um councillors might recall we actually looked at that site early last year in relation to a potential buyback which was brought to our attention by insight sjc the area in question is about 3 800 square meters so if the proposal goes ahead it will still leave a residual park of around 5000 square meters ultimately the decision will rest with the state because it has been dedicated as a reserve for park purposes but clearly as the report indicates that the council 's views are likely to be quite significant in the consideration by the state in any final determination so council 's planners are satisfied that the residual area still would satisfy local needs with the caveat that the developer has to do consultation to ensure the views of any local residents are taken into account and i guess the benefit for the council ultimately is that the the contribution of 80 or thousand dollars can be used to embellish that park which i think when we looked at it uh previously was was a fairly large clear area so the council 's planners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll report back once we 've had a final determination from the state thanks mr ceo does any other councillors wish to raise any queries or speak against the motion no all those in favor those against so moved next item is uh

move on then to the first item which is the mou with lugenville municipal council ben welcome morning ceo morning council of morning gallery uh this one this first item here um is seeking is a recommendation for the mayor to be authorised to enter into an mou with loganville municipal council in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of a new sister city relationship with lugenville uh by way of background loganville is the the second largest city in vanuatu behind port villa uh council was recently approached by dfat in partnership with lugenville council looking to explore links between our region and lugenville this is built on the historical links between our region and the pacific islands it also have the potential to strengthen some economic ties between our region and loganville around agriculture tourism and port infrastructure which are featured in in lugenville to govern this new relationship the sister city advisory committee would be reconvened to sort of administer arrangements any ongoing arrangements between loganville and bundaberg to establish this new sister city relationship and that 's really all the information required behind background to the recommendation subject to endorsement of the recommendation that there may be a small civic event um later in the month between um uh lugenville and bundaberg regional council to commemorate uh the 41st anniversary of the independence of of loganville city next week vanuatu sorry in the independent state so thank you any questions uh next item uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council do a specialized supply arrangement with three proponents as part of the reducing urban globe project uh the three proponents that we 're looking to enter into specialized supplier arrangements are companies that have worked with council for the last two years on the reducing urban globe project and the three companies that have worked up uh specialized ip with council in terms of hardware software and smart sensor controls to control the lighting infrastructure that we 've installed along the coastline as part of the reducing urban glow project those companies are pendula environmental schroder australia and comlight a s have all worked with us over that period to sort of develop unique ip to roll out that new infrastructure and technology to reduce urban glow along our coastline so the recommendation is that council does not invite written tenders before working with these two companies over the next two years to provide services for the maintenance and upkeep of that infrastructure as part of that project going forward so financial summary at the 30th of june uh just to note that the figures reported in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of year uh adjustments however the consolidated operating result we don 't expect to change at this stage so the overall operating result for this year is a budget surplus of 9.2 million dollars which is obviously a significant improvement on our projected 5.3 million budget deficit um the two main drivers of that were the significant revenue streams that have flowed through from the development activity in the area and also the i suppose tourism income that 's come through our holiday parks and uh also with the airport income so the two main drivers of the revenue in terms of the operating expenses the main driver was all the variance was the delivery of the non-capital projects um the financial delivery of those projects approximates the capital project delivery and i 'll go in a bit further as to what some of those things are later on um it 's probably worth noting that despite there is an overall improvement in the operating result at the consolidated level the general funds still at this point remains in deficit for the financial year so in terms of the recurrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two drivers for that one was that the water consumption was slightly higher given the dry period that we 've had also growth was about half a million dollars more than what we had forecast and that was across both the general rates and also some of the utility charges feast and charges as reference for about four million dollars more than budget um for the reasons outlined earlier interest revenue was slightly higher than budget primarily to our cash position being higher than forecast and grants subsidies and donations were slightly lower than budget the main factor for that was that the advance of the financial assistance grant this year was slightly less than what we were expecting we don 't know our allocation yet for for the 21 22 financial year however we 're hoping that if our allocation is the same as uh last year the lower amount that we received last year in advance will come across into this year so be a positive result for this year 's budget uh in terms of land yeah we had about 2.2 million more in sales than what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower than budget as were finance costs and depreciation as referenced the largest variance was around children 's services with about 3.2 million underspent on non-capital projects the capital projects we delivered financially 91.3 million worth of works last year um the budget uh was 118 million we 're currently working through uh the reprovisions um for the projects which weren 't completed last year and as will be presented to council in august for consideration cash at balance state was 147.2 million dollars uh that was significantly more than what we had forecast uh two main drivers for that were the revenue streams referenced earlier also many of the uh capital projects uh invoices that would have come in late in the financial year may not have been paid out yet a lot of those a 30-day accounts are made would be paid in july so the cash was still sitting in the bank that balance state uh rates deader um rates outstanding at the end of june were 4.1 million dollars which was represented by a 2.4 percent um recovery outstanding recovery percentage uh comparable to last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year five point six million or three point two percent if you go back a few years uh pre-covered that two point four percent um outstanding percentage is the best we 've had um in vrc 's history uh so some of the i suppose uh recovery methods that council introduced many years ago i think are starting to resonate with the community in some success around the recovery there uh borrowings is highlighting the borrowings at ballon state was 73.2 million dollars as referenced i think in the last report one of the existing loans was paid out during the last quarter questions thanks simon questions comments cancer keeper yeah yes uh mr ceo just to simon um it was unlike me to talk down uh a very good what appears to be very good result but am i correct in being cautious towards the numbers that we 're seeing today but much of the income that has uh flowed through last year may not be sustainable um obviously the land sales as an example that particular state which was successful um has now sold out obviously we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year similarly a lot of that fee income that we 've got through the holiday parks and development may flow through this year but it may not so in formulating the budget for the current year we were again conservative around some of those estimates um so whilst it was obviously a welcome um uh surprise last year we can 't be sure that 's going to continue through yeah sure thanks simon i 've got some further questions which i 'll go through one by one rather than load you with a lot uh first can you explain the consequences of the underspin the 24 capital or 27.1 million what effect does that have on the future outcomes yeah so as referenced earlier those will be considered for reprovision so those projects that weren 't completed um last year will continue on and we 'll move those dollars from last year into this year the forecast has factored that in it 's obviously a bit of a timing issue in terms of it was in last year but it 's now in this year relative to the operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year can you also give me some further clarity on the operating deficit the operating budget deficit from from last year yeah so well that deficit was formulated uh or that budget was formulated in april may june last year um obviously a lot of different environment and management and council were very conservative in their approach then um we obviously didn 't know what was to come in the next 12 months much of the uh i suppose fee income was revised way down we didn 't budget for land sales um you know we budgeted for uh interest revenue to be uh decreasing further around some of the earning rates so we were conservative across the board simply when it comes to expenditure we were over cautious with some of the expenses that were what you incurred during that period so um is that simply based on covert what it was based on yes yep um the other two i think you 've fairly answered fairly well in this sense can you explain the further turn around in the income i think you did cover that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the forward budget was the next part of the question yes so as referenced uh ford forecast um starts off in a better position but a lot of the fee income i suppose hasn 't been factored into the ford forecast we haven 't formulated the budget handed down in june factoring in that increasing fee income so again there 's been conservative budgeting going forward yep and just finally am i right in assuming that it 's not all smooth sailing however it 's still a very good turnaround in the result well it is a good turnaround the result um obviously a good platform as i mentioned earlier the general fund still is in deficit so it 's still heavily reliant on the other business units particularly water and sewage um paying dividends across to those units so despite all um i said all the positivity this year around around the operating result the general fund is still in deficit and they 're still not paying i 'm still not generating enough income in that in that fund to find the services that the fund delivers thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions i will just add that as simon said the budget was put together in march april last year in a period of great uncertainty and as you note in the report you 'll see that the federal government and the state government both brought their budget both delayed bringing their budgets down to october and december so we still bought our budget down as usual before the end of the financial year but that would certainly be the reason why some of those figures are now appear to be a bit conservative because that was a period of great uncertainty we weren 't sure how long some of those measures were going to be in place and as we 've seen in recent weeks it can change uh very quickly again so we 're a good place for that mr sorry if it changes again we 're in a reasonable place uh look i think we are and i think we 've had the benefit of you know going through some uh tougher restrictions and lockdowns and and regulations so i think it 's it 's always easier the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to governance christine item g1 is about the show hold day nomination for 2022 so each year council makes an application to the industrial relations nominating show holidays under the holidays act in the past councils had two show holidays so the bundaberg show holiday is the last thursday in may and then the gen jng show holiday is allocated for people 's day at the brisbane exhibition in august each year um should council resolve to have to show holidays as proud as in previous years that childress and bundaberg show holiday will be observed on thursday the 26th of may 2022 and for jinjin postcode 4671 monday prior to people 's day for the brisbane exhibition which is monday the 8th of august 2022 um the nomination and it 's expected that um all council staff in all service centers will observe the show holiday as thursday the 26th of may 2022 the next item 's g2 which is about the christmas uh mr uh mr uh ceo um i 'm going to leave this uh discussion in relation to this matter due to my family members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes i am yep i 'm just going to put you on mute for um this part of the discussion um so the christmas closure for 2021 in past years councils agreed to the closure of council administration offices service centres and depots for business days over the christmas new year period it 's proposed that council offices will close on monday the 27th of december 2021 and reopen on tuesday the 4th of january 2022. during this period employees will take leave so monday the 27th is a public holiday tuesday the 28th is a public holiday wednesday the 29th to friday the 31st employees will be offered alternatives of taking leave accrued rdos or toil or a combination of those and monday the 3rd of january is a public holiday council will maintain an employee listing of who 's available for critical business during that period g3 is about the operational plan quarter four in accordance with the local government regulation the chief executive officer is required to present a written assessment of council 's progress towards implementing the annual operational plan at regular intervals of not more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council with most areas achieving their set targets and the assessment is attached to the report for councillors information um the next item is item g4 which is the delegations register review so by way of background section 257 of the local government act allows council to by resolution delegate powers under the act or other legislation to the mayor or the ceo the registers are reviewed annually or in our case we review them bi-annually in accordance with material that 's provided through the local government association of queensland that service is updated by king and company solicitors during the two major parliamentary summer and winter where they can be confident that there are no changes to those acts the delegations to the ceo the new registers that are added is the land regulation 2020 nature conservation animals regulation 2020 nature conservation plants regulation 2020 there 's repealed legislation for the nature conservation administration regulation and the nature conservation wildlife management regulation and there has been changes to the building act register the land act register mineral and energy resource common provisions act uh the residential tenancies and rooming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers compensation and rehabilitation act those registers and the proposed amendments have previously been provided to you councillors there 's also proposed amendments to the delegations to the mayor so these were previously adopted by council on the 20th of august 2019 and they 're due for review some minor changes have been made to the wordings in items 1 2 and 6 and a previous delegation has been removed as the legislation that it referenced was repealed and the proposed registers are both presented to councils for adoption thank you mr ceo christine i notice that there 's a column there conditions to which the delegation is subject on the register of delegations so is that an area where we could have put a condition that council be briefed after any delegation is exercised yes that 's correct you can add conditions to the delegations that are subject to in that register thank you very much so i 'd just like to advise them

one 's finished the item are they yeah operationally yes all right no that 's okay i was just not fast enough to and then we started this one so far away um yeah to find it it 's in relation to a the blue tick that 's on i think it 's the local by local buy policy on page 21 and it has a blue tick which says that the project 's come to an end is that correct can i just get the number for that under 1.1.4 promoting our region as preferred investment destination on page 21 as it is in our in the hub 1.1.4 oh percentage of the total accounts payable suppliers yes blue tick canceled by local average for the year yes so the question was yes we currently have met the performance target so don 't doesn 't it normally just like if your meeting isn 't a green tick what 's the difference between the blue tick says that it 's the project 's come to an end i think in the legend um initiative or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be incorrect because i think that 's ongoing because that 's an average for the year so that would be reported back each quarter is that correct yeah so that should be a green ticket each quarter thank you okay um any other questions on the delegation review okay we 'll move on to g5 uh councillors this is about a specialized supplier for aesthetic and the continuation of aesthetics annual service agreement um council has currently an annual service agreement with aesthetic for the provision update and annual service of aesthetic my data asset my valuer aesthetic smp predictor 5 and aesthetic fleet entering into this agreement with aesthetic for one year only provides council flexibility to determine what best meets the business requirements for alternative works management and fleet software installations to be finalized other potential suppliers for these functionalities were evaluated in 2018 an aesthetic was chosen as a supplier following a formal evaluation process changing suppliers at this time introduces risks and increased training requirements for the above mentioned reasons it 's proposed by officers that council resolve because of the specialized nature of the services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for council to invite quotes tenders at this stage and this resolution if made will provide sufficient time for review to be undertaken of the future requirements without the risk of interrupting core business activities of council thanks christine comments or questions uh the next item 's g6 which is about the sale of lot 33 in heritage oaks estate childress so as council will be aware with the freehold owner of the heritage oaks estate and those lots have previously been offered for sale as they were surplus to council 's need councils now received an offer from a buyer to purchase that lot the offer is for market value and it 's proposed that the exception contained in section 236 of the local government regulation um to the disposal of that lot be applied and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the contract with the buyer and finalize all items required for the sale of that property thanks christine uh comments or questions i 'll just notify the councillors that we 've actually had fresh valuations for those blocks that the council still holds given what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been no movement that we need to be met while we 're off wouldn 't the difficult part be there that because there 's been very little sale if anything similar to that except within the estate itself you can get end up with a false valuation because no one will be able to bring to the market land at that price in children 's anyway uh i i wouldn 't use the word false but but i 'm aware that the normal uh way in which valuations are done does rely on market sales in the same vicinity so if you keep them at the same price yeah it 's never going to increase i take your point um what do you think we should review it where is it well we can review it but i 'm still going to be bound by what a independent valuer tells the council the blocks are worth because that 's what the requirement is under the local government act so you can 't just arbitrarily pluck a figure out of the air and decide that 's what you think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation when you it means that estate has to be sold at that price even though we all know it can 't be brought to the market at that price today you 've got to rely on someone else 's subdivision somewhere else to sell at a higher price to increase yours well there 's been a number of instances where i suspect land 's been sold for prices that uh you wouldn 't be able to bring it to the market today wouldn 't be isolated to five or six blocks in children 's because there is no other similar land available you can 't can 't ever raise the price well no that 's not what i 'm saying i 'm saying that the valuations the council gets are currently up to date people aren 't climbing over themselves council trevor to buy these blocks of land i think we 've had one sale in six months insulars maybe two so um but if if we were having a run and i 'd then perhaps take your point that we may be selling it below market value but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuation with independent valuations attached to them okay thanks chris it 's g7 which is a sale of lot 2 at buxton road isis river so council 's the freehold owner of that property and that was previously um offered through tender which was not successful and council had previously resolved to sell that property given that it 's surplus to council 's need council has now received an offer from a buyer for that property and it is for market value and it 's proposed again to apply the exception in section 2361ai of the local government regulation and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the contract of sale with the buyer and attend to all items required to finalize that sale thanks chris comments or questions no all good uh the next item is one in community environment section um this is for elise b um f which is to lake ivis proprietary limited it 's for um a lease area out at the bundaberg regional airport so lake ivis entered into a lease with council for an aviation hangar uh back on the 1st of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ september 2012 and there was an additional five-year option the option expired on the 30th of september 2017 and then it was further extended so it 's proposed that of the lessee wishes to enter into a new lease to refresh that arrangement commencing on the 1st of october 2021 for an initial term of five years and then a further five year option rent will be for market value with annual increases of a fixed three percent amount and the lessee will be responsible for a hundred percent of their outgoings um it 's proposed that council apply the exception contained in section 2361c3 given that the disposal is for the purposes of renewing a lease to an existing tenant and that the ceo be authorized to enter into a five-year lease with a five-year option for the aviation hangar site bf uh thanks chris comments questions all good uh the another item o2 is another lease at the airport similar situation it 's a lease to lang and robinson so their lease is due to expire on the 31st of december 2021 and the lessee wishes to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of january 2022 for initial term of five years with a five-year option again rent will be at market value with three percent rental increases um per annum and the tenant is going to be responsible for 100 of their outgoings and the lease will be on council standard airport lease and again it 's proposed that council apply the exception in section 236 given that it 's a renewal of a lease to an existing tenant and that the ceo be authorized to enter into a five-year lease with a five-year option for the aviation hangar site af thanks christine uh comments or questions oh all right that 's it for governance thank you uh gavin um i 'm dealing with item q1 which is uh the 21 20 21 23 bundenburg regional council surveillance program for prohibited matter and restricted matter under the biosecurity act 2014. uh just a bit of background council adopted in 2018 our biosecurity plan and it 's a five-year plan um taking us up to 2023. the intention with the biosecurity plan is a demonstration under the queensland biosecurity act of how council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats in our regional council area we 're required under the act um to undertake a surveillance program effectively an inspection program to ensure that the region is managing and land oils are managing biosecurity um hazards so invasive pests and plants uh invasive plants and animals um and in what 's required is that council has to adopt by resolution the surveillance program uh the the reason they have to do that is because the surveillance program then provides uh officers um uh legal rights of entry then to undertake the inspection so uh the intention with this recommendation is that um we 're seeking uh effectively to have a two-year surveillance program the program has to be publicly advertised once it 's resolved by council so the landowners are aware and as i said it allows officers then to access properties for inspection purposes to identify any potential pest plant or animal on sites have you take any questions thanks uh yes uh i 'd like to uh make a question there in regard to accessing properties in the past uh mr ceo there has been some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto their property and identified a weed or an animal uh and have been concerned that they haven 't been contacted i understand that officers try uh all means to contact the person that owns the property if they can 't then this program still allows them to access is that correct uh through the ceo yes cancer honor that 's correct um the the officers do in uh try to obviously we don 't like to just trundle onto properties unannounced we do try to make contact one of the difficult sometimes is that someone might be leasing a property to someone else who is then farming that particular property and we 're not sure exactly who is running it at the time but certainly the officers try to in most cases what they 'll try to do is do surveillance from a public space a roadway or a road reserve if possible but if sometimes they might have to enter a property to you know identify maybe a particular patch of pest plants then they 'll do that but usually try to notify and take every effort they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a state-driven um policy and uh as council we are fulfilling an obligation under the state government 's legislation and uh the process is one that benefits everybody in the region not sure if that was a question council on a but yes um that 's certainly the intention the idea obviously with the biosecurity act is to ensure and protect queensland 's agricultural industry from the threats potentially of invasive um plants and animals thank you thanks councilor aren 't there any other questions or comments uh thanks gav uh that concludes the open part of the meeting we 've got one item in confidential in relation to a proposed property purchase so if i could ask the gallery to vacate and we 'll move on to the confidential item you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",4072,uh good morning welcome councillors chief executive officer general managers executive staff those watching on the live stream with us today and those in the gallery to today 's meeting to adopt council 's budget for 2021 2022 i 'd also like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land and the elders past present and emerging i 'd also like to acknowledge those australians who have given the ultimate sacrifice and service to our country i now invite councillors declare and conflict of interest or or and or meant material personal interest in the budget items to discuss the today 's meeting any at all no so my fellow councillors and members of the community the 2021-22 council budget marks the financial turning point in the recovery from a global pandemic which last year cast a dark cloud over our lives and our futures although covert 19 remains an active threat queensland has been one of the most successful places in the world at subduing the coronavirus i take this opportunity to thank our public health officials and frontline emergency workers for their outstanding efforts in keeping us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health directions and generously supported neighbours who needed assistance and i think that was heartwarming right across the whole of the community and i say a special thank you to everybody who gave their bit of time to help others in need the new normal means today we can live in relatively safety travel more confidently in our own state and most parts of australia and plan ahead with greater certainty council spent more than two million dollars on covert relief measures including community sporting grants and fee waivers we also had lower revenue from the airport and other venues and extra costs whether it be from cleaning or other covered compliance so it 's a credit to everyone that we 're now forecasting a balanced responsible budget in the 2021-22 financial year this is a responsible budget which puts council and the community back on track for recovery a capital works program is targeted to achieve the best value for the greatest community benefit in circumstances where builders and tradies are flat out there 's some irony that interest rates are at a record low level but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for construction workers and materials the good news however is the council is taking the plunge to build a new regional aquatic center here in bundaberg during many years in public office thousands of people have told me they want a new state-of-the-art pool for health and well-being it 's a genuine pleasure for me and my fellow councillors that we 're going to deliver this important generational project over the next few years the regional aquatics centre will benefit all members of our community including the disadvantaged and people with disabilities we 're also starting work on the moore park beach master plan following months of community consultation and i thank the community building a new surf club at moorpark beach will be the catalyst for other works to enhance the amenity of this beautiful area divisional councillor jason bartel

water treatment plant will which will meet future development needs and children 's and woodgate and surrounding areas for many years to come likewise the budget is committed to take starting an upgrade of the kalki water treatment plant which services our growing coastal areas councillors are always focused on minimising costs for residents and ratepayers it 's a challenge to balance community expectations with people 's capacity to actually afford rates and charges that are required to deliver services and projects i believe we achieve the right balance this year with a general rates increase close to cpi we 've consolidated two previous charges into a single levy which shares the burden of public safety across everyone in the community we all benefit from the hard work of our rural fire volunteers surf lifesavers and ses for an average residential ratepayer there will be a 2.47 weekly increase in rates and charges including and people have to be mindful of this including water sewage and waste the average agricultural land owner will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to all councillors the executive team and staff for your efforts in putting this budget together and i

council barnes thank you mr mayor councillors you 'll recall um at the last budget meeting i expressed some concerns about the um the impact of that budget on the agricultural sector in particular those within the category nine i don 't believe that this budget has fully compensated if you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their um their rates which flowed on from the unusual valuations that we received i 'm also not comfortable with the increase in the amount attributed to the levies the councillors i 've always been to the view that every annual budget will contain aspects which aren 't supported by all elected members this is the 22nd budget that i 've been involved in and never in my wildest dreams could i even envisage myself voting against such an important document but vote it against it i must since the 27th of november 2020 i 've been requesting access to a document of the council which was commissioned from a consultancy of ratepayers expense my request to access this document has been made in accordance with the council 's adopted acceptable request guidelines in section 170a of the local government act 2009. indeed the department of local government racing and multicultural affairs has confirmed that i 'm entitled to request access to that document in accordance with the referenced legislation access that document continues to be denied accounts i understand sorry interrupt but can you show us what line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get some the document itself mr mayor is uh relates to um expenditure of the council and i believe that quite rightly it in itself is a a document which is confidential to the council just just to help guide the council is what what line in the budget are you referring to well i don 't know i i don 't know i assist everyone what line in the budget i know you i know you 've said you 've had experienced 22 budgets prior to this you 've prepared your presentation this morning and all i want to do is assist my fellow councils in determining if they have to or maybe respond or not can you explain where it is actually in the budget well the the councillors were indeed copied into my request some seven months ago so they 'll be aware of the document that i 'm referring to sorry council bonds is what part of the actual budget is that referring to it 'll be in executive services and whereabouts in

AUS,QLD,Bundaberg Regional Council,Bundaberg Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/user/BundabergRC,Bundaberg Regional Council - Briefing Meeting - 23 June 2021,l9JXIInNzIc,20210622,1746.88,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",3004,today 's briefing meeting we have three apologies from councillor dempsey of barnes and councillor honour and council heaven and is running a few minutes late so he should join us shortly so the first item to be discussed today is a financial summary as at one june and uh chief finance financial officer simon counsel haven 't been on time perfect we only just started just finished good morning councillors virtual summary first of june our current revenue is trending above the year-to-date budget and the revenue for 2021 will be higher than the annual budget there 's a few reasons for that rates and utility charges will be more than budget the water consumption pending levy for the six months to june has come in more than expected fees and charges are more than what we had in the budget for the reasons outlined in the report interest revenue will be uh slightly more than what we had in the budget um given that cash balance has trended higher than what we had in the forecast and the offset of that is that the financial assistance grant advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had in the budget so the grants and subsidies will come in um coming less than budget uh and we obviously had significant land sales during the year which weren 't in the budget in terms of recurrent expenditure employee costs are fairly close to budget we expect those to come in just under budget materials and services are tracking lower than the year-to-date budget we are expecting them to be less than budget but we 're not yet sure what that will look like finance costs and appreciation should come in farewell on budget uh capital expenditure at the first of june um 71.4 million which represented 60 of the capital program um as of today we have got uh expenditure and commitments um representing 87 of the total capital program um so we expect some of those commitments to be paid in the next week we 'll put through as invoices in the next week capital grants uh predominantly on track noting that we do have some extensions for some projects in works for queensland beyond 30 june uh cash at the 1st of june was 156.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey balance and this noting also the rate status um end of may were 4.9 million um we haven 't got a comparative in there because obviously this time last year we had uh the coveted relief package uh in play any questions thanks simon questions or comments all good thank you and the audit report you 're presenting that to yep okay so pursuant to section 213 of the local government wreak we 're required to present the orders report as presented to management at the next ordinary meeting of council the intro manage report as presented provides the findings of the recent external audit that was done by council in april no new matters were raised as part of this interim audit there are two matters that were in the report which are a carryover from the final audit from last year and presented to council lake last calendar year those two items will be closed out as part of the annual final audit in september this year there 's any questions on that questions or comments just that on that on the one matter of the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any matters that might be outstanding that 'll be then presented to council will that be a quarterly thing or or so these these particular matters uh will be presented back to council as part of the honor report which will be issued after september they 'll also go through the alt-risk committee um but so the next report you get here will have those two outstanding matters closed down there may be some additional matters that they raise as part of their final audit and we 'll address those with council at that time yeah because one of those was the report on things that needed to be done from a statutory point of view they were being ticked up by individual departments not as a total list yep so in terms of the compliance um the compliance register which is one of the issues yeah we 've got a uh operational policy draft for that and a procedure that 's gone through the audit risk committee um at the last meeting in april um so that 'll be rolled out as part of the end of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next item is the sale of a lot and the policy review christine welcome um item g1 is about the sale of lot 39 at heritage oaks estate and childress this lot was previously offered for sale by auction which was not successful and passed in the lot has been offered for sale on council 's website and a buyer has offered to purchase that property and the offer is for market value it 's proposed that council apply the exception contained in section 2361a1 of the local government regulation given that the lot has previously been offered for auction and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the contract and finalize the sale of that property for council 's information the there 's seven lots available left in this estate after this matter thanks christine comments or questions uh the next item g2 is about the council policy reviews um there 's two policies that this report relates to which is the eco certification incentive scheme policy and the planning protocols policy the eco certification policy is a new policy proposed that council adopt and the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators to become eco-certified by offering a cash subsidy incentive in the form of 50 reimbursement of eligible tourism businesses in their first certification fee payable to eco tourism australia so that policy will be presented to council for adoption the other one is an amendment to the planning protocols policy before the um the current policy as it stands before a delegated authority is used by council to decide a planning application the report is circulated to the divisional councillor and the ceo to allow them to ask questions and um apply for an application to counsel or a formal for a formal decision or exercise the delegated authority um the current procedure doesn 't actually allow where divisional counsellors got a conflict of interest for that to be reviewed so the policy has been amended for that purpose so that it 's circulated to all other councillors rather than the one that 's got the conflict of interest the office of the independent assessor also provided recently to all councils in queensland an example policy which council 's existing policy does mirror a lot of but amendments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example policy so it 's proposed that council rescind the planning protocols policy version 1 and adopt version 2 and along with the eco certification incentive schemes policy version 1. thanks christine questions or comments no well done thank you the next item is the road investment strategy stuart morning councillors this report that 's before you it deals with the finalization and adoption of the road investment strategy we presented the draft form of this to you a few months ago and since then we 've gone out to public consultation on it the public consultation process provided 13 submissions which we 've taken into account one of them resulted in a minor change to the strategy uh in relation to sustainability uh and now we 're proposing that uh council two-part recommendation is that firstly we respond to all of the public submissions and secondly that council adopts the region the bundaberg regional council wrote investment strategy and releases it to the public thanks stuart uh comments or questions just just one uh if i can miss the ceo [Music] because we 've got such a long list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because things can change on roads quite dramatically one of the issues i just want to explore was we simply look at them from an engineering point of view and we rate them from one to 700 or whatever the number we have where do we go where we have major public concern about a road that the engineers rate is 558 on the list but we 're upgrading roads from an engineering point of view that we 're getting no public complaint about but we 're getting massive public public complaint for a road over there that we can 't just ignore how do we handle that situation is that a case that council a councillor would have to raise it at a council meeting or how do we deal with that because i can see in a couple of instances that i 'm aware of we 're going to have major public input into it and if we ignore it it ain 't going to go away but we 're just looking at share the sheer not a public satisfaction thing but a share engineering point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's attached to the report on uh page 49 of the agenda today there 's there 's a little triangle that talks about uh three three layers of the strategy the first one at the bottom of this of the triangle is inputs and the inputs are the the pieces of information that we use to support the decision making so the strategy is a decision-making tool but it 's based on inputs that include a whole heap of different pieces of information which include as you say the engineering scientific data so our asset management systems our road condition data but it also includes things like customer complaints and requests and they are every one of those customer complaints that we receive and we receive uh i suppose if we call them requests rather than complaints we receive uh three three and a half thousand of them per year in relation to our road and drainage infrastructure and each one of those is responded to and the customer gets close out but part of the the closeout can be that we note for future reference particular road issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of those all of those are kept in a in a system which is now the road investment strategy so the road investment strategy is about balancing those inputs to make sure that we get the best outcomes not all of the decisions are going to be made purely on the engineering science or the statistical data we recognize that we live and work in a in a political environment and the community is a very strong input into our decision making so um [Music] ultimately we we have officers who are well experienced in in driving these systems and making recommendations to council and and they base their recommendations on all of those sorts of data occasionally we will get them wrong but i think usually we 've got a a balanced approach to understanding where the the community expectations are but to balance the community expectations i 'd say that there are times when the customers the the customers being the community have a have a limited uh view of the network so people who live in a in a particular area will only have a detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and most people only drive on a certain number of our roads whereas we have to manage the whole network which is over three thousand kilometers so not always are the people who are making the complaints or expecting a change as well informed as they need to be to make decisions on the basis of the whole network so um yeah long long answer to a short question uh ultimately i suppose our approach is to balance all of those inputs to provide the best recommendations to council but there will be times when uh when council laws need to to tune up those recommendations part b if i may mr ceo of that is past practice has been that when people write in about a road we 'll respond back and say it 's not in this year 's budget but it 'll be looked at in future budgets now if if will will this change our response to people because if it 's 746 down the list writing back to someone and saying it 'll be considered in a future budget gives hope when in real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look it 's it 's well down the list be a bit more open and transparent with how we answer those letters yes that 's um that 's exactly one of the the great benefits of this new rate investment strategy in the past we we have not uh probably been as as precise as we should have been in those responses on page 52 of the agenda today there 's a little diagram that talks about three types of categorization of projects there 's must do there should do and this could do and and really the could do are the low priority and in in cases of the could do 's they 're the ones that we shouldn 't be leading people on we should be giving them a a very um a very fair response that says um it 's it 's unlikely that that project is going to be done uh we shouldn 't be stringing them along thank you very much stewart any other questions or comments no thank you uh the next item is some least renewals christine 01 is a lease renewal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due to expire on the 31st of august 2021 they 're situated over at 10 east gate street bundaberg given that they 're a community organization it 's proposed to have their newly renewed for 10 years on the community rate and that they be responsible for their outgoings so the recommendation is that council applied the exception contained in section 2361b2 of the local government regulation for the disposal of that property and that the ceo be authorized to enter into a 10 year lease two meals on wheels over lot one on rp one for six five three six thanks christine questions or comments the next one is item o2 this is about elise um to the salvation army so they presently have land at uh john cullen reserve which is uh on osborne street in novel it 's proposed that the lease be entered in tour for a period of 10 years and that the rent is at community rate and the tenant be responsible for their outgoings this matter has been presented back in 2018 to council um about resolving to enter into the ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bundaberg central men jed and the salvation army um and it 's just proposed that the exception to the disposal be applied to this lease and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the 10-year lease um there has been negotiations ongoing with that matter and i believe they 're now getting to a point where the lease is ready to be signed thanks christine questions or comments no all good the next lease is item 03 and it 's for a lease of 25 k street it 's a sublease to the state of queensland represented by the department of transport and main roads again this matter has been presented previously to council but the resolution that was obtained was for a lease entry of two years with a further year option the given that it 's a state perpetual lease that property we can 't have options on that property so the department of resources has requested that it be a straight-up three-year lease with an ability for the state to terminate the lease after each of the 12-month periods so it 's proposed to rescind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a three year lease and that the ceo be authorised to enter into that lease with the state for a term of three years thanks christine um councilman fee i just was curious is it state loan state-owned land that councils trustee for and then we 're leasing back to no it 's actually perpetually so it 's a different form of tenure so you have your freehold and leasehold or reserve land this one 's actually leasehold so council owns the property through a perpetual lease um which we lease from the state um through the department of resources and then it 's actually yes sub-leased to so we take the original head lease and then its sublease then on to the department of transport thank you we had looked to negotiate with the state probably three years ago to try and freehold that parcel of land but those negotiations weren 't concluded because of the expectations of the state on price yep any other questions mark thank you christine uh that 's all we have in uh general business today and we 've got one item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gallery you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

details in relation to the uh the motion before us here today thanks uh mr ceo ah thank you mr mayor this is a fairly uh straightforward request it 's a further uh extension of the existing open for development infrastructure agreement uh through to november 2021 uh the requests come about largely because there 's been delays in the development of that site um for various reasons but most of them attributed to the landowner themselves and a slight change to the definition of substantial commencement so it 's um it 's nothing out of the ordinary uh other than an extension of time for the council 's previously endorsed open for uh development uh incentive scheme thanks uh mr ceo any other councillors wish to raise any queries or speak against the motion no i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor those against no the matter is uh carried unanimously thank you we 'll just wait to the other council just to come back into the room this while accounts are going to the state council haven 't

and regulatory services item n1 i call uh counselor mitchell thank you thanks councilman recommendation is that council endorse the implementation of our own council food hygiene rating system think food safe thank you cancer mitchell is is there a second there at all second there is council learmont uh councillor mitchell used to speak further in relation to this matter yes thank you mr mayor the background is that council launched the eat safe program on first of july 2014 despite a significant investment in various benefits of eat safe the take-up rate and display rate of the eat safe logo by our food businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eat safe is not working a fully complying three-star rating under each safe is considered good very few premises will display a three-star rating as this is considered average by consumers a five-star rating requires a significant paperwork and this is difficult for our food premises to implement and maintain even for some of our excellent food premises consumers are not actively looking for premises displaying and eat safe logo and eat safe is not flexible and can 't be modified to include new priorities such as eat healthy the effective use of covert plans or the promotion of locally grown foods many other councils are experiencing similar problems yeah uh anything else counsel mitchell no thank you mr man all right thanks councilman mitch any other counselors we should raise any queries or speak against motion uh council honor yes mr mayor look um i 'd like to speak against you i 'll cancel honor just your microphone please mr mayor i 'd like to uh speak against the motion in part and first of all i 'd like to congratulate all the participants in the eat safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program that has been successful in some ways and it has been lacking in others but what i want to say is that the businesses that have participated have been very intrepid in their um working towards goals within their own business and i 've witnessed some of these businesses that have gone above and beyond in my opinion to comply with the star rating program in the eat safe there 's some businesses that have been very very attentive to all the rules in the program and and uh they 've achieved that five-star rating and maintained it throughout the years that this program has operated there are some people that in business that have still participated and maybe uh achieved a four star but it has uh promoted a very good uh practice amongst food businesses uh throughout the region those ones that have continued to work hard to excel have promoted businesses that are recognized right across the country and i know especially in my town of jinjin that 's on the bruce highway there 's people that regularly visit five-star rated businesses there every time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exceptional in the way that they maintain their uh their premises i 'm concerned mr mayor that there 'll be a 20 reduction in the benefit that they achieve or that they have achieved through the five-star rating they will lose 20 percent to the new um think food safe program and i think it 's somewhat um is a slap in the face for those businesses that have worked till late in the evenings cleaning their premises doing repairs that they 'll feel that they 've been reduced back to an average rating so mr mayor i would have liked some more consideration given to those uh um eat safe businesses that have contributed to our community to our profile in the food industry for the last six years and i don 't think that this program does the concern is as well that the fees and charges with our trade waste and other fees and charges that are appropriate to food businesses there 's a risk that they may rise as well and i realize that we have uh discounted uh through the covered year those charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's those loadings that make it very difficult for a small trader a small trader to continue so on those um concerns mr mayor i 'm not in favour of this part of the um the new policy the reduction of 20 on their regulatory charge and hence i 'm going to vote against it on those principles thank you mr mayor thanks uh thanks cancer honor uh council um or any other councils who speak in relation to matter no councilor mitchell did you want to speak or go straight to the vote no thank you mr mayor go straight to the bank yeah thanks councillor mitchell uh so i 'll now put the uh the mata to the vote always in favor days against his uh council uh honor against thanks councillors the next item of business is item n2 i again call councillor mitchell thank you mr may thanks cancer and two the council endorsed a systematic inspection program for identifying unregistered dogs in the council area under the provisions of the local government act 2009 and the animal management dogs and cats act 2008 to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ october 2021 number two of the recommendation public notices be published advising of the commencement of the systematic inspection program and the requirement for dog owners to register their dog or dogs number three of the recommendation that an ongoing annual dog registration follow-up program be introduced in 2022 that 's it yeah uh it 's kind of uh thanks councilman you can have a second of place uh secondary council bar tells uh councillor mitchell you speak further in relation to the motion yes i would please mr maye thank you drug registrations and poor uh management of dogs by unfortunately their owners has resulted in a lot of problems for council so dog registration is a requirement under the queensland 's animal management cats and dogs act 2008 the act dog registration and responsible dog ownership are two key purposes of the act each council must administer and enforce the provisions of the act in its area most councils conduct some type of annual animal registration inspection or media program to ensure up-to-date dog registration or an end owner information is maintained failure to register as dog is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council has not issued fines if the owner registers their dog within a two-week period this practice may be leading to a situation where many dog owners simply wait until they are found so council may need to issue fines the last systematic inspection program for dog registration happened in 2014. importantly since the last systematic inspection program where five to seven thousand unregistered dogs were identified the number of registered dogs has declined at the same time the total number of dogs in the region has increased as at the 10th of may 2021 over four thousand of the sixteen thousand currently registered dogs have not been renewed the community expects dogs are contained on their land and don 't bark excessively and the number of crms about dogs have been steadily increasing with over 60 percent being about unregistered dogs between february 2020 and february 2021 346 of the 648 dogs that were impounded that 's 54 were unregistered placing a significant burden on council 's resources the costa council of impounding an unregistered dog that 's transporting cleaning feeding administering medication publishing photos fielding inquiries release fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered dogs and so the community is currently bearing the cost for dealing with unregistered dogs this report proposes that a systematic inspection program including community public notices be commenced to ensure that all dogs are registered and that the additional registration fees be used to improve animal management thank you mr may thank you council mitchell for uh that uh presentation any other councils wish to raise any queries or speak against the motion no i 'll now put the uh the matter to the vote always in favor goes against no so moved the next item of business before going to it is uh item zero uh council uh haberman you uh have identified a uh possible conflict yeah thank you mr mayor and i apologize i i hadn 't declared that earlier i don 't know why that slipped through my mind anyway pursuant to section 150 eq of the local government act 2009 i wish to form the meeting that i have a declarable conflict of interest in relation to item 01 that 's the apex cane to coral fun run the nature of that conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coral

Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",7669,apology today is in canberra on ilga business the agenda 's been updated with those four late items that were sent out separately but we 'll deal with them in the order they now appear on the amended agenda and also there i 'm aware there 's a couple of councillors uh wish to declare conflicts that they 'll be putting on the table at the ordinary meeting uh the week after next so just go around to the table and just get any record of conflicts first thank you mr ceo i 'll be declaring a conflict in item 01 i am a life member of childress apex even though children 's apex no longer exists but because apex bundaberg is the partner in the sponsorship i 'll be declaring a conflict and asking to stay in the meeting thanks council trevor jason all right council mcphee thank you casa barnes council mclaughlin nasa hamilton council cooper council metro council um okay i 'm not just tidying the wording up with christine prior to the ordinary meeting on that one cancel your month might just tidy the wording up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay all right that 's fine thanks councillor i might just check with christine whether that refers to the executive leadership team or senior staff generally um thank you all right um we 'll move on into the agenda the first item is the scripture union chaplaincy breakfast which i 'll speak to councillors would be aware that we had recently decided that we would have the chaplaincy breakfasts again in 2021 obviously they were put on hold last year because of covert look unfortunately we 're in the middle of a restructure in the area that normally would hold that chaplaincy service um and we 've got two vacant staff positions at the moment that we 're currently advertising there 's also still some residual issues to do with covert in the way in which food has to be served what we 're proposing instead of having the chaplaincy breakfast is to make a donation in lieu of that directly to the scripture union to be used for school chaplaincy purposes so questions or comments council mcphee i 'm we 're recommending five thousand dollars council i might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of that are absorbed by the council to actually raise that funding yeah council i haven 't been sorry i had a question too i was just going to ask the same question thank you council mcphee [Music] uh look if i was taking a guess sitting here i 'd say it 's probably not as much as the 5 000 that 's recommended that we could um we could certainly look to try and um get you a figure before the ordering meeting that would be great thank you i mean it 's up the council 's at liberty to alter that figure should they should they wish to all right um any other comments or questions no uh the next item is the mou between bundaberg council and qut i 'll also do that one because ben is not here today sorry i 'll just tap down um so this is a a memo you only actually turn her into with eut to look at trying to i guess access research grants working with them in a collaborative way to look at things like the challenger centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mou is not binding it is just that i think it 's a good opportunity for the council to broaden its reach into the education field the higher education field we 've obviously got a good relationship with cqu and have worked with them in the past as we 're currently doing particularly with the agtech hub but this is another opportunity to just broaden that reach happy to take questions or comments all right okay we 'll move on and the next item is the financial summary and i 'll ask simon who 's the acting cfo to present that report welcome simon financial summary as of the 1st of march 2021 uh recurrent revenues largely ahead of schedule fees and charges interest at the moment and some of our land sales at our concuna in particular states are ahead of where we expected the one variance there in the graph figure one is in relation to the general fund and that is around the advance of the financial assistance grant of which we 're not quite sure yet whether we 'll get this financial year in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are slightly behind budget however there are some planned service relocations with some significant infrastructure projects planned in the next couple of months and they will flow through to the children 's services budget there couple expansion at the reporting date uh expanded 44 of the program um historically there 's significant expenditure in the last quarter so you can see there in figure 3 expected increase in cash outflows over the next few months cash as that 's uh the reporting date uh was 136.9 million that was slightly ahead of of forecast you 'll see that start to trend down as that capital outlays in the next couple of months is referenced rates outstanding at the end of february were 54.8 million that was during the due date period which closed on the 8th of march the rates outstanding currently are around the same as this time last year any questions no questions thanks simon the next item is council policy review and christine will be presenting the next four items in governance welcome christine um item g1 is in relation to the council uh policy review so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies in accordance with best practice or changes in legislation given that council resolved and has now appointed mayor 's chief of staff councillor advisor we 've updated the suite of policies to include with the acceptable request guidelines policy so that the counsellor advisor has the ability to request information about the council there 's new definitions in that policy regarding the councillor advisor executive leadership team and other updates throughout that document the media relations policy has been updated as well given the restructure in the communications department to refer to the communications manager rather than the executive officer communications and the related parties document um has been updated as well that policy had additions to different staff who are able to access the information from the related party disclosures that were made and other grammatical changes the councillor code of conduct it 's proposed that council 's own policy be repealed as councillors are aware the code of conduct is a code that the minister makes under the local government act so it 's proposed that our website be updated to remove the code of conduct which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department 's website to the code of conduct they 'll also be on the website an update to the mayor 's chief of staff and the code of conduct that applies to that role christine comments or questions uh the next item 's g2 which is in relation to the audit and risk management committee minutes so the committee met on the 7th of october 2020 um and the minutes are attached to that report for councillors information and the recommendation is that the minutes for the audit and risk committee meeting held on the 7th of october 2020 be received and noted by the council any questions on the minutes thank you the next item is g3 which is in regard to the sale of lots in concur waters estate as councillors are aware the market has been moving quite substantially and all lots in stage one are now under contract so the final lots are 31 and 32 there and they 've been presented their market value we also have salem staged two presently there 's four properties that are left in that estate which was released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's four lots remaining so the other lots are there um so there 's 80 77 76 74 71 70 69 64 63 and 62 in stage 2 and it 's proposed that the resolution or exception in the local government regulation be applied given that the lots have previously been offered for sale through auction or tender and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the contracts and finalize those sales thanks christine any comments questions counselor barnes thank you there 's been a lot of activity with ken kerner some time of stag stagnation i suppose um do we know what 's actually sparked this is it through our marketing or it 's through a response from covert the whole property market has moved um substantially talking to other colleagues properties aren 't staying on the market they 're being listed and sold within a couple of days so um i think that 's what 's uh this just seems to be a major move in the property market at the moment which has come from covert i don 't know whether it 's people diversifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money but there 's a lot of movement at the moment yeah i might disagree with that i think also the fact that they 're very large blocks and i think that 's also partly a response to code people are looking for bit of space and just anecdotally from the people that i 've talked to and i 'm sure counselor trevor has two that are bought out there they seem to be people that are probably a couple of years off retirement and looking to build the retirement house and i guess as you get more and more in the area gives other people more confidence to actually become part of the neighborhood exactly and i think one of the things you 're noticing is they pass through the council here they 're sold two weeks later the grass has been cleared off they 're not buying them sitting on them there 's houses actually going on them there 's about seven going up at the moment yeah really good uh sorry councilman mcfee do you have a question uh and i 'll just also while we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 've previously advised you we 're currently doing some investigations for a stage three um through some consultants so we 'll be reporting back through council at some point as to what that uh what that looks like um okay nothing else on that one no mitch 's gonna do the cloud thanks mitch moment in the sun uh morning everybody uh here today to seek endorsement for a specialized supplier with amazon web services uh brief history amazon web services were chosen as council 's preferred cloud platform in 2019 after an rfq uh given our growth in the space over the last couple of years it 's become disadvantageous for us to move uh so here today to recommend that council enter into an agreement with amazon web services for cloud hosting providing without written quotes pursuant to section 235 local government reg this arrangement could be made for five years if possible thanks mitch uh questions or comments all good thank you uh councillors the next item is h1 that 's in regard to a renewal of a lease for optus so optus presently have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since expired and it 's proposed that a new lease be entered into for approximately five years with an expiry date of no later than the 30th of november 2026 the rent will be full market value and on council 's terms and conditions and it 's proposed that the exception contained in 236 1c 3 be applied given that it 's a renewal of a lease to an existing tenant and that the ceo be authorised to enter into a lease with optus for part of that parcel of land thanks christine comments or questions council honor questions mr chairman in regards to the positioning of their assets am i believe they 're attached to the tower so it is for the radio equipment at the top and they do have a parcel that 's down the bottom for a lease area where their little hut is with all their communications equipment in so there was a review done recently for water towers and um as part of that review uh there will be other clauses that we 're looking to make sure that council is protected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they 're required to access the their equipment especially at the top of the tower from external rather than internally from the water tower thanks christine any other questions or comments thanks yeah so h2 uh is a renewal of a lease to optus and this one is actually for the children 's water tower so again um it 's proposed that that lease be entered into for an expiry date no later than the 30 of june 2025 and again the exception contained in the local government regulation be applied given that it 's a renewal of a lease to an existing tenant and again that the ceo be authorised to enter into that lease with optus for part of that parcel of land questions comments it 's all good too thank you thanks christine thanks christine um open for development michael a request from j m to vary an infrastructure agreement has a familiar ring to it um as you see from the report before you the council last considered the infrastructure agreement for the burner open development incentives relating to the approved shopping centre at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report that resolution is there in particular just draw your attention to item c of the resolution that uh the substantial commencement um the date for substantial commencement of the development uh be amended to 31st july 2021 since that time you can see either just before council resolved that or after the applicants made a number of applications in relations proposal the first being to subdivide the the land so that stage 1 and 2b are located on a separate lot with what we understand be the intention to sell that to a developer who will then proceed with that development the second part of that is related to the subdivision but because of that subdivision and the introduction of a new lot it was necessary to make uh changes uh to the original material change of use approval and so that was lodged on the 7th of december effectively through the passage of time in dealing with those two applications the developer is now seeking three amendments to their existing draft infrastructure agreement first is to add the reconfiguration of a lot application into the infrastructure agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that should the developer complete the substantial civil works that are necessary for that particular development by the substantial commencement date then that will count uh towards achieving the first requirement of the agreement to get the incentives uh the second then is noting that the period of time that 's elapsed they 're seeking a three-month extension uh to the substantial commencement date to the 30th of november uh 2021 and third is a sort of a minor point they want to clarify that to get the discount they only need pay the reduced infrastructure charges prior to the commencement of the use and it 's the use that the incentives relate to in assessing those things in summary the adding the role to the agreement is uh something that 's consistent with our council 's original intent the works that we 're talking about uh which will largely form the construction of the extension of san lucia boulevard and associated drainage works what works up a condition for stage one of the material change of use uh in any event and will just be brought forward um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real change to the agreement in that regard in relation to the extension of time i note that the officers have been engaging with the developer to work through the issues related to i guess fine-tuning their proposal for to make it ready for sale and progress it to the construction stage the developer has also been taking substantial steps uh including getting necessary approvals from department transport main roads as well as progressing detailed civil works design including the bulk earth works necessary to construct the site uh and lastly the the last change uh is also very minor um the standard template agreement that this agreement was based on um if you recall under the open for development we were incentivizing um reconfiguring a lot applications as well and the template just had our either all clause um you know that you could then pick up depending on the type of development you insert you know you had applied for the incentives uh yeah none of the other developments that we incentivize actually included both are reconfig and a mcu so given that the mcu component of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy enough to just drop out that sort of you know clause relating to the rol and the intent will still be the same as um what was approved originally so councils that 's uh in essence the the request and the the recommendation is that those changes be agreed to thanks michael uh comments or questions okay thank you um gavin food safe dogs n1 uh so as council 's aware uh we 've been using the eat safe program for our food licensing since about 2014. it 's a licensed product so to some extent it 's relatively rigid a bit inflexible if we want to seek changes and so we 've effectively reviewed that and looked at is there a better way for us to do it we think there is so the officers have developed what they 're calling think food safe which is a similar sort of program but obviously if it 's our own provides far greater flexibility gets away from the current star rating system which is a bit confusing i mean changes some of the discount arrangements that were currently in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're proposing to change the intention would be that if a council adopts this i would start a communication process with all of our food licensed licensed food premises with the view that when the next food licensing comes around at the end of the financial year they would convert to the think food safe program so happy to take any questions if there are any counselors there 's an intention is there not to reduce the benefits to the five-star ratings the current um that is correct so the discount currently under the eat safe programs that they get a 50 reduction on their food license under the proposed think safe program if they met the requirements there they would get a 30 reduction um effectively we don 't have um as many five-star premises so one of the issues that we came up against was that if you comply with the current food hygiene regulations which is the requirement legislated you effectively got a three-star rating you had to do extra work and put in extra documentation to achieve a five-star a lot of businesses didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the legislation you 're compliant and so the idea with the think safe food program is that one we 're going to recognize compliance with the legislation as a big tick as opposed to the process where it was three out of five stars so a lot of food businesses weren 't showing um their star ratings because even though they were compliant it looked like they were average under the current system where that changes under the new system but there is a change in the discount arrangement so the maximum discount you can achieve under this proposed program is 30 as opposed to 50 but we expect more of those currently three star rated um eat safe premises will achieve a discount that they wouldn 't have got before under this new program so there 's a bit of balance i guess that those were five star will not get as great a benefit but those that are three star were compliant will receive a bit of a benefit so included in the fees and that 's probably why we 're looking at fees i mean one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time between inspections and a lot can happen in that time so you know you 're changing staff and some of those organizations don 't have the same level of food hygiene training and they 've effectively got a rating that says that they 're good for all this period but we haven 't been there for two years and so what we 're effectively doing was we 're going in um for some of those for 18 months anyway what we were finding and even in the 18 month period there 'd been a change for some of them in their standard of compliance so we think two years has just been too long um and a lot happens in that particular time so we 're reducing it down to 18 months but the fees will reflect that so don 't get charged additionally it 's part of that it 's incorporating their fees okay counselor having them uh they don 't get any under the current systems no because they can still achieve the 30 discount um what it 'll mean is that in some cases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of those i mean there are some exceptions obviously the larger chain food stores but a lot of them are just mum and dad businesses so the requirements to do the additional paperwork and registers that were required under the eat safe program to achieve five stars was just too much work for them so and and effectively under the legislation as long as they comply with the food hygiene regulations they get their licence which under the eat safe program meant that they were just a three-star you had to do a whole loop of extra work if you want to get the five-star as i said there weren 't a lot of businesses that decided to do that because it was too much of a demand it 's not their core business they 're really into serving food not doing paperwork so um i guess a lot of the feedback that we 've got um in reviewing this was from the food premises about there 's no value to them in in putting extra work in to get a five star um people confuse it with um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on one of the travel sites and you get a five star um about how good the experience is this was a food hygiene star rating so people thought that if you were three star maybe the food wasn 't good um when really that 's not what it 's saying it was a it 's a reflection against the legislation um and to go above and beyond that in regards to food hygiene it didn 't talk about what the taste of the food was like or the quality of the chef and those sort of things so thank you thanks again um any other questions or comments no okay we 'll move on to dogs okay the next one counsellors is um n2 a systematic inspection program for dog registration so um as we discussed at a recent consultation meeting uh one of the biggest issues we 've got um is the fact that we 've got a higher level of unregistered dogs currently in the region so that is costing both council and the community money every time we uh get one of these dogs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner is so we 've got to feed it and water it look after it vet check it and do all those things in the hope that the owner will come forward that might take a day or a couple of days in the meantime we 're bearing that cost and therefore on behalf of the community whereas if someone 's got a registered dog that 's collected our guys can usually immediately contact the dog owner and in a lot of cases the dog won 't even touch our pound it 'll go directly back to the dog owner if it 's got out and we can deal directly with the dog owner but we 're also finding that the majority of the incidents we have so the majority of the complaints we receive when we go and do the investigation majority of those dogs are actually unregistered as well so it means that those people who are currently doing the right thing and registering their dogs are paying for and subsidising those who aren 't and that 's where the majority of our complaints are coming from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to ensure that we get compliance so effectively do a door-to-door inspection program for dog registrations we did one back in 2015 i think it was 2014. what we found then was there was a significant increase in dog registrations as a result of that at the time we went from 8 000 up to about 13 000 dogs during that program we expect that while we currently got about 16 000 registered dogs we 'll get a similar sort of uplift and certainly the hope is that that will reduce the demand on the pound we 'll reduce the cost to the community of looking after these dogs that are unregistered because we were able to get them to the registered owners one of the benefits of the dog registration program is that if your dog is registered and happens to get out um we provide the the first time it arrives at the pound uh it 's free so yeah effectively um so it 's free but it 's covered in your registration whereas that 's obviously not the case for unregistered dogs it takes a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners um and in regards to investigations particularly where we might have a dog attack much easier for us to find on our system if we 've got a description of a particular dog in a particular breed to try to find if there 's one of those particular dogs in the area otherwise we effectively have to door knock if it 's unregistered to try to find it and that adds time and effort which obviously then the community pays for so the proposal is that we 'd do an inspection program it would kick off um from the first of may through to the 31st of august the intention then is that usually our registration period runs from august so we 'd effectively line that up with our current registration program with the hope that you know we 'd get the majority of dogs in the region registered which then hopefully will reduce the burden on the pound on staff and then obviously the cost to the community at the moment in dealing with unregistered dogs happy to take any questions again through the acting chair um just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random or will you know that dogs are registered at that address and there 's no need to go to that address to um do an inspection yeah so the intention is that we will print out all of our current dog registration so we 'll know houses where the dogs currently are registered and obviously go to those where there aren 't um any registrations and do a door-to-door inspection program obviously we see there 's a dog there and there 's nothing registered on our on our register um to say that there 's no current dogs registered this site would then obviously have a chat to the owner and find out the details and then proceed from there sorry around the table uh council cooper yes thank you much to see you um just my question relates to how we could uh simplify the process and the amount of people or dogs that haven 't been re-registered after we gave them some leniency we would have those on record already and could we shortcut the system by simply going straight to them and uh asking them why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewals we don 't have renewal uh we they 're automatically followed up once the expiry date has passed so the admin officers then contact those people find out if they 've still got a dog has gone to the wrong address with the renewal so we already do that process and following up those that we had on the system this is for those that currently aren 't in the system at all in saying that the ones that we would be really after because we 'd be on top of that other situation would be all new registrations i take it yes yep uh council barnes had a question yeah thanks kevin um the cost of managing um dogs within the region is absolutely huge to council and when you see so many people with dogs that they refuse to register or fail to register it comes back to an attitude in the community my belief what um what 's the fine for an unregistered dog at the moment gavin 266 260. is it the intention of this program that people will be fined if they don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to register the dog these as about the potential to possibly put in a new dog application fee so that um you know in most cases for every other thing that we do usually there 's an application fee and then an annual renewal fee and we 're looking at as a possibility but we 'll also consider um fine so prior to us kicking this off we 'll probably come back and have a chat to councils about the process we 'll take last time when we did it we gave people 14 days in which to register the other issue with the fine you could say that effectively we 've incentivized people who haven 't um and we 've had to go and find them um find them not find them find them in the first place to do this and then we 're then giving an extra 14 days to comply when they 're having all this time so it 's probably um something we 'll come back to you with just prior to us officially kicking off to talk about the the strategy we use i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong on this because it really is a huge cost to council takes up a lot of staff time a lot of resources and it 's simply done by people who um flaunt the system fill out the system um and refuse point blank to register their dogs and the last um systematic inspection program that we had as you said was 14 and 15 was quite successful a lot of people did take the responsible action of of registering their dogs and hopefully it 'll happen again and um it 's it 's it 's a user-paced system thanks council bonds casa mcphee um i was just wondering if we 've how we um compare as a regional council to other areas if we 've looked at that and if there are other councils that have much better registration rates have we looked at what best practices are to see what they 're doing or is it or is it sort of this is the case across the whole state uh it 's probably a broad brush statement but yes i guess there is a level of non-compliance across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to as we talked to some of the other councils they do tend to do uh an annual or a bi-annual inspection program for things for the same reasons um and i 'm aware that um you know they don 't do that for a number of means it 's either door-to-door they do a targeted program effectively where they think there 's particular suburbs maybe in their regions whether it 's they think there 's a through their stats they 're getting a high level of dog complaints but can 't see a high level of dog registration um and so targeting particular areas so um the idea with this i guess is that we will over time hopefully reduce the number of unregistered i mean i guess the key is telling stat in that is if you have a look that between february 2020 and february 2021 346 of the 648 dogs we impounded were unregistered so 54 um that would give an indication of the level of um unregistered dogs out in the area i think so um we expect that you know there 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again be registered and as i said you know the intention is that that will flow on to be to save us money and save the community money because you know we 've got to a point where we built a new pound probably only four years ago now that pound was more than double the size of the old one and we have filled it regularly which we shouldn 't be doing um purely and simply because we 've got unregistered dogs that we can 't find owners for so so i sent an email out told councillors just the other week to sort of say that um we were sending sms messages out as well so just as another strategy um that did improve um the number of renewals but we 're also following up by with a phone call to every single person who hasn 't renewed their dog registration so sorry counselor happened we 'll get back around here again sorry just one other little question there 54 of impounded ones were unregistered so numbers-wise what what what are those numbers around 56 out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes mr chairman look um it seems to me that the great concern is the cost of the regulation that we have taken on in relation to dogs but um there 's a lot of other animals that go into that town as well other than dogs in relation to cats which is a large number cat 's not so much not without being flippant we don 't get too many cat attacks so whereas we get over 250 dog attacks a year so you know effectively five a week um and that 's and remembering every one of those is going to result in some sort of you know action in regards to us either declaring the dog menacing or dangerous um and then going through a process where we then have to go and inspect the property to make sure it can be suitably contained and do all those things so the average dog declaration probably takes under the current legislation about a month to complete because we have to make a notice of the fact that we intend to declare uh the owners got appeal rights two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the outcome the investigation then two when we 're proposing to declare the dog they also have an appeal right there so effectively it takes us a month for every one of those dog attacks to get a result and so as i said 250 whereas cats are usually the issue of dump cats predominantly or where we 've had stray cats we don 't get many cat complaints generally speaking so it 's a very small percentage compared to dogs thanks again councillor trevor i think unfortunately the only way we keep on top of this is we 're going to have to have regular patrols because people coming and going in in rental homes itinerant and that dogs come in those people aren 't aware and they don 't follow up and unless we follow up it 's just not going to happen and don 't believe because you have a registered dog at a premise that you don 't have to go there because some people have four dogs and they register one and they have others so if you 're going to do the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to make sure that everyone 's aware that it is going to be ongoing because otherwise people slip back into bad habits and we 're back with people getting bitten by dogs or annoyed by barking other questions comments no okay thanks kev one um so the change of place a partnership and sponsorship green application for the apex came the coral fun run um so councils are probably aware that apex took over um they came to coral it used to be operated through the gladstone ports corporation and jason out there used to take it over but they 've sort of handed across responsibility to the apex club and so they 're proposing to to run the event this year and seeking um council 's support through our partnership and sponsorships program traditionally we 've supplied ten thousand dollars towards that um as a goal level sponsor uh and they 've sort of similar level of sponsorship for the the um uh current the 2021 event which will be held in august so happy to take any questions if there are anything we might have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just oh so is this the table they 've got their council you 're referring to on page six no seven um on the table at the back it says marketing advertising printing five right okay we might have to clarify that with them prior to the ordering meeting to see which figures correct or whether they 've there 's some other amounts that add up to the five that 's not shown in the last table i 'll take that one on notice definitely it 's definitely an anomaly you 're right um any other question or comments council barnes yeah just uh note as the ceo that this um is what we refer to as an iconic event it actually it 's not covered in a report but actually brings people from outside the region attracts them to to come here and um and spend money and it 's good to see it back it 's it 's very very successful and apex is certainly a well-respected organization and i know that we we have actually uh budgeted the ten thousand dollars for the event thanks council barnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that um that ten thousand dollar figure against the five all right okay council 's next item is o2 uh smarty grants request so smart events effectively is an online program to manage um grant processes so it 's used by a number of uh councils probably considered best practice at the moment state government use it for their grant processes so it 's more customer friendly historically what we did with our grants was people sent in emails effectively with hard application forms smarter grants automates a fair bit of that makes them popular particular fields ensures that we get full information which is one of the issues we 've always had with our grant applications is that forms can be part filled out or not filled out completely at all then submitted and we 've then had to go back and chase people up for information so the smarty grants process makes that easier because they can 't submit it until they put all the required fields in it 's easier to use so the experience from the customer or the grant applicant 's point of view is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the assessment process easier for us um as well and so but it 's a it 's a product that we need to an i.t product that we need to pay a license fee for so the license fee is 12 500 per annum we distribute just under four hundred thousand dollars worth of grants a year um under our community grants program um one of the things we 'll be looking at potentially is expanding smarter grants into all our also our rdf program which is about another ninety thousand dollars worth of grants a year just to improve both those processes from a processing point of view for us and obviously from the customer experience for the applicant on the other end so i 'm happy to take any questions thanks gavin looking at some other council 's websites i think it 's become apparent it 's probably going to be best practice for most local governments in queensland uh any comments or questions council mcphee i 'd just like to say um i 've used the smartie grants thing with applying for grants through the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very user friendly simple shows you prompts you if you 've missed something so i think it 's a good thing just a question in regard to the membership of the committee that 's recommended here because i understand that we had done away with having a council a representative that 's a different kind of different one okay sorry uh yeah we 're not onto that one yet sorry no other questions on that one no okay good that we 're running an efficient meeting now council honor yeah we 've got to hear that okay i will speed up counselling um the um the next item is r1 uh bundaberg region sport and recreation reference advisory group so when council first met at the first meeting and appointed representations to all the committees we decided that this would be an advisory committee and so that meant that we 've had to change the terms of reference just to reflect that decision that was made at the ordinary meeting in october 2016. we recently called for expression of interest because the current membership their terms have expired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so we 've gone out for an expression of interest received applications for the roles and the um the persons who have been or proposed to be selected uh in the report there so councillor haberman has the portfolio chair uh geordi lasalles who 's the branch manager dave field who 's our support and rec coordinator linda klein smith who 's represented from the state government department of sport mr bradley grogan and mr peter bock who are um communion support reps uh mr knoll stitt and mr gills simon gills who are both education queensland reps so happy to take any questions yes honor and then council haven 't been here mr chairman back in order again um look as i understood we we had sort of suspended the position of a councillor on that sports committee previously is that committee i think councillor honour we 've always had this one going um there 's always been a councillor on it so council usually chairs it so thank you council haven 't probably should i have declared a conflict of interest on this as i 'm no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a council committee yeah sorry i was just wanting to i didn 't think so but i wanted that confirmed thank you uh any other comments or questions no thanks gav uh there 's no other late items no we 've got one item in confidential so if i could uh thank the gallery for their attendance and we 'll move in to consider that one item thank you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

AUS,QLD,Bundaberg Regional Council,Bundaberg Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/user/BundabergRC,Bundaberg Regional Council - Briefing Meeting - 17 February 2021,gCUoUlatIZ0,20210216,2531.92,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",3304,everybody and uh welcome to the briefing meeting for the february council meeting uh i have an apology received this morning from councillor barnes who won 't be here for the briefing meeting or the consultation session that follows the first item we have today is a specialized supplier arrangement for id consulting uh ben thank you to um on to the community um the the tools also a bit of a standard across uh local government in australia there 's up to 250 other councils that use this so provides a consistent source of information that that investors and the community can use across the country to compare our regions when they 're looking at the numbers so uh that 's the reason for seeking the resolution today uh thanks ben uh questions or comments no okay thank you uh the next item is a financial summary up to the 1st of february simon um recent charges are currently more than year-to-date budget some of those variances are expected with the timing of licences and renewals others are due to the current height and development activity in the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is expected with the advance of the financial assistance grant not expected to later in the financial year we won 't know whether that advance is forthcoming until the federal budget is handed down later in the financial year and also council has currently settled uh several parcels of land uh this financial year year to date we 've got uh 23 parcels that have either settled or unconditionally settled in the near future the reason for the variance in the recurrent revenue in the general fund is due to that financial assistance grant advance that i referenced earlier in terms of a current expenditure um the variance is there for each of the funds is largely due to the timing delivery of non-capital projects and one-off expenses throughout the year um and also to something worth noting that finance costs are lower than our utah budget and that 's primarily due to the water write-offs for the first half of the financial year being lower than budget in terms of capital project cash flows council has delivered 38 of this year 's program which is slightly behind our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment although um the current expansion is less than 30 percent majority of the plant for this year has been commissioned and we 're just waiting delivery on those items uh cash out the first of february was 122.6 million um that has decreased slightly since the last report we 'll obviously expect that will increase during the next month with the issue of the rates the variance there on the cash profile is primarily due to the increased fee income and also the delivery of the capital program is referenced earlier uh lastly rates have obviously been issued and are due on the 8th of march the balance outstanding at the time the report was generated was 79.7 million that 's largely in line with previous years as you know that was trending a bit behind where we were due to the cavity measures that council put in place that 's largely realigned with the application of interest in january any questions thanks simon um we now have a number of items relating to the sale of lots christine with nicole christine good morning councillors item g1 is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in stage 1 which was previously offered for auction councils proposing to apply a resolution over lots 34 and 35. um 35 was previously subject to a resolution made by council however that contract has been validly terminated by the buyer on the 21st of january and subsequently a new buyer has been uh located through a real estate agent for that lot um stage two sales there 's three lots a lot 73 75 and 61. uh stage two as you 'll know um has been offered previously by tender all of the offers that are presented to council from the buyers are for market value and it 's recommended that council apply the exception contained in section 2361ai of the local government regulation to the disposal of those five lots and that the chief executive officer be authorised to enter into the contracts and attend to all items to finalize those sales thanks christine comments or questions council trainer uh mr ceo how many lots are left in stage one now and so is it one or two stage one 's completely sold now councillor trevor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these there 's one lot we withdrew from the market yeah for the signage which may at some point go back on the entrance yep stage two these three will make six under contract sixteen there 's sixteen that are under contract that 's in stage two and in uh stage one um with what 's being finalized now and 15 are actually available for um sale in stage two so there 's 15 lots presently left there 's three in negotiation and once with the ceo for signing so there 's lots of movement i 've just sent counsellors an updated table yeah um so that you 've got it available i thought it was better coming at the briefing meeting than the end of the month thank you so you 've got that information thanks christopher uh no other questions nope next one uh item g2 is in regard to a sale of a property at burn borough boulevard in branyon it 's lot 192 on rp 215 this offi this property has previously been offered through tender or auction and councils received an offer to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again this is another property that was uh previously subject to a resolution however that contract was validly terminated by the buyer in january and a subsequent buyer has been located from a real estate agent so it 's recommended that council apply the exception contained in section 2361ai of the local government regulation and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the contract and attend to all items to finalize that sale thanks christine questions or comments uh the next item is item g3 uh that 's in relation to a sale in heritage oaks estate in childers it 's for lot 22. those properties were previously offered by auction and they were passed in some time ago and an offer has been made to council for market value for the purchase of that property and it 's recommended again that the council apply the same section into section 236 of the local government regulation to the disposal given that it 's previously been offered through auction and that the ceo be authorised to enter into a contract and attend to all items to finalize that sale thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale of lot 16 abington road abington this property has previously been offered for sale and was passed in and again councils received an offer for market value for the sale of that property and the same exception under the local government regulation is proposed given that it 's previously been offered again through auction or tender and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the contract and finalize that sale of the property comments or questions thank you thanks christine uh stuart good morning councillors we 've got two reports that are quite similar the first in line relates to brands of trucks that we own volvo isuzu ud and mac we 've got quite a few of them in our fleet can land diesel repairs are the only authorized parts service and repair agent for those brands in the bundaberg region this report we are seeking your approval to deal directly with ken land diesel repairs for the provision of part service and repairs for those brands of trucks without first seeking competitive tenders from other suppliers in accord with section 2 235 b of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar just uh different brands oh sorry yeah i didn 't go through the conflicts at the start uh council mitchell did email me a conflict earlier about h2 no i 'm not another british i 've already got it in writing so so cancel is this report 's very similar in nature to the previous one slightly different though in that four for i know trucks we 've got we previously had an arrangement for wide land group to be the service agent but uh now braldery kemp diesel has been appointed as the the local rep so we 're seeking again to apply section 235 b of the local government regulation for us to be able to enter into arrangement with paltry camp diesel for supply vinyl trucks parts service and repairs without first inviting written tenders council mcphee good question are we um switching to those stuart because they are local and obviously it 's going to save money not having to drive that is that the main reason yes we we i suppose technically we could get competitive quotes from suppliers or agents in other centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleet for repairs it 's critical that we turn it around as quickly as possible so we really need a local agent someone who can just down the road that we can deal with straight away as well as being local boy but time is critical in in these cases today is in relation to cancer meeting day um this report is in relation to adoption of the storm water management strategy as you know this has been a significant body of work that 's been underway for quite some time we recently proposed going out to consultation with the community on a draft of the strategy we 've done that we 've received five sec sets of feedback from from the community uh we 've considered each of those submissions and we 've proposed responses that are in the report for uh for your consideration to each of those submissions i haven 't considered each of the submissions we don 't believe that any of them require a further amendment of the strategy so we 're now proposing that number one will respond to each of the submissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council 's stormwater management strategy and releases it to the public uh comments or questions council bartels no this um no it doesn 't is a short answer any other comments or questions no thanks stuart uh next item is a release christine councillors item01 is in regard to a lease disposal of property at the airport it 's a general aviation hangar um clack clack and longmuer the proposed tenant it 's proposed to enter into a new lease for a five year term with a further five year option rent is at market value and it 's proposed that the lease be subject to three percent increases uh the remainder of the terms will be on council standard lease document given that uh the lease is already with the existing tenant it 's proposed to apply the exception to the auction or tender requirement under the section 2361c3 of the local government regulation given that it 's a renewal of a lease to an existing tenant uh any comments or questions counselor haven 't been not yet until no we 'll finish that one okay evan 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o2 is about a lease renewal to bundaberg junior cricket association uh presently the junior qriket association has a lease over kendall 's flats which is 4e boubon street at bundaberg east the land is state owned reserve for park and recreation which councils the trustee of that lease is expiring on the 30th of june 2021 and it 's proposed to enter into a new lease commencing on the 1st of july 2021 for a term of 10 years rent will be at council 's community rate but the lessee will be responsible for their outgoings it 's proposed that rather than the disposal be by tender or auction that um section two three six one b two of the local government regulation be applied given that the disposal is for the purposes of renewing a lease to with a community organization thanks christine uh council haberman just in regard to that item the bundaberg junior qriket association no longer exists that was incorporated into the bundaber cricket association some years ago so i 'd imagine that new lease would be in the name of bundaberg cricket association incorporated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make sure that the correct entity is who the lessee is that exception under the local government regulation can still apply because it uh b2 is to a community organization so even though the name has changed it 's still a community organization so we can still apply that section thank you thank you uh any other questions comments no thanks christine um gavin rodf i 'm dealing with item 03 a regional arts development fund as council 's aware radf is jointly funded between us and state government and usually works on a what we 've asked is actually work on a calendar basis because we covered last year we 're restricting regards to issuing rounds because nothing could effectively happen in that space so recently opened up a round with it closing early this year we received four grant applications under that round and effectively the committee have assessed those and have recommended that to be approved uh they are the city of bundaberg drum corps um for effectively uh their 65th anniversary and bundaberg region limited which is is um bundy tourism um for a project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the sand they 're also seeking funding through another source from queensland government so this the radf funding is contingent on them being successful with that state government funding if they 're unsuccessful then the rad grant will fall away have you take any questions if there are any questions or comments and the next one council number three wants to declare an interest oh yes so i have a declarable interest it 's a long boba i 'm just thought it would be best so in this tender consideration plan it does talk about food and beverage services and so i just wanted to declare that possibly one day in the future we may quote on a event or a job that but i will be choosing to stay in the room thank you thank you thank you council so audemars iv um arts and cultural services uh tender consideration plan i might do just a bit of an explanation about what that means effectively under council 's procurement policy uh where we have any items above two thousand dollars officers are required to get quotes because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um probably classic example is the recent photographic exhibition there are there 's no ability to get a quote from another supplier for that particular service and similarly with most things that happen in arch and cultural services we 've got an artist who wants to put something on there might be some payment for that and it 's not possible to get other quotes so effectively what this tender consideration plan is doing is it 's still working within the parameters of our procurement strategy but allows the flexibility for operational effectiveness of them being uh not required in some cases and they 're sort of highlighted within this report to have to go and get further quotes so we 've gone through this process to ensure that there 's still probity in the process work with the council 's procurement section to ensure that we 're not avoiding or making sure we 're still getting value for money but it just frees up and operationally makes it a little bit easier for the staff in that area to deal with when they tend to have specialist suppliers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm happy to take any questions if there are any questions no thank you we do have a light item which we 've just distributed in a hard copy for another specialised supplier stewart you 're going to do that one i just want to apologize for the lateness of this report uh the reason it 's presented to you now is that uh we really need a decision on this enabled for us to enable us to complete this program this this financial year uh the background is that we 've tried to keep a consistent style of plus shelter in the cbd area from an aesthetics and practical point of view there is one supplier of of the style that we 're currently using which is gossip park and street furniture we 're proposing to enter into an arrangement with them as a specialised supplier rather than inviting quotes from other suppliers in order to keep that consistent uh presentation these particular shelters are about about a quarter of our program for this year so the other three quarters of the program would go out to competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program we 're proposing to do exclusively with gotti uh questions or comments counselor um so the sections on the comments under the chief legal officers section uh relate to the words that are actually in the regulation uh that 's that 's the whole of the clause it 's in the local government regulation not every word that 's in that clause applies in every case in this case the it would be impractical impractical is the key word here it would be impractical for us to seek tenders when there is only one supply that we 're uh we 're looking to to deal with uh there isn 't anything confidential you 're quite correct thanks uh any other comments or questions sorry sorry about it are you you said that it relates to the quarter of the project is the three quarters is that like the concrete slabs and all of that sort of no sorry um it 's the number of shelters so we we are this year going to be installing quite a number of shelters uh scattered throughout uh the location it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of the number uh that we want to use this particular style thank you i was just going to make the point that could you imagine how hegely pigley it would look if you had five different types of shelters all over the place and and so some consistency in your cbd in particular is desirable residents have been very happy with those shelters uh any other questions or comments no other late items that 's it all right thanks everybody that will conclude the briefing meeting okay so noted thank you and you 'd already give an advance notice of that you,"(-24.8661482,

Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",4930,okay uh welcome everybody to uh the briefing meeting for the uh for the may council meeting uh i 'll start with two conflicts of interest i 've received uh one from council of honour in relation to h2 and one from councillor mcphee in relation to t1 are there any other conflicts that councils have council haven 't been conflict of interest in relation to item r2 in that i 'm a life member of bundaberg cricket association but i 'll be planning um hello councillors see fit uh okay any other councillors have conflicts uh all right did uh councillor honor and council mafia just want to highlight what your conflicts are yes thank you council honor council mcphee thank you mine 's for t1 land held in trust for religious purposes i will be um leaving the meeting i was a member of one of the churches for 13 years and i attended three or four times weekly i 'm heavily involved in all areas of the organisation i wasn 't aware of this consultation because there wasn 't owners names or photographs of the building when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council haven 't been sorry if that 's a different item number that will need to be changed on the attendance sheet i put down r2 on the attendance okay we 'll change that to t3 thank you all right now with the conflicts we 'll move on to the main part of the agenda our first two items relate to petitions d1 and d2 uh both for noting a request for installation of speed limiting devices traffic and shelley street minute heads and a request for a path socket way along woodgate road from woodgate to kincuna waters estate any questions or comments on those no okay the next item relates to a specialized supplier arrangement in relation to council community satisfaction survey this item here is seeking a resolution from council to engine to a specialised pop supply arrangement with jetty research for the provision of the 2021 community satisfaction survey without first inviting written quotes pursuant to section 235b of the local government regulation 2012. councils might be aware we previously engaged gender research to do the community satisfaction survey two years ago and they own the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're seeking to you know directly point them to so we can use that that ip again without having to go back out to the market and this arrangement would be in place until the 31st of march 2024 thank you ceo ben um well the questions be exactly the same as last year yeah that 's the intention yeah yeah for the same uh series of questions so they 're repeatable and predictable we 'll get answers that can be compared any other questions thanks ben the next two items relate to finance uh financial summary as a fourth of may simon welcome financial summary first of may just in terms of recurrent revenue our fees and charges are more than the year-to-date budget um largely due to development in the region we 're expecting that the fees and charges overall for the financial year will come in above budget expectations in this regard interest revenue is above a year-to-date budget primarily due to the fact we 've got more cash than forecast again we expect that that will come in above forecast in terms of grants the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance of the financial assistance grant will continue this financial year so we 're expecting up 5.7 million to come through in june that amount is yet to be confirmed from the department and in other recurrent revenue uh the land sales this year are expected to realize about 3.8 million which was more than what we had in the half year budget review in terms of our current expenditure materials and services are tracking lower than budget with 50 percent of non-capital projects currently being delivered so far this financial year and that 's the reason for the variance there year-to-date capital expenditure totaled 64.5 million which represented 54 of the total program budget um there will be carryovers of project budgets into next year cash at reporting date was 163.2 million that is higher than forecast due to some of the variances referenced earlier we will expect cash to decrease in the next two months leading up to 30 june rates at the outstanding uh reporting date were 6.1 million i 'm just also noting that the rate arrears land sale process uh concluded in april with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered for sale by negotiation questions or comments thanks simon councillor trevor in light of the billion dollars to from the federal budget to local government uh announcing the federal budget i believe that there 'll be another round or another two or three rounds to to distribute that money is it likely that the next round would be held and delivered prior to 30th of june castro are you talking about the financial assistance grant no i 'm talking about the specific line item and the budget the billion dollar to federal governments which will be distributed i understand as same as we got that four million earlier in the year yeah i think the local capital community lcri or something good pass rates uh community facilities yeah i 'm not sure council travel have to follow that one up and come back to you thanks simon uh okay no more questions on that we 'll move on to fees and charges uh presented are the proposed 21 22 fees and charges um they 've been generally increased by 2.5 there are some exceptions to that including rounding where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees within the register will take effect of the first of july some will take effect at different dates such as licensing and registration fees any questions on the on the register council mr chairman i 'd like to give notice that at the general meeting i intend to move an amendment to the fees and charges specifically uh with regards to footpath dining we all need to if that 's happening i 'll need to declare a conflict because we have footpath dining yep that 's correct and what i intend i intend to move that it 'd be the same as a 1920 budget free for another 12 months okay and just for the purpose of the minutes noting that councilman mcphee was indicated that at the general meeting she 'll then declare interest in that component of the fees and charges councillor barnes um so i 'm 2.5 across the board increase that 's correct so most fees will have the 2.5 applied um there are some fees which have no increases some have gone up more than that but that was the broad application for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.5 an existing fee your charge and propose for your charge that was provided to councillors as part of the consultation pack out earlier this month i 'm happy to recirculate that that 's okay that hasn 't changed that no what was presented at consultation earlier this month is uh what 's in the register um the one amendment um a couple of amendments were based on feedback from council during that meeting that didn 't result in any changes to fees more just prescription to thank fees uh thanks simon any other questions or comments nope okay thank you the next item is the minutes of the audit and risk committee meeting and the charter thanks christine councillors the audit and risk committee met on the 28th of january 2021 and the minutes are attached for council 's information and the order and risk committee charter has also been reviewed and that was endorsed recently by the audit and risk committee and it 's now provided for council 's adoption thanks christine uh questions or comments all good thank you the next item 's g2 which is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in stage one for lot one and there 's lot 74 in stage two both properties uh have received offers from real local real estate agents and the offers are for market value the property at lot 74 was validly terminated by the buyer back in may 2021 it 's proposed that the exception in the local government regulation under 236-181 be applied given that the properties have previously been offered by auction or tender and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the contracts with the buyers and attend to all items to finalise the sale of those properties uh thanks christine questions or comments the next item is g3 this is in relation to a sole supply arrangement with neos human resources proprietary limited so council 's presently been using neos as a means to benchmark the stream a position descriptions and make sure that the proper levels are applied to those positions the neos is a sole supplier the only organization that provides type of service to council and it 's proposed that council apply the exception under 235 a given that 's the sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of three years thanks christine questions or comments council mcphee i just had a quick question the online job evaluation packs are they for that we purchase one of those for an actual role not each time we recruit a person is that correct the online pack so what happens is if we 've got a new position description or if there 's um changes to those descriptions with their skills or requirements then we can go through the neos which is a pack um to then benchmark with the changes in that description to make sure it 's on the appropriate level under the stream a award oh yes so it 's so it 's not every time we recruit someone we need a new job evaluation pack because if we 're recruiting someone for the same particular role we would refer back to that is that correct yeah that 's right so it 's only when it 's changed or if it 's a new position that we run it through the neos as the need arises uh thanks christine questions comments yeah all good thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our stormwater networking involves uh concrete pits which have some components called lintels and lids which historically uh for parts of our network were purchased from wholesome the componentry across our network from the various suppliers isn 't interchangeable so when we maintain these specific pits we need to buy the components from the the original manufacturer so the recommendation uh that is in front of you is that we enter into an arrangement with wholesome uh under the exceptions of the regulation uh without seeking competitive bids first for that reason thanks stuart questions or comments council mcphee um i had a question i had to google what a lintel and liv lid was is that normal practice stuart you mentioned they 're not interchangeable between different suppliers do all of the other suppliers have specific dimensions so is this a normal practice in the industry yeah now we have um development engineering standards so the standard drawings now mean that we 're standardized for any new infrastructure this only deals with historical stuff that was built we 've got i think three or four different historical standards so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another um uh particular section of our network where we manufacture the lintels uh ourselves because we can 't get a supplier to manufacture them at all and they are very expensive to manufacture for ourselves because of economies of scale but but this one in particular we can buy from the supplier so that 's that 's what we 're recommending we continue to do thank you thanks stuart uh any other questions on that one no the next one again is uh seeking uh to utilize the exemptions under section 235 over the local government regulation and this is in relation to work being done on the saltwater creek rail bridge which is now pedestrian bridge the development approval that we 've got from the department of environment and science refers to the the engineering drawings that were provided by our consultants which include a particular type of decking which is only available from from wagner 's uh not available from any other supplier so we 're recommending that council enter into an arrangement with wagners to enable us to buy that particular material so we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a it 's a one-off engagement for this particular project thanks stuart uh questions or comments oh all good thank you um michael development application good morning councillors thank you um councillors this item relates to a development application uh to subdivide land at uh 35 kirby 's road uh kalki into seven lots over two stages um the first stage uh we 'll see the creation of lots 101 and 102 fronting kebbies road with the existing dwelling house retained on lot 20 as a sort of balance lot stage 2 then sees the further subdivision of lots 101 and 102 uh into um six lots uh all about an acre in size or 4050 square metres councils you note that the this uh development um has a similar development has been to council um uh previously um back in 2017 uh and that proposal was refused the reasons for that are outlined in section 3 of the report but suffice to say at that time the planning scheme didn 't support development in this area it was in the the rural zone of the the scheme um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales and kirby 's road was in rural and as a result so what 's changed between now and then well as a result of amendments to the planning scheme this land is now included in the emerging community zone and the that emerging community zone then calls up the the local plan for that area the other thing that 's changed too is that at the time of the first application uh there was a watercourse map through the site that sort of intersected kirby 's road in the vicinity of the boundary of lot 101 and the access handle that leads to the house on lot 20. the department of agriculture and fishery have actually updated their mapping since then and that branch of the sort of waterways in that area was removed and effectively is classified as a drainage feature currently so it doesn 't trigger the assessment fusions of watercourses in the planning scheme in assessing the merit certification i won 't go into the details other than say that 's detailed in a report the application has found that the two main constraints on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slash environmental protection and flooding uh dealing with the first um i think the the pertinent uh first point i can make is that in the planning scheme this designation is not cadasta based it is dealt with as a sort of floating line between the boundary of where urban development should be and what should be protected for environmental or open space purposes and the scheme makes it clear that that the the definitive line about where the boundary between those two things should be uh should be determined um at the development assessment stage now that line uh effectively um is uh determined by the ability to protect uh the watercourse that runs um largely behind lots 101 and 102 in stage one and then sort of comes out across kirby 's roads and runs further to the the north and then eventually into the burnett river on the boundary with the adjoining property to the west and lot 20. the second part of that is the extent of flooding um and you 'll see a touch of the report is a comprehensive well there 's two sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first is a vegetation or a sort of waterways management plan that details the applicant 's proposal to rehabilitate that waterway including replanting of riparian zone type species and actually improve the environmental values of the watercourse the second is a flood management plan and effectively how the developer intends to deal with flooding on the site is to do balance uh cut and fill so the um the lots the six lots front in kevin 's road uh will be filled uh to above the dfl and that will be balanced by uh additional material being removed from the floodplain to make sure that there 's additional sorry so that the lost flood storage is regained and there 's no net impact on the amount of flood storage on this site the engineers report that was accompanying the application does indicate that there is a slight increase less than uh 30 millimeters or three centimeters on the adjoining property but that is within an area that is a dam on that property that is effectively on the water course and that increase is contained within the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on flooding or property rights effectively on the joining property so with those two things and with the increased sort of environmental outcomes that development will deliver the officers agree that it 's appropriate that those for those six lots fronting kirby 's road are suitable for rural residential type development will help provide that interface between the rural uses further to the north that the planning scheme envisages and then more intensive urban development that will occur further south in the balance of this growth area beyond that councillors the only other thing to note is that as a result of a submission that was received during public notification uh we 're alert to the use of the site um sorry chemicals uh of use of chemicals on the site as part of the previous agricultural use of the land the site is on the contaminated land register and you 'll see that their conditions have been imposed that they 'll have to obtain clearance um for that before that they are allowed to proceed with any uh works on the site so councillors subject to the conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehabilitation of the watercourse finalize the of earthworks necessary and to deal with the contamination issues is recommended that this development be approved thanks michael uh comments or questions cousin fee just question michael is this back before council because originally it was um rejected is that uh councilman this application was called the council by council of barnes oh okay thank you and one other question just to clarify the submission that was against the proposal because only because of the contaminated land uh the submission raised a number of issues um most of which i 've already touched on but in summary they were that the land was designated for open space environmental protection that the application incorrectly showed the location of the water course that the application didn 't address impacts on adjoining properties from stormwater flooding and what was the final the contaminated land issue and something about levels for access into lot 20 so i think that uh how they 're addressed is detailed in the report but by and large those issues can either be dealt with by condition or just based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other questions or comments thank you michael gavin welcome uh dealing with item 0.1 um partnership and sponsorship program so we 've had a request in writing from the ceo of royal flying doctor service rfds queensland branch seeking council 's ongoing support to the tune of fifty thousand dollars under our partnership and sponsorship program uh councils would be aware that um last year both rfds and life flight constructed a joint aero medical precinct at the airport um it was opened in march last year officially opened in march last year and they 've been operating from there since um last financial year we provided matching donations to both life flight and rfds uh to the tune of fifty thousand and councilman remember in the most recent council meeting um council signed off on a further fifty thousand dollars for life flight this year um rfds have now sought obviously um the uh comparable uh donation um and have uh requested it through our normal process and we do have the council mitchell would be happy to know it is in budget um because we had expected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them an approval last year so there was 50 000 allocated in the current financial year for this particular purpose having to take any questions if there are any the number of years of consultation that we 've had with a royal blind doctor and and like like the positioning of the these two facilities at the air at the airport and the large investment by a number of areas and levels of issues closeness and when you have a disaster in relation to evacuations mike is that by having a facility there is help facilitate a i think i understand where you 're coming from mr mayor yes yes one of the beauties of the news the patient transfer facility they call it is under the old system where rfds used to operate effectively out of hanger 161 at the airport because the hangar is on air side it would mean that any patients family members or anyone else couldn 't go with them to the point and wait until they were airlifted out with a new facility because it effectively is the building is split airside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area where they get treated by the paramedics because effectively the ambulance had to drive onto airport land previously they don 't have to do that with the new facility and so patients loved ones can stay with them until they 're actually medivacked out so that 's been an improvement i guess in both patient anxiety before they 're leaving obviously loved ones who don 't know what 's happening at that point in time and previously were left isolated um because of the issues about having to be um airside um so that 's dramatically uh improved the way they deal with those particular things it 's also made it easier for rfds and others because the facility obviously is more modern than the current one they can respond quicker because they 're able to store more equipment and provide a higher level of service than they previously quit under the in the old hangar yeah and just to add to that just in the area of the disaster management would you like to make comments in relation to that uh certainly i guess um both the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly uh when it comes to um moving patients i mean uh councils are aware that there 's a significant uh level of treatment that 's required that 's above the local capacity of the widebay hospital health service um and so people need to be back in brisbane for significant treatment so if we did have incidents or issues um that revolved resulted in significant injury then they would the capacity they 've now got at the new facility is far greater than they previously had so if we had a major incident they 'd be able to get them out quicker thanks thanks kev uh any other questions on comments on that one no okay uh next one is a lease renewal christine o2 is in relation to a lease renewal for rum city motorcycle club uh they 're presently under lease which is due to expire on the 30th of june 2021 at bingra weir road south bingra um the club 's wishing to enter into a new 10-year lease with the council it 'll be at the community rate and they 'll be responsible for 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms will be on council 's standard lease document um council officers suggest that we apply the exception contained in section 2361b2 of the local government regulation given that the renewal of the leases to the community organization and that the ceo be authorised to enter into that 10-year lease with the club thanks christine comments or questions nope all good thank you the next item is item 03 which is about a lease to the ybay hospital and health services this is the old tourist information center and um returning councillors will recall back in november 2019 council did make a resolution to enter into a five-year lease with the tenant um however the resolution didn 't reflect the terms that were negotiated for the lease the hospital came back to council and asked for uh further two years on their term to be seven years given that the site is a reserve you 're not able to have an option so because you can 't have an option under the lease they 've requested the longer term so the resolution that 's recommended for council to adopt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made at its november 2019 meeting and replace that with the ceo be authorised to enter into a lease with the y bay hospital and health services for a term um ending on the 2nd of june 2027. thanks christopher good question councillor honor yes mr chairman uh i 'd just like to ask a question in relation to the public toilets that are behind that facility that are open to uh all of the public is that included in that lease or is that councils no it 's not so the lease area that they 've got is just the building footprint it 's not the whole of that lot belongs to council to maintain and that 's correct yep ah thank you any other questions comments no thanks christine uh gav ritf um it 's gonna be dealing with the acronyms today today 's radf this one so uh report 04 so council 's aware that we regularly do rounds under the regional arts development fund uh recall for requests for submissions uh they 're then assessed by a committee in this particular round we received five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty six thousand seven hundred and forty five dollars um after assessment all of those will receive either partial or full funding um and i wasn 't going to go through each individual one but i 'm happy to take any questions if there are any no questions nope all good okay councillors our next item is r1 so bundaberg cycling club i won 't call them bcc um the uh they 've previously ran the cycle fest international event uh which council had entered into a three-year funding agreement for uh was on a sliding scale of funding with the view that um with events obviously we 're trying to seek to make them sustainable so in the first year which was 2019 uh council provided fifteen thousand dollars in funding we committed to year two ten thousand dollars in funding in year three twenty twenty one which is 5000. the event is traditionally held at the start of the year so they were able to get the u2 event in just before covert hit but unfortunately this year they had to cancel it particularly because they had attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestigious event um goes towards olympic points and others but couldn 't have it because of uh international restrictions on travel this year so they have asked instead um if that money that was um council determined would fund back in 2018 whether we would repurpose that for a new event they 're calling the bundaberg spectacular track carnival which they 're proposing to have this year so the request is to reallocate the five thousand dollars that council had previously approved for the cycle fest international event and use that instead for the bundaberg spectacular track carnival did you take any questions thanks for questions or comments no all good thank you yeah and the last three items then are in confidential we can terminate the live feed you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

AUS,QLD,Bundaberg Regional Council,Bundaberg Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/user/BundabergRC,Bundaberg Regional Council - Briefing Meeting - 21 April 2021,rqrLJrK7d7U,20210420,2831.92,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",6490,uh first i have an apology from council ronna uh whose mother passed away last friday so wayne 's uh organizing some things to do with um the funeral etc the second thing is a number of councillors have given me potential conflicts or confidence of interest for today 's meeting so it might be easier if we just go around the table if you 've got to identify which one 's up front and then when we get to that item in the agenda if you can then uh leave the room if that 's what you 've chosen or just um make sure we 've got it on the record mr man councillor trevor neil dancer martells council mcphee item t1 i know i 'm choosing to leave the room thank you cancel the barnes no vince r181 thanks mate and john l1 you 'll leave the room all right well that 's good they 're all nice and straightforward uh so the first item today is the moore park beach master plan over the year chris so this morning we 're just briefing on the mall park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in february um this is just uh uh seeking to endorse this plan into as an official master plan of councils uh so we haven 't uh adjusted oh so we made some very minor adjustments to the plan since february i 'm just looking to reorientate the community workshop area item number 13 and that was the main main adjustment we 've also submitted the final report that just provides a um a word picture and a description of the each of the areas um do we need to go back through everything which i 'm quite prepared to do or it 's no change since february obviously this was produced by inside sjc and we 're now looking to um to once this is endorsed looking to commence uh design for delivery once funding becomes available any questions excellent um financial summary as at first of april 2021 uh in terms of our current revenue much the same as last report fee income and also some of our land sales are above what we had in our forecast in terms of land sales at the reporting date we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those are reflected in the figures in the report in terms of recurrent expenditure the main variance series materials and services that 's somewhat expected in terms of a lot of the licensing expenses are incurred in the last quarter of the financial year and also some of the non-capital spend which is related to the capital project delivery which is tracking a little behind is also reflected in those figures in terms of capital spend are you to date 58.2 million um total budget 118 million um obviously as we 've alluded to previously there 's expected significant spend in the last quarter in terms of uh capital grants we have received approval for extensions of time on some of the works of queensland projects that ranges from well most of it 's from i think july through to december this year cash at the reporting date was 177 million that is higher than what we expected this time um the reason for that is the uh variance in fee income the higher income the higher land sales and the lower spend on operations and capital as referenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is lower than what we had this time last year bearing in mind that this time last year council had provided uh a freeze-on rate interest as part of the covered relief package borrowings at the end of the quarter were 71.6 million just highlighting that one of the existing loan accounts has been paid out during the last quarter any questions the operation um item g1 is the operational uh plan it 's quarter three so in accordance with the local government regulation the ceo must present to council um a report on council 's progress towards implementing the annual operational plan at least every three months the report has been provided for councillors and each manager has provided comments as to their progress towards the plan and the recommendation is that the operational plan quarter three be received and noted um thanks christine any questions councilman fee i just was wondering with the um the development applications that the percentage of low complexity development applications decided within the 10 days um what do we have like an idea of how long they are taking what the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just outside of meeting that kpi or are they yeah and that 's that 's a good question and clearly those couple of indicators are reflective of the pressure that we 're currently experiencing in that area and we 've highlighted that you know in the last few months about the you know the good news part of that is there 's a there 's quite a lot of development happening uh what i 'll do is i 'll get additional information out uh separately about those two that we haven 't haven 't met just to see how far removed we are from the current targets thank you thanks uh any other questions no okay thank you kendall waters so stage two at kinkarina waters council has entered into contracts for lot 57 59 60 65 66 67 78 and 79 in stage two stage two as councils will recall was offered for tender just before the christmas period that tender was unsuccessful and now they 've been listed for sale each of the sales are for market value and the recommendation is that council apply the exception contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously offered by tender and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the contracts with the buyers and finalize the sale of those properties all lots now councillors have been sold they are under contract um subject obviously to special conditions and completions of those sales and we 've just got that one parcel of land that council removed from sale that 's left in the estate um thanks christine i might just add that that parcel will go back on the market once we 've finalized the the entry statement and at some point probably within the next four to six weeks we 'll have consultants come and address council at a consultation day about what stage three of that estate might look like uh prior to obviously prior to lodging any formal development application to progress that so clearly the demand is there and i think it 's an opportunity for council to one to realise additional revenue but potentially also to have a major construction job involving council 's ex outside workforce into the next financial year as well questions council cooper yeah just a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many stages are available to us after that if we were to um it probably depends council cooper on some of the work that 's currently being done on the flood modelling and the drainage obviously the stage that we 're currently selling was like most developments was the easy stage to develop and there wasn 't too many issues in terms of drainage or flood flooding the other issue is it 's a very long flat uh straight area and the current development or sorry the current owners of any property have to put their own pump in there for sewage and there 's some issues there we need to work through as well so although it 's adjacent to the the woodgate surge plan uh because of topography the land there 's some technical issues that i 'm still a bit more familiar with than i am uh but that 's posing some some issues too they 're looking at so i i 'm i 'm like to put a number on it until we get some feedback from the consultants and some of the um the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just with the ratio of salesforce to ceo i would suggest that um there 's the demand is there and while the demand is there the opportunity should be taken up by how far advanced we could get to doing that pre-planning is yeah certainly the amount demands there and and and i guess it probably caught us unawares for an estate that sat there largely untouched for the better part of 15 years and then took off in you know inside six or seven months yes it has yeah obviously so so yeah that 's probably relating to the future it doesn 't really relate to the merchandise but i think when we have a clearer picture about stage three we 'll be able to address some of those broader issues that you 've raised using council trevor can we use that last block to test the market as to what the values should be going forward uh yeah we already have we 've spoken to two agents and they 've indicated that the asking price it currently is around 140 000. so um i 'm not telling any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the market that 'll be somewhere in the vicinity of that price i 'd suggest we should try north of that because that will truly tell the picture yeah it it it may having said that it 's it 's not the best block in the estate because it 's next to the main intersection into the subdivision it 's the only block in this but it is the only block yes and what we get for that will drive what what happens in the new subdivision i think we should take that opportunity to test the market properly you might look at potentially going to tender if that 's the case any other questions no thanks christine the next item councils is item g3 which is about the organizational structure so pursuant to section 196 of the local government act the council is required to adopt an organizational structure that 's appropriate to the performance of the local government and its responsibilities um the new structure that is um in councillor 's pack and it 's recommended that the organizational structure as at the 19th of april 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes to the structure is the changes that have happened in the communications department and then there 's also been changes to the community environment branch with the departure of rod ainsworth and the changes with the arts and cultural and tourism facilities department thanks christine questions council haberman thank you just a couple of questions just the um mayor 's chief of staff that just comes under the office of the mayor and ceo doesn 't need to be a separate no the mayor 's chief of staff doesn 't fall through this structure because the councillor advisor sits separate as a creature of statute so it 's not actually part of this it sits to the side so this is the local government employees so as the council advises not a local government employee as such it doesn 't fall under the ceo 's structure thank you and also with wright ainsworth 's position what 's um what 's happening there i 'll just defer together plugged in uh through this ceo um council happened the as a result of rod going um and uh suen last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just taken the opportunity to sort of i guess put those two branches together under one branch so the new branch is called arts culture tourism facilities and events it also tidies up a little bit of the tourism aspect because ben has been sitting on the bt borders council 's rep since last year and so managing that tourism partnership relationship between council and bt and so tourism development has moved across economic development tourism facilities so i still think all of aviation and ferry mid-house will sit under this new branch so the rod 's role has effectively been uh divided up between a new manager of the monk reef who will be focused entirely on the monkey rod 's old roll was looking after both the monk grief and galleries and that was obviously a bit of a stretch uh in trying to do both of those things particularly given the work that 's gone into the lawn creek and how it 's changed over the last couple of years more to um performing arts and live theater and so there 's a new branch manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch given that things like movie festival we saw there was a lot of synergies between arts and culture who effectively provided the content and the events team who effectively delivered it as an event so they 've been working collaboratively albeit are in separate branches so i just took the opportunity to put them together to get greater collaboration um between uh those particular things and i guess reflect more importantly where the current demands are so i hope that answers the question thank you thanks kev guys counselor thank you mitchell first sorry i 'm just thinking along the lines of councillor haberman where he asked where the mayor 's chief of staff fits in on the organizational structure because i did assume that he would be in office of the mayor and ceo so if he 's not a local government employee i why is that is council paying him it 's under the local government act the way that the council advisors are set up so um councils are recalled the advice that came in so the look uh the council advisor reports to the mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organizational um you know the operational branch that all falls in under the ceo is the way that it is the only thing we could do to change the organizational structure is to put a box out separate out on the side which would include the counselor advisor reporting to the mayor in the organisational structure it does report to the mayor but you won 't be able to see it from that diagram because it 's got elected counsellors mayor and counsellor so you wouldn 't have a you know tidy line to just have that box down to council advisor given that the council advisor only reports to the mayor so you don 't believe that from an aesthetics or or layout point of view that you couldn 't separate the councillors from the mayor and then have the mayor 's chief of staff located reporting to the mayor can i can i just clarify why we 're considering this this is a requirement under the local government act for the council to adopt a structure because i 'm questioning it mr ceo because the mayor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big part of the equation when it comes to mayors and councillors and being part of what takes place in the organization i think he should be noted on there somewhere well how about given the fact that it 's a new position that the requirements for that position are spelled out in the local government act that we 'll seek advice from the department of local government on the basis of that proposed structure and see what their advice is as to how it should be reflected so that hasn 't already been done not by me okay but i 'm happy to take advice from the department and if they give us advice as to how to reflect that on that structure no i just thought that you know all employees are reflected here somewhere and i think the problem is is that this is as i 've said several times in this room this is a newly created position the act it is unlike any other position in the organization there 's no other position other than the ceo that the act spells out how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what the requirements are so on the basis there 's no no reportability to anyone other than me i 'm not going to go back over what we 've already discussed previously several times we 've we 've received legal advice from this we 've received advice from the department we 're not here to have that discussion today but i 'm happy to take your question as to how that position should appear on the chart and take advice from the department that 's right mr ceo i can see that you 're quite adamant in not having the mayor 's chief of staff on the organisational structure i didn 't say that at all i said i 'd take advice from the department given the fact there seems to be some question because it 's a newly created position if you feel the need to take advice well clearly i do all right thank you thank you my recollection is that this council will um sorry about it um yeah so councilman mitchell is referring to chief of staff while christine is talking about a council advisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the i don 't believe that this council ever approved the position of uh chief of staff it actually it approved the position of a council advisor and i think that 's where the is coming from so i think we need some clarity on that because that would um alleviate a lot of concerns i think that council mitchell 's raising well i dispute that in its entirety there 's no confusion because of the the title of the position we 've already had that discussion in here as well and we 've amended any of our policies to reflect them where we 've had council advisor chief of staff which is the same position just to remove any any doubt councillors can i just add as well this section 9196 it 's about the appointment of other local government employees and it sits under division two which is about other local government employees so the section in the act i 'm sure if we go to the department will come back to us and we 'll clarify that the organizational structure that we 're here to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite specific that a council advisor the mayor 's chief of staff is not classed as a local government employee for the purposes of the act which is why i guess it doesn 't need to be shown in this part here thanks chris any other questions okay move on to corporate plan uh item g1 corporate plan so as councils will recall we 've been involved with planning workshops which were facilitated through helen skippen that planning workshop outlined you know some changes to the corporate plan and the major changes that we 've got uh revised game changes and descriptions core roles and advocacy priorities included update to our regional asset information removal of capital projects operating themes updated and description added to the vision of what council considers to be our best in our community the plan has been circulated to council 's employees and also to the wider community where submissions were encouraged that was on the 30th of march council did receive one public submission and a number of submissions from council staff they have all been incorporated into the plan and the final version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation is that the council adopt the corporate plan 2021-2026 um councillors as as the report states we 've got a lift at the chillers palace backpackers memorial that is currently maintained by schindler lifts we have a contract with schindler lifts we want to renegotiate the pricing of that contract so we 're seeking to utilize the exemption under section 235 via the local government regulation that would enable us to deal exclusively with them rather than seeking competitive tenders oh i think we 're skipping ahead john morning castles um the uh i 'm dealing with item oh one which is partnership and sponsorship grain application for life flight foundation so life flight to council aware operate um the helicopter rescue service um out of the airport now it 's part of the medical precinct we have provided for the last couple of years fifty thousand dollar uh financial assistance through their partnership and sponsorships um grant process uh to offset some of the costs of their operational costs as counselors are probably aware they 've had given presentations previously they are not fully funded and require sponsorships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of their operations uh so this proposal is purely and simply just to once again uh this financial year provide fifty thousand dollars in accordance with what we 've done uh historically uh the fifty thousand is already budgeted for so happy to take any questions if there are any uh for part of the bagara admin center there was a space that was present previously unleashed in the ag tech hub that space is proposed to be leased to the bernard mary regional group the mary regional group are a community organization and registered not-for-profit organization they do currently lease a portion of the property in the ag tech hub already so this will expand their area that they 'll have under lease they 're proposing that the commencement date will be no earlier than the 28th of april and the alignment of the lease will be so that it aligns with the expiry date of their current area and that there 'll be a further um option of five years um for extending that lease the proposed rent is presently 50 less than market value which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group given that they 're a community group and the economic benefits that the ag tech precinct will have for the region the rent will increase annually by two percent or cpi whichever is the higher and the remainder of the conditions will be on council standard lease document and the recommendation is that council apply the exception in section 2361b2 given that it 's a community organization and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the lease and finalize those lease negotiations next one is item 03 another lease this is for the burnet heads progress and sports association they presently have a lease at jack norgate oval which is state-owned reserve land for recreation that 's at 19 zunker street um that lease is due to expire on the 30th of june 2021 and the association have been working with council about renewing their lease for a further 10-year term rent will be proposed at the community group rate and the remainder of the terms will be on council standard lease terms it 's recommended that council apply the exception in section 236 given that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter into the lease with the progress association the next item 's o4 which is a lease of um part of the airport to bitten holdings proprietary limited it 's lease be the tenant is a current tenant for one of the general aviation hangars their lease is due to expire and it 's proposed that a further lease be entered into for a term of five years with a further five year option the rent is for market value and will be subject to annual increases of three percent um the lessee will be responsible for their outgoings and the remainder of the terms of the lease will be on council standard lease document it 's recommended that section 23613 sorry 1c3 of the local government regulation be applied given that it 's a renewal of a lease to an existing tenant and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the lease with bitten holdings for that site be located at the airport thank you questions on that one no all good the next item is item 05 which is a lease to the state of queensland 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jack norgate oval is a reserve for local government with a sub-purpose of state emergency center council is the trustee of that land um the state of queensland through the public safety business agency wished to lease that property for the benefit of the burnet heads rural fire brigade and wish to enter into a 10-year lease and those lease terms will be on council standard lease document and it 's recommended that council apply the exception in 2361b1 given that it 's a disposal of a lease interest to a government agency and that the ceo be authorised to enter into the 10-year lease thanks christine questions on that one no all good thank you um we found some planners excellent we 'll go back to l1 council earmonth it 's going to clear thanks sarah briefing started at 10. so um this morning i 'm presenting item l1 which deals with the development application for a reconfiguration of a lot one light into two lots located at 106 fe walker street councillors as you might be aware this site has existing development approvals for a shopping complex in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overriding the planning scheme under the sustainable planning act from 2013 and a material change used for a stage shopping centre which was approved in 2016. the subject lot reconfiguration application is to enable the approved shopping center to be undertaken in a staged manner and is subject to code assessment under the bundaberg council regional planning scheme uh the proposed reconfiguration aims to subdivide the subject site into two new lots comprising an area of 2.34 hectares and 6.2 hectares respectively as a consequence of the pro proposed reconfiguration the applicant has also made a concurrent minor change request to which is being assessed in parallel with this request and is aimed to align the uh approved district center with any development permit for a reconfiguration of a lot offices have assessed the minor change request and it 's anticipated that this minor change request will be determined under delegation in parallel with this uh reconfiguration of a lot application this will ensure that the staging and the development site under both approvals are appropriate and not in conflict with each other the key consideration by offices in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the provision of infrastructure such as road construction and storm water infrastructure will be implemented as part of this reconfiguration of a lot approval council is upon review of the report before you today an error in one of the conditions regarding road construction um was found in in that the the current condition reads that um the road will be designed in accordance with the um approved plans uh but it 's actually anticipated this road will be designed and constructed and the applicant 's aware um that uh council would like them to reconstruct the road as part of this reconfiguration of a lot so after this meeting i will update condition 18 so that it 's clear that they do have to construct it the second key consideration by officers was reciprocal access easements however this was determined to be better placed in the conditions on the existing shopping centre and you 'd also see in the application before you that it was subject to code assessment therefore public notification was not required however council did receive one not properly made submission this not properly made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll see that after assessing the application against all of the planning scheme officers conclude that the application complies and can be conditioned to comply with the planning scheme and approval is recommended thanks sarah question comments council bonds along with the water management are there any plans that show the upstream attachment area under downstream is there any indication of where the actual catchment oh sorry council bounce mike the microphone sorry about that yeah so are there any um are there any plans to show the upstream catchment area and the downstream dispersal area or where it might be running through um the what do you call the wetlands at all because i know that shows the the area there but i 'm just wondering if there 's any extended um i might just defer to our senior planner grant barringer who um assessed the application um through the chair um look there was extensive studies done council of arts over that site it was undertaken by ghd consulting we don 't actually have one for you today but we can we can foreshadow that it it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um yeah we could get that for them get a copy of that one yeah that 's fine thank you was there any particular questions around it no no just um i mean obviously it 's a fairly controversial proposal but i 'd just like to get some some visual facts if you like so that i can see where the actual catchment is and what the the possible downstream effects could be rather than just the slight specific thank you so if we get that out to all councillors prior to the council considering this at the meeting thanks graeme uh sarah back to you any other questions no all right we 'll distribute that additional information during the week and you 'll make an amendment to conditions thanks all right um we 'll get councillor lee moths back and for the landfill gap if you 're going to do that one okay hello again councillors um item p1 this is just a preferred supplier arrangement that we should enter into so atw atc williams sorry the local application applied there atc williams proprietary limited ra surveying and modeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities so just to give a bit of background in order for us to get an environmental licence to run a landfill what we have to do is we have to provide survey and a final finished model so what we expect will be the completed height of our waste facility once we 've put all the possible waste we can in we then submit that as part of our environmental license application it 's assessed by the state government department of environment um and then they approve then a what they call a field model which is a maximum height we 're allowed to fill to um at guanaba particularly we 've been doing various things to try to look at how we can maximize the use of that facility and also how we can minimize the cost of finally capping it so at the moment the approved capping process is effectively put a meter of soil over the the final amount of waste we put in we then put a clay cap on top of that so that 's about a foot thick and then soil on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it what we 've been doing over the last couple of years is running what we call a fighter cap troll so the intention with the fido cap is you that you plant trees that effectively act by transpiring on the water so if any rain because rain is the greatest danger to a landfill you don 't want water percolating into a landfill which is why the current approved process in the queensland government is a clay cap to effectively put a shell over the top of the waste the phytocap what it does is uses trees to transpire any any rain that falls in so effectively rain falls only gets over much through the soil profile then picked up by the roots of the trees and transpired out so effectively stops the water penetrating through so we 've been trialling that we 've been trying to get approval from the state government to accept that as an acceptable capping process it 's about 30 percent of the cost of a normal clay cap so obviously a significant saving but what it also means is that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle because we don 't want to grow trees on hills effectively so flatten them out a little bit and change the profile in order to do that we 've got to go on a mendel environmental licence which is why we want to engage atc williams to do that work happy to take any questions thanks questions yeah straightforward thank you uh next one mitchell for t1 as well i 'll tell you one as well okay but r1 right thank you councils on mar one which is an extension of term for rent relief cost curve proprietary limit so cost curve is the company name of the travel agent across the road so operates the and it currently releases the property next to our civic arcade we 've had a discussion about this previously in consultation um meetings just indicate that um the previous proprietor um passed away last year um he 's handed it over to his um his wife who has been running it obviously during covert they 've been significantly impacted and yet to make a decision going forward about what they 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're seeking effectively a rent relief for the period of one october the 31st of march bear in mind we 're all in april um and uh because we originally had provided uh a rent relief period during our um covered um incentives which went up to 30 september they obviously haven 't been able to operate for a large period of this and obviously everyone 's aware of the impacts on the travel industry so they 're seeking this extension to the end of last month so i 'm happy to take any questions if there are any uh the value of it is in the report about fifteen thousand three hundred dollars um if we were to agree thanks for questions all good uh we 'll get council feedback council mitchell back i should say okay councillors next item is s1 rent relief for airport cafe um so this council is aware once again similar sort of situation this is a business this business operates the carry-on cafe out of the airport um they had received an initial rent free period as part of the initial covert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of september then then request an extension after that given the impact on the airline industry which obviously has a flow on effect to their business they were required they were provided an extra extension till the 31st of december uh and then a further 50 discount was agreed at the start of this year taking them up until the end of march they 've they 've once again written into council at the end of uh job keeper program which finished the end of march they 've indicated that they are unable financially to sustain the business at this point in time so they haven 't opened since the end of march and um and are proposing to do a bit of a restructure of their business and provide a further proposal back to council so they 've asked that for the period they 're going to be closed which is the month of april uh can they get their rent way for that period um that monthly rental is a figure of 1921.88 i 'm happy to take any questions if there are any ah thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my point of view this is a fairly unique situation so while our business says walmart and the shopping center would be adversely affected by kobe this business is 100 reliant on network uh passengers so i think when we when we have a look at this we need to recognize just how unique this business is and what the actual customer catchers the um as you said is the only operator out there the only facility we have as i mentioned it councils recently allowed effectively a small coffee cart to operate um within the terminal space just to provide the basic element of a cup of coffee um but certainly if they if their business case if they came back to us and said listen it doesn 't stack up we would then have to consider whether we go back out to market bearing in mind that when we 've done this previously they were the only applicants and i guess with the uncertainty one would always hope that things are only improved and that the airlines are getting back to capacity but we 've still only got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are improving but you know every little jolt we have with those shutdowns dramatically impacts passengers and they immediately almost canceled flights after the last one so as a result of people being unwilling to fly so we would then have to look at potentially staffing ourselves which wouldn 't from my perspective be the ideal situation thanks uh any other questions on that one all right no other late items more confidential okay so we 've got one item in confidential and councillor mcphee has declared a conflict you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

mr mayor the council allows the mayor to appoint a councillor councillor just uh oh sorry you 're moving uh motion recommendations thank you councillor yes sorry the council allows the mayor to appoint a council advisor in accordance with section 197a of the local government act 2009 and the local government regulation 2012 in brackets part 2a thank you uh councillor can i have a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak further in relation to the matter yes thank you mr mayor the final local government uh reforms commenced in uh on october 2012 2012 uh on the 12th of october 2020 the changes included the establishment of the role of council advisor council advisors are appointed to assist councillors to undertake their role under the local government act 2009 in brackets lga the lga outlined the rules about council 's advisers in it uh covered about in part five and part two a in brackets section 197a and 197d thank you councillor cooper does any other council wish to raise any queries or speak against the motion yeah uh he 's councillor barnes thank you mr morning councillors good morning councilman mr mayor i 'll have to speak against the motion i 'm having given this considerable amount of thought mr mayor at this particular point in time as we 're coming through the pandemic i don 't believe it 's the right time to go creating new positions and particularly when i guess um i guess you could say that potentially we have 900 members of staff that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team i 'm just wondering what sort of example we 're putting out there in the community so i 'd have to ask councillors to um show some restraint and to vote against the motion thank you uh council bands any other queries or questions just before moving on there is i think council barnes i think in relation to just alleviating some of your concerns there through me as the chair is obviously he actually creates a greater dealer of openness and transparency and in these days of what 's occurred at local government over a number of years anything we can do he 's uh he 's he 's only a benefit for the uh for the community and the regulatory authorities councilor cooper i have a question more to the ceo mr mayor um the report says that there are no financial implications can you explain that please uh through you mr mayor um thanks we 're about to have a restructure in the executive services unit uh we 've got two current vacancies one as a result of a resignation the financial services team have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those positions being filled externally the appointment of the advisor can actually be done on a cost neutral basis in fact we might end up with a small saving so that 's why that comment is in the report that there are no financial implications thanks uh council trevor thank you very much mr mayor look i 'd like to speak in support of the motion when the changes happened in the local government act on 12th of october there was a range of changes right across the board looking at how we operate as councils how the organization operates and and these changes were made to improve local government now a lot of people might not understand in the in the broader community just how big a job the mayor has on their plate not only from the ceremonial point of view where they attend functions and represent the communion council as a whole but in the day-to-day workload in the mayor 's office in seeing people organizations looking to develop policy it 's a big job now the state government wouldn 't have made that change without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a need now some accounts the councils have been categorized and some of the bigger councillors councils have been offered up to four or five advisers to assist their mayors why would we tie our mayor 's one hand behind their back and say we don 't want to get the best job done for our community we don 't want to have the best policies we don 't want to have the best representation it 's available i believe we should make that resource available to the mayor so his time is better served for our community as a whole a council barn spoke about now is not the right time i think his very words make sure this is the right time when there 's a pandemic in place the workload in the mayor 's office goes up not down so what we need to do as a council is support our mayor so that we can get the best job done in these difficult times for our community as a whole thank you thank you uh councillors uh councillor um cooper any rights or i 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may yep i too would like to speak but in support of the appointment as well i wasn 't going to but as others have spoken i would like to say to the community that in this case i have done my due diligence diligence and research the need for this appointment and i 've been back through the the um the bill that got put to parliament the public hearing to the economics and governance committee the transcripts the speakers who attended those public hearings being the likes of alan mcstyren the chairman of the crime and corruption commission greg hallam the ceo of the local government association of queensland notable people they 're they 've considered and the government has considered that there is a need for this position and it 's already happening this legitimizes it it puts into full transparency a code of conduct for this appointee is there a a role description before the motion that 's correct i 'll give every council the opportunity to speak in relation to the motion you 're talking about the alternative isn 't it we 've clara we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ceo that has been a tradition but under the standing orders there 's no requirement to do it in order that 's correct yeah so over to you sorry for that natural and i just want um the community to know that i have researched this i haven 't just taken it on board from advice from from only one source and that we have assurances that this is going to be a cost neutral position to council and that it 's only for the one term that we 're not committing as a council this term to future terms of council to have the appoint appointment carry over for years and years and years and years so if we find that this isn 't working for us or future councils they can not make a future appointment thank you very much thanks councilman mitchell i 'll just uh any other councils wish to speak in relation to the matter um just a question right there councillor otter yep uh mr mayor in regard [Music] uh on behalf of council and i note that in the past you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants and i am at the beginning of the council particularly in regard to the sewage system at the louisiana we got a large help there is this going to enable you to represent us better at a higher level from council and negotiate more outcomes in relation to funding strength returning to council yeah thanks uh councillor ireland i 'll just uh get the ceo to clarify a little bit about the actual uh particular opening actually yes it will counsel honor yeah because any way that it can uh can free uh not it 's not just a matter of freeing up if the if when you read the act it 's about the technicality changes in relation to the new legislation that is put forward and uh the oversight and transparency uh role uh certainly um i 'll always maintain as as a 110 in relation to chasing funding grant as does the the whole uh team here at council yeah uh any other questions at all from the floor the clarification yeah we 've heard the term you mentioned the questions through you mr ceo uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the restructuring uh through different eyes if this position is not created because the two are clearly interlinked yeah thanks councillor cooper mr

actual uh webrock uh incorporated is any other councils wish to speak in relation council barnes yep my understanding during my term on councils has been that the state and the feds are have encouraged local governments to work on a more regional basis rather than with individual councils indeed we have an important role to play in advocating for the white bay burnett region on issues such as transport communications health and water security the region 's voice should be heard more without me in brisbane and canberra our member council should work together to make sure that we get our fair share of investing from other levels of government particularly as we 've been identified as one of the most disadvantaged regions in australia and we need to address that mr mayor the last part of of my address was words that you used in the media release they were yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how valuable the membership of webrock is i therefore can 't support the motion i ask councillors

exist for it to operate under and where it will be located in bundaberg however subsequently council developed a business case and concept design which identified if a centre if there was a centre what it would cost to build and operate so in consultation with the regional department of education staff council officers have drafted an mou between the department of education and council to

the background of this is that metroid count is an australian company based in western australia council utilizes metro account traffic counters and classifiers to collate all traffic survey data

data validation and report generation three timely export of data from every survey site into gs formats four easy download of spreadsheet and pdf data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily shares and receives traffic data from neighbouring councils and government organisations atlas is powered by and complements metro accounts mte software which council already possesses for our traffic count program however currently all data collected has to be entered manually into a spreadsheet after reports are generated via the mte software the numerous mt data reports required are currently exported manually and individually atlas will provide a large saving in time for the file management and administration of our traffic count data it will also provide our gis department with a more efficient way of sourcing and accessing data to utilise in our gis system as well as providing automated custom reports required for grants commission reporting it will also allow data to be safe from unauthorized or mistaken editing as entity and export processes are automated councils road corridor management system team have been trialling atlas free of charge for five months with very successful results thank you councillor trevor any other councillors wish to raise any queries or speak against the matter nope all those in favor goes against so moved the next items are from the @ @

short-term accommodation and multiple dwellings as well as a variation request to vary the effect of the planning scheme for development under the preliminary approval the application includes a

permits lodged over the site the bernat harbour marine village development is proposed to be delayed under the umbrella of two separate town planning approvals stage one of the bernard heads marina village has previously been approved by council at its last meeting on the 24th of november and the proposal for stage two can be summarised as follows the prelu the preliminary approval includes a series of residential buildings which are distributed along the waterfront to the east of the village a 10 level resort complex with associated 2205 square metres a three level conference facility recreation restaurant and retail facilities the resort complex is located centrally on the small peninsula on a north-south access running from the harbour esplanade to the marina the public promenade continues along the harbour edge in front of all buildings providing access to the wider community and vehicular access to the site is provided through a formal landscaped entry boulevard which distributes vehicles to residential and resort buildings from a central roundabout a total of 43 properly made submissions and three not properly made submissions were received over both periods combined of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nine submissions were in support of the development and councillors will be aware that there 's been several emails received in the last few days both for and

wishing raise any queries or speak against the most council mclaughlin no no do you want to speak in relation to the motion i 'm just giving council mclaughlin and if any other counselors wish to speak as well please you know something can i just clarify all i 've done is outline the proposal that 's right speak for or against emotions because i don 't have a vote thanks i know that 's mr ceo and i 'm i 'm sure the council after many decades in council understands that also any type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mr mayor i wanted to make some comments about the material change of use of stage two of the heads marina development not only as a divisional counsellor for the area but also due to my knowledge of the site from being an active member of the local burning heads community groups for the last 15 years firstly i wish to state clearly that the parcel of land that this development is on has been extensively discussed as a future site to become a resort and is consistent with what has been identified in council 's previous planning documents and what has been openly discussed with the community for many years for example the bundaberg regional council planning scheme 2015 states that the development of the burna heads boat harbour and adjacent foreshore would provide an integrated resort development that caters for tourism and could include function and entertainment facilities hotel retail residential and marina related businesses another example is the burnet heads local area plan 2017 which makes a recommendation to change the site zoning to identify the marina site as a key development for the burnet heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan at local area plan 2017 included public consultation sessions at burnet heads which were well attended and council officers were open about possible future site on top of these sessions there were further consultation sessions to do with the burnett heads town centre project where this site was raised and discussed by community members it 's also been discussed for many years at various burnet heads progress and sports association and the burnt heads business network meetings council offices were always open with the community that the infrastructure upgrades to the nearby burnet heads town centre and stage one of this project could naturally lead to the future development of this site they were open about it being a strategic location that could be looked at in the future well there is always a diversity of opinions generally speaking most residents have accepted the development at this site and would at this site and would occur at some point what they want is a development that aligns with the community 's character while providing for its future developing a site into a resort complex that naturally flows on from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre fits with the character of the area the resort can be a real draw card to the marina and boost the nearby businesses in the town centre the connectivity to the town centre via footpath that goes through the site to the water 's edge enables the site to link into and complement the town centre it is also pleasing to see that the continuation of the public foreshare footpath from stage one of the project into stage two and inclusion of public beach this retains community use for part of the harbours for sure i also welcome the inclusion of a range of measures to minimise the lighting impact on our local turtle population and other marine life this is an example of an environmentally appropriate development and aligns with local community expectations the only aspect that really concerns me is the 10 story building as this is something that hasn 't really taken to the community and needs further consultation the aspect of the application that up to six stories fits with the neighboring building heights in stage one of the marina and also the burnet heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expecting to occur along the boat harbour precinct the 10 story building doesn 't have the same history of public consultation and the community hasn 't had the opportunity to properly voice its opinion is als it also does not fit with the zoning of neighbouring areas now some of this is the fault of covert 19 pandemic which saw the consultation period occur when there were restrictions on public gatherings which meant the public wouldn 't occur couldn 't occur to discuss the proposal and the developer had no opportunity to meet with local community for the reasons i 've outlined i support preliminary approval of up to six stories as it 's entirely consistent with a strategic plan for the site is generally supported by the community as shown through previous consultation and is consistent with neighbouring area including stage one of this project and the burnt headstown centre i also support ensuring that the 10 story aspect remains impact accessible as that will enable the community to have its say and for council to consider the community 's feedback when assessing the aspect of this plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the matter yeah thanks councillor barnes um thanks councillor mclaughlin good morning councillors um councilman i agree with basically everything you 've said um i guess that there 's nobody in this room that would actually go against the proposal of the marina at burner heads as stage one i think i think it 's a given i think that the community want it and that we should support it i 'm however concerned about some of the aspects of that relate to condition 12 in relation to building heights the report indicates that a zone that is close aligned to the envisioned high density mixed use of the land is a high density residential zone within the zone the maximum height anticipated in similar coastal areas is five story then goes on to talk about the esplanade dual matter the laser performance outcome in this zone states that development has a medium rise build form that is compatible with the existing and intended scale and character of the surrounding area six stories is fine don 't have an issue with it further it says building heights nominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are illustrative of the preferred layout and development orientation i 've had to look through that and i can 't find any ground level elevation concept drawings that indicate 10 story buildings within it it all relates to only the the heights of stage one and i can understand why just further refer to the report further after the minister called into the bagara matter the state directed temporary local plant insurance one 2009 uh begawa building height and sea turtle sensitive area also came into effect since the adoption of the burner heads local plan the applicant was requested within a council 's information request to provide further grounds for the proposed height over and above the envisioned for that envisioned for other coastal areas specifically officers requested one further plan information to better demonstrate the overall height and visit in the preliminary approval master plan to assist in establishing sufficient planning grounds to support any non-compliance within the planning scheme additional to additional view perspectives taken from other prominent locations would be beneficial to clarify the impact of the development on the surrounding locality these perspectives possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council and the community to visualize what development will look like when viewed from other prominent locations it is requested that additional indicative elevations and prospective views be provided the applicant did not prepare and submit the requested information rather they provide a justification for the proposed 10 stories from a total management perspective within their response the applicant states the additional justification sought by council is found in map six alternative building heights and setbacks for the burner hedge town center local plan i can 't find anything and i don 't if anyone else can that shows an actual elevation of what 10 stories would look like it also refers repeatedly to the beachside character of the local area and i think that councils will understand that the sleepy village type atmosphere of burner heads is something that 's special to them and yet they do want something of the magnitude of what 's being proposed in stage one given officers do not have detailed design plans i 'm quoting again from the report demonstrating the above it is recommended that height plans above six stories be subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment benchmark include including the strategic framework furthermore it 'll enable the community to have their input on their views on detailed design and circumstances any application over this height is publicly advertised in this regard officers recommend that a variation to the planning scheme differing to what the applicant requested be conditioned the submitted height master plan will also be approved as amended by council with a condition confirming a maximum height of six stories great i fully support that and i understand that 's reflected in condition 12. it doesn 't however take away from the fact that we 're also looking at a a preliminary approval the planning scheme requires applicants to consider this feature and the more recent planning scheme amendments has introduced the sea turtle sensitive area overlay code given this code came into effect prior to the subject application entering the decision stage full weight can be given to this code prior to this overlay coming into effect the subject site was still mapped as being within the sea turtle sensitive area with requirements under the nuisance code it then go goes on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also refers that the conditions imposed on proposals will comply with all acceptable outcomes of the code other than other than oa acceptable outcome 5 which relates to the screen of the development located on land visible to the beach direct light onto the beach is the number one risk to the turtle population we 've got sky what do you call it a glow but direct light onto it is the most intense and other than ao5 so it doesn 't comply with that it would not be possible for landscaping to screen the development to oaks beach in monroepole beach to the south given that some of the buildings are 10 stories in height when the subject application was lodged sea turtle requirements were located within the nuisance code the relevant performance outcome under this planning scheme p preferred outcome eight requires that if requires that partly limit impacts from artificial lighting on sea turtle nesting areas it is considered that when giving weight to both assessment benchmarks and the recommendations and findings of the turtle management plan that the intent of both codes has not has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both codes mr mayor it 's my belief that the vast majority of burna head residents and indeed residents from across the region will welcome this development as it is proposed in accordance with the council 's planning scheme which in itself was adopted following extensive community consultation i also believe that this development may well become a catalyst for changes within the local township but those changes and the way we vote today should not be at the detriment to the ancient mariners that visit our shores every year those who sit around this table today play an essential role in perfect protecting the various species of sea turtles which choose our shores to lay their eggs to ensure their survival the changes that we should focus on should protect the village atmosphere of the township as it exists whilst welcoming the investment of a modern world-class marina complex at the mouth of the safest port on queensland 's coast over upcoming years the area is likely to see some change in its population and with it the possibility of a shift in its residents outlook and opinions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to progress as such it should not be our role to make decisions which either directly or indirectly binds future residents or elected members to bow to the decisions of their predecessors that 's not our role in my opinion a perimeter approval should only be issued for potential developments which are proposed within the lifespan of an existing planning scheme not second-guessing what might happen in the future they should not be handed out as an indefinite indefinite tool which could unreasonably direct unreasonably direct planning policy into the future and place unreasonable pressure on our successes indeed to engage in such a tactic consider precedence for future non-compliance applications submitted to council and sum it up to provide or even refer to any preemptive preliminary approval without knowing what may be contained in the future planning scheme is in my opinion unwarranted let 's support the application before us as it relates to stage one and which was count and which the current community is eager to embrace and let future stages be assessed by those who are elected to do so counselors i 'd like to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils i move um amendments please do the amendment council are you uh happy to uh to table the notes that you have here today sure that 's all right he 's wendy or someone in night space wendy i might need to refer to them um counselors hold on i 'll finish that first yeah do you need to refer to them well i don 't know but it depends on what 's if i have to close that 's all good so councilman please go ahead with the amendment yeah thank you mr mayor yes as i move amendment to condition 12 of the report um and that it be dealt with in two parts a and b 12a the maximum height of any building or structure associated with stage one must not exceed six stories above natural ground level as shown on the amended approval plan 4.9 building height diagram dated 1 12 20. b the maximum height for any sub subsequent stage will be assessed by the council on the day against a planning scheme as may be adopted from time to time by the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such this approval does not constitute a preliminary approval for any subsequent stage of the development and just speaking to that i think that yeah hold on just what we have to do because it 's an actual amendment i just want to this is just to clarify if it 's substantially moved out of the context of the original amendment so i 'll just it 's a clarification thank you mr mayor i i think looking at uh section 8.4.1 the standing orders for council meeting policy and i 'll read it out an amendment to emotion will be in terms which maintain or further clarifies the intent of the original motion and does not contradict the motion my summation of the way in which you 've just worded that amendment is that it 's contrary to that and can 't be accepted as an amendment thank you mr ceo as it has been identified as a substantial change from the original motion the motion is not accepted counselor barnes it 's the bear with with respect i 'd ask you to reconsider the motion council is there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it 's not accepted because it 's substantially outside of the actual motion council bars with respect mr mayor i don 't agree oh that 's everyone is entitled to that councilor barnes it really is thank you so uh anything else would suggest that if councillor barnes wants to pursue that motion he should pursue it as an alternate motion because clearly it 's not an amendment that the original motion would then need to be put and then council of barnes if that motion if sorry the original motion was lost council demands could move that as an alternate notion i 'm also concerned about the wording of the second part of that motion i 'm not sure that it 's actually lawful to uh the word the way which was worded that i need to look at that in more detail well can i ask what part of the bit of where you 're trying to bind a council to a future planning scheme which is completely unknown so i think if i draw on the words out of the policy again uh the motion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that has been identified substantial change and you 're a very long-standing counselor i know you know the procedures and policy the amendment is obviously ruled out of order uh the ceo has identified that there is a possibility of an alternative motion after the original motion uh if the original motion fails in its part okay councillor barnes you understand that i do mr mayor i 'll move a motion of dissent against the cheers um assessment yeah it 's a procedural motion procedural nation i 'll just get some advice on that one first before we go mr mel just explain that you know exactly what you 're doing and you understand it and i know what i 'm doing you 've prepared well today and i must compliment you on that and uh but we 'll just go through with what normal procedures are and that you 're certainly uh entitled to uh you know you 've done the amendment i 've outlined the alternative your is a what is your that you 're moving now exactly at the center motion of the descent so under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to a ruling of the chair on a point of order where such motion is moved further consideration of any matter will be suspended until after a ruling is made that 's right i just need to check for christmas whether the motion of descent needs to go to a vote or whether the mayor can rule on it as a chair has to go straight to the vote steve thank you councilman welcome to the council secretary i know you know it well councillor barnes it 's not a substantial diversion okay so the motion to set necessarily thank you councillor barnes don 't need a second okay so uh councillor barnes has uh put forward a motion of descent in the chair so uh those four okay sorry can i just clarify the motion to descend is a motion to set against your ruling yeah that the amendment as proposed was not an amendment are you happy to clarify that mister uh yes the motion dissent is against your ruling that it 's it 's not a um an amendment due to the fact that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying is i don 't believe it is a substantial deviation from the motion yeah we 're not here so it 's just the exact wording that was because that 's different to the original but yeah is that the but you 're moving yeah so those in favor those against sorry i 'm not voting because i don 't entirely understand what 's going on um and i don 't want to participate in a vote for something that i don 't really understand what 's happening sorry i 'll just probably a bit of advice on that um okay we 're not voting in votes yeah council of barnes has proposed an amendment to the emotion that is has already been moved and seconded yeah under council standing orders for council meeting policy the mayor has ruled as the chairperson of the meeting which is entitled to that it is not an amendment when you look at the wording of the standing meeting orders policy it deviates entirely from the original motion council of barnes has then moved a motion of dissent a procedural motion against the mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council abundance management has said percent emotional descent then needs to be voted on by the councillors so what you 're voting on now is just the motion of dissent moved by council of barnes against the mayor 's ruling that the amendment can 't be considered that clear yeah i understand all of that what what i don 't understand is i 'm not very clear on whether my view is on whether it is actually far removed from the original motion because that went through that very quickly and i can can we so council mcphee is the advice that i 've in making my determination i 've sought advice from the ceo the ceo has then sought advice from from the legal side of of of council as well so that 's when making that decision as well is uh it 's you know it 's for clarity mr if i can read out the standing orders for council meetings policy thanks a moment will be in terms which maintain maintain or further clarify the intent of the original motion and do not contradict the motion thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time and patience with that yeah i know we just it 's official council meeting so uh the expectations is is certainly that uh people you know have that information i know the learned council is certainly he 's over with that as well so i 'll now put to those in favor of council barnes 's motion motion of descent as councillor barnes those against yep the matter is uh he 's affirmed in the uh in the the negative thank you mr miller so let 's before going forward i just want to check what graham you 're saying anything else there on that that 's been dealt with yet so council of barnes yep yes accordingly um i advise that should the um recommendation before council be accepted i 'm sorry should the matter before council be lost i 'll be moving an alternative recommendation and that recommendation will include my amendments to paragraph 12 a and b yep as mentioned before thanks councillor barnes that 's good so we go back to the original nation uh the original recommendation um was and i had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken relation to the matter and the details i thank the councils for the contributions uh there in relation to to the item before us that today and now the matter will go to the actual sorry yeah any other speakers yeah that 's a in relation to this particular motion oh councillor john lermont yeah 12 years for currency in the additional 15 years that 's why yeah do you want to address the technicality is there a question that 's all out of that john that yep we 'll do any other councillors mr we can relate to the matter no so we 'll just go straight to the vote uh all those in favor those against his uh councillor honor councillor barnes and uh and councillor mitchell thank you the matter is uh affirmed in the positive the council of barns you understand that as the matter 's been affirmed in the positive the alternative lapses i 'll just say i know that the newer councils understand that as well because that is a a matter of procedures that after a while numb councils know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor i 'm aware of that that 's i appreciate your name just to assist the new councillors so uh now we go to the community and

come to mind um i move sorry uh pursuant to section 150 e l for local government 2009 i wish to inform a meeting that i may have a prescribed conflict of interest in the matter the name of the internet that has an interest in the matter is qantas the nature of my relationship with that is today is that approximately 10 years ago qantas celebrated a milestone in its relationship with bunker and as such gave all councillors a return a complimentary return airfare to brisbane and that was then declared in my conflict my register of interest as a hospitality benefit i believe that the um i believe that it 's that far removed and was applicable to all councillors at the time that um it entitles me to remain in the meeting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he 's pursued the section 150 eq of the act council has been informed of declarable conflict of interest and and councillor barnes has stated that he believes he can participate and vote on the matter the other councillors must decide whether council barnes may participate in a decision about the matter including voting on the matter or must leave the meeting and stay away which the eligible councillors discuss and vote on the matter can i have a plea show of hands today 's councillors determined the council of barnes may participate in the meeting including voting on the matter that 's it so as it is uh they 've been identified unanimously in relation to the item counsellors determined council of barnes is able to to stay and vote on the matter council barnes i just probably i 'm happy if you 're happy he 's probably i 'm always happy mr me know you 've got he 's uh he 's the matter before it 's it 's in your particular area what sorry mr mouth i turned it off that 's all right it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

that sorry mr mayor i didn 't want to make you feel left out still listed on your register it 's registered on my register as a hospitality benefit i don 't believe so yeah you 're neaton so the marriage is how it was wasn 't in this present counselor i think it was a few cases ago i think it was the first council after amalgamation yeah i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts and and so forth as you know yourself i can clarify mr no no it 's good i 'm just trying to help just for um regular keeping purposes i think council demands needs to just have it as a declarable conflict because that 's what you 've got to provide and according to councils in our solicitor that is the correct terminology yeah they understand that council bonds so you want to report it as a therapeutic yeah because you put it as a yeah that 's fair enough so yeah yeah yeah so you 'll have to yeah all right so mr mayor we have to do an amount on that then because it was before the legislation correct yeah okay all right the legislation clearly has changed to something when you accept the people yeah no because it 's a new change in legislation i wasn 't quite sure so mr may with with the leave of council i seek to withdraw my previous declaration and now declare that pursuant to section 150 eq of the local government act 2009 i wish to inform the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conflict of interest the name of the related party is qantas the nature of the relationship is that um some 10 years ago to mark a milestone of qantas relationship with the city of bundaberg all councillors were given a return airfare to bundaberg and that that sponsored hospitality was immediately recorded on my register of interest given that i believe that um it is so far removed and sold and it was applied and applicable to all councils at the time that i can stay in the meeting and vote on the matter thank you councillors i just want to make sure is there anything else in relation to the new legislation that 's declaring an amount or anything else like that there 's nothing uh no so we discussed yeah so i 'll just go straight through one five e q again just to declare it to because we got that legal advice and i want to just make sure it 's fine so if you show it to section one five zero eq of the act council has been formed of a declarable conflict of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can participate and vote on the matter the other councils must decide whether council barnes may participate in a discussion about the matter including voting on the matter or must leave the meeting and stay away which the other uh eligible councillors discuss and vote on the matter can i please have a show of hands for those councils who determine that council of barnes may participate in a meeting including voting on the matter so that those against right so as council has determined that council barnes uh is able to uh to stay and vote on the matter i thank everyone for the patience but we all know the technicalities with these things um what i 'd just like to declare is i never took up on that offer that was made to councillors at the time so i was wasn 't even aware that councillor barnes did so i was a councillor at that time yeah i never took um any um flight thanks councillor honor it matters already been invaded on but yeah okay uh so we 'll now go to if you 're happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise i 'm more than happy to do it for you if you feel uncomfortable about it no i 'm just i 'm extremely comfortable there we go councillors i refer to items as one of the business notes and provide the following background the queensland government has established a five million dollar domestic aviation route restart program the project is a one-off support package responding to the need to stimulate the domestic travel market and a return sorry greg what 's the recommendation first oh sorry the recommendation all right thanks councilman the council authorized the ceo to enter into an arrangement with qantas airways limited for the provision of services eligible for funding by the domestic aviation route restart program without seeking competitive quotations or tend to pursuant to section two three five of local government regulation two now we need a second at his second accounts of bartels now council barnes go for your life that 's what you ever been here mr mayor yes as i said so there 's a bit domestic meetings every every week come along i 'm dedicated mr may so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of the program is to stimulate aviation demand by allowing airports to negotiate directly with airlines to increase service frequency or capacity and by funding marketing and activities in partnership with tourism and events queensland regional tourism organizations linked to the teq tourism events queensland good to go messaging the program does not require a financial contribution by council and it should be noted the council is the owner operator of the bundaberg airport the program is administered through the department of state development tourism and innovation by teq which is notified each quiz and airport how much funding from the program has been allocated to the airport the program 's funding agreement was signed for council and the funds have been received and i guess it 's important here to uh to thank the state government for that funding council has received proposals from qantas to use the funding to support increased capacity on the bundaberg to brisbane return routes and to participate in a marketing promotion in the qantas magazine to target its high-tier frequency fliers who are known to respond to this type of kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cri criteria for funding by the program due to the ongoing ramifications of the pandemic and after qantas resumption of services to bundaberg alliance airlines suspended i just say suspended its operations and terminated its ground handling arrangements at bundaberg at bundaberg consequently there is currently only one airline with whom to negotiate for increased frequency and capacity samara move the recommendation thank you councillor uh barnes any other councils we should raise any queries or speak against the motion no all those in favour those against so move the next item of business is item s2 i call council mcphee thank you mr mayor um i would like to move the

more than 3000 the centre is a valued resource for the community as it 's the only service in the region offering specialised equipment for people with disabilities and cost-effective play

there 's an apology from the mayor council of dempsey who is otherwise engaged uh at uh lgaq policy executive meeting in brisbane uh so that deputy mayor council trevor will be uh taking his place today and i 've been given notice of three conflicts of interest from councillors trevor councillor haberman and council of honour before i go to those councillors to outline what their conflicts are are there any other conflicts that i need to be advised no okay i 'll go around the table council trevor is on a regular basis the nature of the conflict is that michelle thanks trevor council of honorable um thank you councillor honor and councillor uh pursuant to section 150 eq of the local government act i wish to inform the meeting that i have a declarable conflict of interest in relation to item t1 the nature of the conflict of interest is that i 've been a friend of the president of the association is the subject of that item um for for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship so i believe having stated this conflict of interest i believe i can participate and vote on the matter thank you okay we 'll move to the agenda the first item is a petition uh request for a bus stop which is in there for noting any questions or comments on that one councillor barnes how many uh very good question can we take that on notice and come back to you later in the meeting can we get a hold of a copy of it okay um all right uh item the next one was a late item that was distributed or two late items e1 and e2 bundenburg ag tech hub consortium arrangement bin um the next two items are effectively very similar in nature that they both seek the authority uh the authorization for the ceo to enter into memorandum and understanding or consortium agreements which are effectively the same same thing uh the first one 's between uh the the council and cq universe in relation to the uh the bundaberg ag tech hub uh council be aware have been working uh with cqu and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former administration building there at pegara this agreement will says work formally with cqu and other partners but hopefully over the next three years to build out and develop the regional strength in agriculture through the use and adoption of agricultural technology through the hub but also broader regional economic initiatives to to enhance the uh the growth of ag tech innovations across the broader region uh so this this mou is about is it will give some sort of guidance to the relationship between uh the council and university uh one part of the agreement uh is that we will there will be joint appointment of a hub manager that will manage uh the hub to an extent but also the broader initiatives across the region to grow ag tech over the next two years so um that 's at the mo uh the mou or the consortium arrangement with the university um just sort of outlines the roles and responsibilities in that relationship and seeking the ceos uh a resolution for the co to enter into that consortium arrangement with the university uh the second item uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions or comments okay uh the next item uh similar again it 's an mou between uh the council and the queensland department of education this mu mou is to formalize the the the work we 're doing to advance the challenger learning centre uh this relationship will will allow us to sort of uh negotiate on the next level of detail with the department of education around potentially funding a teacher position that would go into the challenger center should it be should it be established and set uh set up and funded um so it 's a fairly simple um relationship between us and department of education um that will guide those negotiations over the the next six to 12 months to try and identify the resources to fund that position should the centre go forward uh thanks ben any comments or questions that 's it thanks um the next item 's a financial summary as of one december simon just would everyone know that simon will be the acting cfo for the next 12 months so he 'll be in the hot seat regularly delivering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ december uh just a few highlights to point out in terms of fee and charge income uh there 's been a considerable volume of commercial waste taken at naba during the month of november so the waste fees are trending higher so far so we 'll make an adjustment in the budget for that there 's also a number of ascounts will be aware of parcels of land particularly down at concunar state which have settled so far this financial year so those two items have seen the recurrent income slightly more than what we had expecting the original budget in terms of recurring expenditure largely that 's on track across the different exponential categories um there is a variation between the funds on depreciation as outlined in previous reports and that again will be adjusted in the half year view to come to council in january the capital expansion program uh the cash flows are largely uh in line with expected outlays we 're expecting obviously as the tenders are resolved and construction will increase in the second half of the financial year in terms of grants there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of funding between projects that 's something that management we 're working on early in the new year terms of cash the balance that the first december was 141.5 million it 's largely in line with expected cash cash flows and there 's no foreseeable liquidity issues in the short term and lastly rate data at first december was 8.6 million that 's the gross amount not including prepayments this time last year that balance was around 5.6 million we are expecting increase in rate payments early in the new year when interest starts to kick in other debtors remain relatively consistent any questions on the financial summary no questions no thanks simon and then you 're going to do the debt policy yep so under section 192 of the local government regulation council is required to adopt a debt policy which outlines its proposed borrowings a recent tender awarded for a key project resulted in changing a project cost a quarterly management determine the best funding strategy for this was to borrow so in order to facilitate a borrowing application prior to the february 2021 deadline we 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one thanks son uh just in response before we move on to the next item in response to council of barnes 's question we had 125 signatures on that petition uh the next item 's a review of the delegation to register christine welcome um this report is in relation to the delegations register so in accordance with section 257 of the local government act um council is required to resolve delegated powers to the mayor or ceo um the register is being updated presently uh because of substantive changes that were made to the local government act and regulation which came into play in october so the uh delegations register has been amended and that report is um and the proposed amendments are provided with the report as to the changes that council officers suggest and the register is available for adoption by council thanks christine questions or comments item g2 is in regard to the sale of three lots at kinkuna waters estate um so council has been working with uh real estate agents for um three buyers they 're interested in lot 13 lot 35 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered for auction but that was unsuccessful and the lots were passed in in accordance to the regulation to apply the exception to having those lots sent through auction or tender again council offices are suggesting that we apply the exception contained in section 2361ai of the local government regulation all of those lots are full market value and the recommendation is that the council applied that exception and authorized the ceo to enter into the contracts and attend to all items so that those matters may be finalized yes thank you nicole there 's five yep yep they 've gone to tender yes closing on the 20th 22nd i believe it is tuesday afternoon at two o 'clock uh we spoke to the agent that sold most of the lots in the existing stage uh he 's producing some promotional material i understand to run over christmas but it was important for council if those last five blocks were sell that over that holiday period we had other blocks available and that tender process will then enable us to offer those to the market and um just to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to council last friday and that 's formed the basis for the tender prices oh sorry for the the reserve prices that 's what i 'm trying to say thanks christine okay nothing else on that one all right we 'll move on to infrastructure stuart welcome councillors this report seeks your authorization to purchase atlas software from the suppliers without first seeking quotes from other potential suppliers the software in particular complements our traffic counting software which is metro account and to our understanding there is only one supplier of this software the purchase of this software will result in significant time savings for staff and it would be impractical to invite quotes when there is only one supplier hence the recommendation that council resolves in accordance with section 235 b of the regulations thanks stuart comments or questions well thank you uh next item 's l1 council trevor 's declared conflict he 's going to locate the chamber welcome sarah you 're going to do both planning ones you 're lucky all right uh material changing news for the tourist park at the smartwood gate uh good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning item l1 deals with a development application for a material change you use for a tourist park located at 86 to 88 esplanade woodgate beach uh the proposal involves the expansion of the existing nrma woodgate beach tourist park in the balance area that was recently created under a development permit for a reconfiguration of a lot the proposal involves 19 additional caravan sites two freestanding ensuites sites and an internal uh roadway the ensuite structures are proposed three metres from the northeastern property boundary with access via the western elevation only the caravan sites measure 10 meters by 10 meters and are accessed via a one-way internal roadway that comes off the existing internal roadway from the esplanade the applicant has provided a three metre landscaping buffer along all boundaries which interface with existing residential dwellings and the subject site has an area of 4.1 hectares the site also has as well as frontage to uh the esplanade wood gate the site has frontage to acacia street pine court and cassia court with that with vehicle access only via the espionage the application was subject to impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the planning act council received 26 prop submissions during the public notification period with 22 of these being properly made issues raised by submitters included shortage of amenities commercial use of residential land road construction standard of the esplanade need demand density and impact to residential amenity the assessment undertaken by officers has highlighted some key planning issues a consideration within the higher order outcomes of the planning scheme is need within the application material the applicant put forward evidence that there is a need for the existing tourist park to expand with the applicant stating that caravan park has increased a 50 percent increase in demand for powered sites for caravans since 2017 the applicant also confirmed that their existing tourist park is uh regularly at full capacity during peak season officers also note that this tourist park is only one of two in woodgate village with the woodgate hotel offerings 27 caravan parks it is considered that there is a need for further caravan sites in the woodgate village councillors you 'll note that density was another consideration by officers the relocatable home park tourist park code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing tourist park has a density of 45.4 sites per hectare the proposal very slightly increases that density of 46.5 sites per hectare which is only an increase of 1.1 sites per hectare officers believe this is still keeping with the intent of that code it is also noted within the report that buffering treatments include three metres of landscaping along property boundaries which are joined residential properties and a two metre high solid screen fence uh councillors something that should be noted within the report before you is the conditions relating to building setbacks in condition 7 will be updated to reflect the lot numbering of the adjoining properties being lots 2 and 3 on sp 31551 rather than the northern property boundary just to give absolute clarity on the setbacks of these ensuite structures it 's considered that these buffering outcomes also meet the measures of the relocatable home tourist park code councils you 'll find in the report assessment undertaken by officers against the low density zone code as the expansion area is zoned low density residential under the planning scheme a tourist park does fall under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposal complies with all requirements of this zone code the last notable planning consideration within the report is roadways and access the submitted application includes commentary and notes on the plan for access to pine court for maintenance and emergency access only however there is an access restriction strip at the end of pine court and the application does not include the access restriction allotment as within the application offices are of the view that there is sufficient access to the site via existing access to the esplanade as such a condition restricting access to pine court is recommended the standard of the condition of the esplanade was also considered this is included within discussions uh this included discussions with council 's road corridor team it was found that the esplanade isn 't of an appropriate standard with existing capacity for the proposed expansion the applicant has also confirmed that they 've recently implemented an online check-in system this system allows for guests to check in online and proceed directly to their allocated site upon real arrival at the time the application was lodged 23 of guests were using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application against the planning scheme officers conclude that the application complies with or can be conditioned to comply with the all relevant assessment but benchmarks and approval of this application is recommended by officers thanks sarah comments and questions all right okay l2 thanks oh sorry we 'll get bill back oh yeah all right councillors item l2 deals with the development application for a preliminary approval for a material change of use being stage 2 of the burnet heads boat harbour village which is a mixed use development and includes a resort complex with ancillary shops restaurants bar recreation and conference conference facilities short-term accommodation and multiple dwellings incorporate incorporating a component to vary the effect of the bundaberg regional council planning scheme 2015 under section 61 of the planning act uh councillors you 'd all be very familiar with this site as this site is the same site as last month 's stage one application so in my presentation today i 'll focus on the key points of difference of this application rather than repeating what was already presented to you last meeting which included site history zoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit a preliminary approval does not authorize the carrying out of accessible development what a preliminary approval does is act as a guide for future development applications lodged and assessed against the requirements laid out in the conditions of the preliminary approval a preliminary approval is considered the most appropriate approval mechanism to allow for a fully master planned larger development it is considered to give certainty to the applicant to move forward with detailed design for the stage two of this boat harbour village the application before you also includes a variation request to vary the effect of the planning scheme to secure approval for the overall development concept for stage 2 and guide the assessment level and subsequent applications for development permits lodged over this site the preliminary approval component proposes a series of residential billing buildings which are distributed along the waterfront to the east of the already approved stage one village center these comprise a mix of product type including eight times two level eco villas eight three level waterfront fillers six two six level apartment buildings each comprising 70 units for the use of either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each comprising 85 units for the use of either multiple dwelling units or short-term accommodation a 10-storey resort complex with associated conference three-level conference facilities recreation restaurant and retail facilities the resort complex is located centrally on the small peninsula of the south north south portion of the site the resort complex overlooks the large pool residential buildings are angled inside and offset from each other which officers agree creates an interesting built edge varying height which maximizes views to the marina and ocean for future residents lower building heights are generally positioned closer to the edge of the site with gaps between the buildings to provide view lines from the marina and hub esplanade the public promenade continues along the water 's edge in front of all buildings this is linked by pathways to additional barbecue and picnic areas and a small beach providing public access to in the entire waterfront edge of the site a series of other pathways link between the buildings to connect harbour esplanade to the promenade similar to stage one vehicle access is provided through an entry boulevard which includes a roundabout to direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resort buildings is provided in basements beneath each field building with visitor parks at grade for the resort complex a key assessment benchmark is the relocatable home and tourist park code as discussed in the report the purpose of this code is to ensure that tourist parks are appropriately located and designed in a manner which meets the needs of residents and visitors and predict protects the amenity of surrounding premises an assessment of the proposal against the applicable performance outcomes of this code has demonstrated the proposal generally generally complies or can be conditioned to comply with this code a key issue discussed in the report before you is height similar to stage one application the subject site is located within the community facility zone this community facility zone does not specify a maximum building height given this zoning is historical and not in keeping with the long-term vision for the site like stage one officers have turned to other key relevant matters providing guidance on what might be an appropriate maximum building height the applicant proposes the result complex to be 10 stories in height with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnet heads local area plan that was prepared in 2017 by council however since the burnet heads local area plan was endorsed by council other relevant planning matters in relation to heights have overtaken that within the local plan one important relevant planning matter being the minister for state development and manufacturing and planning 's calling reassessment and decision on the 26th of april 2019 for the esplanade jewel application which was located in a neighbouring coastal community bagara and that site was zoned high density residential the second most relevant matter in relation to building heights is the state directed temporary local planning instrument for building heights and sea turtle sensitive areas which also came into effect since the adoption of the burnet heads local area plan the applicant was requested within council 's information request to provide further grounds for the proposed height over an over and above that envisage for other coastal areas the applicant did not prepare and submit the requested information rather provide a justification for the ten stories from a turtle management perspective given officers do not have detailed design plans demonstrating compliance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is recommended that heights above six stories be subject to impact assessment and the entire planning scheme be an applicable assessment benchmark including the strategic framework furthermore this will enable the community to have their input and views on detailed design in the circumstance any application over this height is lodged and assessed by council in this regard officers recommended a variation to the planning scheme differing to what the applicant has requested be conditioned the submitted height master plan is also recommended to be approved as amended by council with a condition confirming that the maximum height be six stories uh a second differing issue to stage one application is that the proposal includes a public beach which is located on the northern tip of the subject site it is unclear within the applicant 's submitted material how the day-to-day operations of this beach is proposed considering the pedestrian pathways to this beach which is essentially contained within a private resort council would not be able to access and maintain this beach given its location due to public accessibility it will require public right-of-way easement similar to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed path in stage two to provide certainty to officers on how this beach will be maintained and operated it is recommended that a condition of approval require the applicant to prepare a beach management plan just to ensure the safety of the community and users of that beach a la the last component of the preliminary approval i draw your attention to is conditions relating to services and infrastructure unlike conditions for a development permit conditions for the subject preliminary approval has been kept very high level with requirements for the applicant to demonstrate that all regular services and infrastructure to be incorporated and detailed designed for future applications which will be assessed by officers at such time these will be required to be provided in accordance with the planning scheme the applicant has requested to vary the effect of the planning scheme to be in line with the submitted stage 2 master plan and the zoning to be high density residential and the associated levels of assessment to facilitate the development of the site be in line with the submitted master plan it is considered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional council planning scheme are generally appropriate other than the proposed building heights above six stories and these will allow the developer to deliver the intended character for the area the application before you was also subject to public notification and was notified for 30 business days in accordance with the requirements of the planning act a total of 30 uh 43 submissions were made and three not properly made submissions counsellors you will note that within section 8 of the report there are only 42 addresses listed this is because two different submissions were received by one submitter they were both counted as properly made however their address is only listed once key issues raised within the submissions included level of assessment for future applications timing of public notification lighting impacts to sea turtles building height storm-type inundation impacts on wildlife and the environment character visual amenity zoning open space landscaping state government assessment and stormwater all of these matters have been considered in the report before you it should also be noted that queensland treasury were a referral agency for works within the coastal management district and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two referral triggers and provided approval subject to conditions on a letter dated 13th of march 2020 which is included as an attachment to the report council is just following a review of the report last night officers do think they should be one more addition to section seven in the reasons for decision given the outcomes of the states calling an assessment of the dual application and the subsequent tlpi relating to heights in neighbouring bagara the tlpi will be added by offices as a material on which the findings of this report were based a last point of clarification i should also draw your attention to is within the advice notes to be placed on the decision notice relating to infrastructure charges this is currently pointing to the charges notice for stage one this will be updated to reflect that the charges for all future applications under the preliminary preliminary approval will be charged in accordance with infrastructure policy at the time any application is lodged no charges are applicable for the application before you in summary it is recommended the report before you for the preliminary approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a preliminary approval council will be assessing all future applications and be in control of design outcomes for these future applications and will be able to enforce detailed conditions on these applications at such time they are lodged and assessed by council thanks sarah very comprehensive uh comments and questions thank you uh the next item is oh one elise christine councillors item 01 is in regard to 14 schooling windermere which is the old brolin state school site this land is state owned reserve which council is the trustee of the lions club of pagar has been working with council over the last couple of years to identify a site where they may establish a storage shed for their van that they use in emergency sorry emergency matters and that they you know supply food and things from from their food van um council officers have identified uh part of the land at school lane um and the group would like to enter into a 10-year lease at the community rate of 55 inclusive gst with the club being responsible for all costs associated with the lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception to the matter being disposed of by lease rather than going through auction or tender given that it 's a community organization and the recommendation is that council applied that exception contained in section 2361b given that it 's a community organization and that the ceo be authorised to enter into a 10-year lease with the lions club of bagara for part of the land uh thanks christine questions or comments council of arms thank you mr russia i wasn 't president with the last club care of a presentation i think last week but i think this is extremely encouraging given the extensive actions not only to their members but also to other um thanks kim thanks council barnes any other comments or questions so item o2 is in regard to the renewal of the lease for community lifestyle support community lifestyle support are housed as well they have a lease over that same property at school lane in windermere their lease is due to expire in june 2022 part of the area that they lease will be reduced to accommodate the lions club which community lifestyle support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their site uh the new lease will be um on an initial term of five years rent will be at market value and they will be responsible for their outgoings pursuant to the lease and it 's suggested that council apply the exception contained in tech section 2361c3 of the local government regulation given that the disposal of the land is for the purpose of renewing a lease to an existing tenant thank you christine comments or questions okay thanks councillors item 03 is in regard to a renewal of a lease to telstra corporation telstra owned have a lease of a part of the property at lot 4 at buxton road isis river this property is currently listed on council 's website for sale subject to that lease the telstra corporation are requesting a lease of 10 years with a further 10 years on top of that and it 's proposed again that council apply the exception in section 2361 three given that it 's a disposal of land for the purpose of renewing a lease to an existing tenant of that land thanks christine any comments or questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the area that telstra lease on the is it just for like a piece of equipment or something yeah it 's a repeater station so it 's a little bit larger than um you know like an actual monopole site but um in the context of how big that actual lot is it 's only a very small area and um the advertisement for the sale of that land does say that it 's subject to that list as well oh yes all right nothing else on that one thank you we move into s1 gavin morning councillors morning members of the gallery um i 'm dealing with item s1 uh sol supplier arrangement with qantas airways limited uh councils might be aware that throughout covert there was a an incentive program effectively provided by the queensland government which was called the domestic aviation route restart program to address the fact that um airline industry had been particularly hard hit as had the tourism industry as a result of covert and they were seeking to support a particularly regional airports in trying to get back to pre-covert conditions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger demand so council was provided a grant to assist with that process um i provided some feedback to councillors that we had had some initial discussions at the time with both alliance airlines who were flying at the time um and also qantas uh to see what we could do to directly incentivize and effectively get bums on seats they indicated at that point in time that they were limited in their fleet their processes to bring planes back onto line is quite an extensive process from a regulatory point of view so once they 're parked up they have to and their pilots haven 't been flying for a while they 've got a bit polish they 've got to go through retraining process and the planes themselves have to effectively go through a whole hip to of startup and start down processes so until the demand was there they weren 't likely to automatically put new planes on and so they indicated to us when we talked to them about this funding that um there probably wasn 't a great deal that could be done in regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money came through tourism events queensland as the government agency that we report to and signed the agreement with we then worked with our regional tourism organisations had bundaberg tourism to look at alternatives and ask them for a proposal they put together a marketing proposal from a marketing company in brisbane we looked at that and reviewed it about the same time alliance notified us that they were effectively suspending their bundaberg brisbane service and wouldn 't continue until demand came back so we only really had qantas operating the proposal that we got back via bundleback tourism was predominantly a marketing campaign that seemed to focus more on drive traffic rather than airport traffic um and councils are probably well aware the fact that from a drive perspective our holiday parks were full and that a lot of people were already traveling and particularly drive the drive market anyway so we really wanted to incentivize the airport specifically and particularly the airlines so qantas recently came back to us as our only provider at the moment with an alternate proposal which is to effectively directly target their frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature have a propensity to fly regularly they already have all their contact details so they can direct market to them and put a proposal to us to say that they think they could generate more interest that way and but the issue we have is because they are the only provider we have to effectively go to council under our procurement guidelines as a sole supplier so we haven 't ratified or agreed to anything at this point in time but we this is i guess the first step in having those discussions and trying to advance those with the view that our intention is to try to get as many people flying obviously between brisbane and bundaberg as possible once that happens qantas will likely put on additional flights and then that might encourage alliance to once again return so this report is really just to get council 's approval to enter into um and deal directly with qantas as a sold supplier happy to take any questions yeah just uh through the ceo um gary i guess the selling point in in the report is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its operations i think the suspension is the is um the driving word there if you like so they haven 't actually cancelled their operations they 've suspended their operations at this point in time that 'd be correct uh that 's right and then listen they 've been a great company to deal with they were the only airline that operated throughout covet so they continued to provide services although limited but obviously when it came to the end of that they had to make some financial decisions about where the demand was um but they 've indicated when they had the discussion with us about the suspension that they would be looking to come back so that 's great and obviously we 're hopeful that happens sooner rather than later thanks kev uh next item s2 councils this is a partnership and sponsored green application so councils might well be aware of the toy library that operates um ymca have taken over a responsibility for that particular service in the bundaberg disability resource centre each year the toy library has approached council seeking our financial support to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ten thousand dollars in in the current budget we also have ten thousand dollars towards that um this is really just coming to council to um i guess one make councils aware of the fact that we provide this support um and i guess to once again seek to renew this effectively and provide the ten thousand dollar support for the current 20 20 21 financial year uh for operation of the tour library have you take any questions oh good thanks gavin there 's no other later on so we 've got one item in confidential so i 'll ask the gallery to locate while we consider that one please you,"(-24.8661482,

council trevor used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr mayor the background to this is that in 2010 council engaged the consultant to consolidate the pathway strategies of bundaberg city and bernardshire councils the aim of this document was to develop a pathway hierarchy classification based on link functions and categorize the proposed pathway network two to develop pathway construction standards three to develop a methodology to prioritize pathway projects and four provide a base for development of an integrated structured pathway network in 2012 council adopted the multimodal pathway strategy for use as a planning document for the pathway infrastructure in the bundebeg region this document was used to deliver pathway projects via day labor crews or small quote packages through local concreters during the 2014-15 financial year council zen road and drainage department in pursuit of cost savings made the decision to bundle all pathway projects into one major contract to manage the risk associated with delivering contracts of this size required specific skills and consistency of staff this continuity of staff within the planning and delivery of pathways has resulted in a greater understanding of the issues associated with the pathway planning and limitations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multimodal pathway strategy began providing an opportunity to apply the improved knowledge and learnings of the pathway and cycle infrastructure to address some of the limitations identified with the existing strategy during the course of this review it became apparent that a significant amount of changes were required to bring this document in line with the best practice for transport planning of pathways and cycleways the biggest change identified mr mayor in pathway planning since the 2012 adoption of the multimodal strategy is the evolution from multimodal pathways to an active transport network an active transport network while providing the same transport related outcomes of a multimodal network as identified above also has a focus on health social environmental related outcomes an active transport strategy aims to develop facilities that one provide connectivity to the community for those who rely on public transport and non-motorised modes of transport to get around create opportunity for people to integrate physical activity into their daily lives and three improve the health and physical wellbeing of the community by encouraging promoting physical activity the active transport strategy 202025 document has been developed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we move into the current multimodal pathway strategy to a high standard and function move from the current multimodal pathway strategy to a high standard and functional active transport network this will improve the connectivity and amenity of the pathway network with a view to encouraging more people to get active and engaged within the community i also point out mr mayor to uh councillors that council has been extremely active in the pathway network program over the past four years and in last year 's budget as well delivering uh for the people of bundaberg regional council area thank you

projects at all or whether in fact it 's not really something that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy for others there i can make comment on that i do i do believe we have in the process but also once this is adopted we 'll be further ongoing discussions with uh queensland transport main roads so depending on funding available from different sources as well and what i 'll also do is i 'll also defer as well to stuart randall general manager because there has been extensive uh consultation yeah yes mr mayor um it isn 't a set and forget approach so we will continue as the deputy mayor said to liaise with the department of transport and remain roads to ensure that both our network planning and their network planning a hand in glove for the future thank thank you uh uh sir randall the

that please well second there is councillor haberman does any other councils wish to raise any queries or respect well before going to there is mr ceo do you like to make a comment read the recommendation uh just very briefly mr may thank you the purpose and the general effect of the proposed amendment is to clarify and provide improved guidance for bonding of development works including requirements for uncompleted works bonds as security to enable early approval of a survey plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of bonds including performance bonds and maintenance bonds currently addressed in the on maintenance procedure section of the policy council advertised the proposed amendment and received no submissions and the purpose of bringing that forward to the council is really in response to what 's happening locally in the development industry as you 've been aware there 's been a real spike in applications at the moment we have roughly about twice the number of applications in our system development applications that we had at the same time last year so it 's in response to that to try and provide i guess to to expedite the approval process and to assist uh developers thank you uh ceo steve johnson uh i 'll now put any other council which ways any queries or speak against the motion no i 'll now put the matter to the vote all those in favor those against so moved i 'll just ask for counsellor honor to come back so the next item is item k2 proposed amendment to the bundaberg regional council planning scheme 2015. uh i now move the recommendation uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister 's guidelines and rules council decide to make an amendment to the bundaberg regional council planning scheme and b the chief executive officer be authorised to write to the actual planning minister to request an extension of temporary local planning instrument number one of 2019 as it relates to building heights at bagara for a minimum of 12 months to allow sufficient time for the amendment to be prepared and adopted in accordance with the minister 's rules and guidelines can i have a second to please the second that is councillor cooper uh counts i 'll just mr ceo i 'd like to comment in relation that uh thank you mr mayor uh just very briefly councillors would be aware that a tlpi has been in place to control uh building heights at bagara since may 2019 the minister 's tlpi has effect for two years so it expires in may 2021 uh the purpose of this report and the recommendation is to allow the council to change its planning scheme to reflect the control mechanisms that are currently in the tlpi bearing in mind that the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council to change the planning scheme that gives i guess more certainty and more longevity to those controls but in order to do that and go through the process that 's specified in the planning act uh council needs to contact the minister 's office to see if they 'll agree to extend the tlpi so that we 're not trying to rush that process through bearing in mind we 've just had a state government election a new planning minister and it 's highly unlikely that anything 's going to happen before february even with the government now in office thank you mr ceo i 'll now ask does any other councils wish to raise any queries or speak against the motion no all those in favor those against councillor barnes so noted the matter is moved the next item of business is item k3 it 's a proposed minor amendment to the bundaberg regional council planning scheme 2015. councillor trevor uh has declared a

zone um basically an ocean 14 utility installation to lots 2 3 and 6 on w39500 and lot 2 on rp 14424 located at goodwood road and brown 's road childers and b decide to adopt the proposed minor amendments and incorporate their mended zone maps into the bundaberg regional council planning scheme effective as of the fourth of the zen december 2020. can i have a second to play second is councillor honour mr ceo let 's speak further in relation to this it 's uh it certainly has um uh been a great effort by council getting this together in such a short period of time uh yeah thank you mr mayor um isa central sugar mill contacted uh council staff about two to three weeks ago in relation to some planned changes in the way in which cane loading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently included in a community facility zone under council 's planning scheme and given the range of uses covered by the zone council zoning maps um we believe need to be changed to facilitate that change the use of a land for a cane railway and associated loading and unloading facility um is probably not compatible with that zoning so the purpose of this amendment is to minor amendment is to facilitate uh those changed arrangements that the mill wants to put in place uh at the at the children 's cane line and uh the the amendment will will also remove the need for any uh application or assessment against the relevant assessment benchmarks in the planning scheme thanks mr ceo any other councillors wish to raise any queries or speak against the motion no i 'll put the matter to the vote all those in favor those against so moved the next item of business is item k4 i acknowledge councillor trevor and councillor honour declared a conflict of interest in this item and will leave the meeting thanks council honor yeah item k4 is uh from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation again as seen on the screen and before us that pursuant to the planning act 2016 and the minister 's guidelines and rules council a adopted planning scheme policy for agricultural buffers incorporating changes as a consequence of submissions made through public consultation noting that the changes have not resulted in the policy being sufficiently different to the version released for public consultation and b make an administrative amendment to part 1 table 1.2.5 planning scheme policy for the planning scheme to reflect the adoption of the planning scheme policy for agricultural buffers and c incorporate the policy into the bundaberg regional council 's planning scheme effective as of the 4th of december 2020. can i have a second to place second is councillor bartels there 's any other before speak asking any councils the ceo i 'll ask you to give us a um some details in relation to this particular matter uh thank you mr mayor the new policy seeks to provide guidance for the design construction and ongoing maintenance of agricultural buffers to minimise potential conflicts between agricultural operations and sensitive land uses for example residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development proposed adjacent to agricultural land uses to limit impact on lawful agricultural operations and it provides appropriate design considerations and maintenance advice to ensure buffers are effective in mitigating off-farm impacts adjacent to sensitive land uses and it supports applicants in satisfying the requirements of the planning scheme and to assist development assessment officers in their assessment of new development applications that require agricultural buffers importantly we went through quite extensive uh public consultation we received eight property made submissions but i think it 's also worth noting that council staff during that period presented to the isis cane growers on the 23rd of september and also to the managing director of the bundaberg fruit and vegetable growers on the 29th of september and sent out reminder emails to all local development industry and agricultural sector representative groups to make sure that everyone was fully aware of what the proposed policy was intended to do and to seek submissions as to their thoughts or views on that policy thanks mr ceo i just also want to comment by way that it 's a big thank you to staff for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have this recommendation before us i 'll just ask there 's any other councils wish to raise any queries

item is item k-5 it 's a material chains of use for mixed-use development in burnet burnet harbour marine village in relation to the office the shop food and drink outlets indoor sport and recreation short-term accommodation and multiple dwellings at six seven harbour espionage burnet heads the recommendations basically put forward is that i now move that the development application to 55.2018.89.1 detailed within the report and also be decided as per the recommendation you can have a second to please secondary uh councillor or councillor mclaughlin uh do i have any other council well before do that or call council mr ceo i 'd like to speak on this this is this is a very exciting project and there is a number of conditions uh in relation to this particular project but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mr mayor i might might take some time just to highlight what this application is intending to do the applicant seeks to create a landmark development for the bundaberg region incorporating a master planned harbour village precinct with retail office club cafe recreation short and long-term accommodation uses in a marina setting the applicant contends that these activities will occur in attractive architecturally designed buildings that range in height from single level to five levels the proposal can be summarised as follows the creation of a commercial centre located adjacent to the existing public parking area boat ramp and jetty and it comprises a compact grouping of single two and three-story buildings sited along the water 's edge activities proposed in this cluster include a ground floor convenience store chandelier fashion gift souvenirs etc real estate cafe bakery and administration and then a gymnasium spa retail and restaurant in the third building three apartment buildings are distributed along the waterfront to the east of the commercial centre these are four and five level residential buildings available for both permanent occupation and short-term accommodation the buildings are angled in planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sinuous built edge all apartment buildings have underground car parking and a foreshore promenade footpath extends for the full harbour frontage of the development side public pathways connect harbour esplanade to the promenade and the plans identified as road access subject to future dnr me approval in relation to vehicle access to the road that serves the public boat ramp jetty and parking area whilst use of this road in association with public recreation facilities is understood to be acceptable under the recreation reserve status use of the road in association with the commercial development is understood to be unacceptable vehicle access from the development side to this road is therefore contingent upon the developer the council gladstone ports corporation and the department of natural resources mines and energy agreeing to change part of the recreation reserve to a road reserve and as i said quite extensive as the mayor said quite extensive conditions attached to that uh proposed approval thank you mr mayor thank you mr ceo does any other council wish to raise any queries or speak against

AUS,QLD,Bundaberg Regional Council,Bundaberg Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/user/BundabergRC,Bundaberg Regional Council - Briefing Meeting - 18 November 2020,mOuhfWySFYo,20201117,3557.92,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",7379,so now live everyone uh good morning everybody and welcome to the briefing meeting for november uh given the changes to the recent changes to the local government act and regulation in relation to conflicts of interest from now on at the briefing meeting we 'll go around the table and ask the councillors to declare which items they have a conflict in which will be the items that next week when we have the full council meeting that will also they will mirror the the same conflicts next week at the ordinary council meeting i 'll go first is uh neil mr ceo thank you mr mayor council mcphee the lease has no relevance to the meeting item and it won 't income won 't impact the outcome of the item so i will be choosing to stay in the room if my fellow councillors allow me to council honor um um thank you councillor honor council trevor uh thank you mr ceo i will be declaring an interest in k3 uh the in agricultural buffers the interest is that in that report cane railway is operated by isis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in central sugar limited and i will be leaving the room when that item is discussed thank you council martel no conflicts yes mr ceo i have a declarable conflict of interest for item 04 and it 's at least overlooked 35 on sp 2 5 4 5 4 6. i have no conflicts with er so yeah no conflicts thank you no conflicts thank you very much all right um we will start the first item which is the financial summary as of 2nd of november anthony welcome sorry mr ceo can i just buy it it 's greg oh sorry councillor barnes i forgot you were there yeah the um i had a lot of trouble uh hooking in there so i can only hear some councillors and that now but uh just for the record i have no declarable interest thank you i apologize i didn 't include you no that 's right good morning council um yeah so we 've got the finance summary there to the 2nd of november and just a few highlights the progress check to date is about 34 as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the rates that we raised expenditure is pretty close on target with around about 34 and the capital activities our capital expenditure is about 26 which is in line with our expectations this point in time just on the recurrent revenue uh the fees and charges are slightly more than the budget to date and we 've had some uh increased activity obviously in the development area and there 's also significant recovery works that has been undertaken on the interest revenue side slightly lower to offset that and as we all know the interest rates is basically at historic lows at the moment and probably looks to be that way for a number of years going forward just another note there is that council has uh settled on a number of uh unconditional contracts for the sale of land um and which we don 't normally budget for and you 'll see there 's about five hundred thousand dollars uh in the in the uh revenue for that and we 've got potentially uh somewhere between three and six hundred thousand uh more revenue to come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget and in january with an update on those sales on the recurrent expenditure side um everything is basically as is tracking as per budget other than the depreciation just on the depreciation note there we had a significant increase in our valuations for water assets in particular at the 30th of june and last year and our depreciation has been adjusted accordingly so we 're expecting about 1.5 million increase in depreciation this year as i said the capital expenditure is 26 percent uh which is in line with where we believed all the forecasts was the cash um has decreased since the last uh report by about 14.4 million dollars once again that 's pretty much in line with what our forecast as you can see in the graph below where we 're trending on downward cycle until the next rate run on the rates data we 're currently about the 31st of october we had about 10.5 million dollars outstanding in rates and that 's compared to was about um 6.4 at the same time last year the at the moment we have uh advanced payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um at the right now is about 9.2 so we have a net outstanding rates of about 2.6 uh in previous years we 're already into a um a credit balance with the advanced payments uh not significantly worse of them um given the covert and everything else that 's going on um but uh yeah so it 's it 's still pleasing to see that we 've got 6.8 million in rates paid in advance on the other debtors and just to note that with the infringements we 've had no write-offs and infringement so far this year and that 's partly because we set up a infrastructure charges sorry not infrastructure yeah infringement charges a working group that works through the processes and i think some of the rewards are starting to reflect out of that and a number of audits that we 've had in over the last couple of years and just a final note uh we 're looking to refresh the uh council report for um future meetings and we 'll probably bring that back to a consult meeting going forward and we just had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting to their monthly meetings for councils and we 've um identified a few tweets that we can make to this report make it hopefully more informative to council thank you thanks anthony uh comments or questions just one from me steve thanks oh you 've got one yeah it 's greg yep council barnes yeah good anthony um the next round of grants we budgeted in the current budget or have we put it through into the the next year 's budget yeah at this stage we 've um budgeted that we would receive the advanced payment as per usual right okay thanks thank you thanks thank you anthony uh next item is in relation to some land sales christine is that working yes um uh in regard to item g1 this report is about sales of land in kinkuna waters estate um presented there are five lots under separate contracts to separate buyers um that council is proposing to have the exception in the uh local government regulation applied given that those lots have previously been offered through uh tender or auction previously um the five lots are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks christine any questions or comments council trevor i 'll just make a comment it 's good to see that previous land sales there are turning into house constructions there 's four new homes going up in there over the last couple of months which is exciting thank you um item g2 yes item g2 is in regard to the sale of lots in heritage oaks estate which is in childers so there are two lots in there that council has been uh liaising with a real estate agent for two separate buyers for lot 19 and lot 21 in that estate both contracts are proposed for market value and again council officers propose that council apply the exception contained in the local government regulation given that the lots have previously been offered through tender auction process and that the ceo um be authorized to enter into those contracts and finalize those sales thanks christine any comments or questions no okay thank you uh next item 's h1 active transport strategy thank you council honor it so hopefully it 'll pick up yeah so the active transport strategy is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the last little while this is the the first one that actually gets to the point of present presentation to council for adoption it is uh the transition strategy from the old multimodal pathway strategy which effectively is pathways and cycleways it is moving towards a new concept of active transport which is more encompassing of different user groups uh it 's a uh an unusual strategy in that it is a living breathing document it 's not a set and forget uh will be continually evolved and modified through the the life of the document over five years it includes an action plan which is primarily the construction of and reconstruction of existing pathway infrastructure within the region so i 'm very happy to be able to present this document to you for uh for adoption thanks stuart uh questions or comments oh must have done an excellent job thanks and then we moved into some planning items michael are you presenting those sarah okay okay one uh thanks cancer honor it uh good morning councillors um the first item uh car item k1 relates to a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council will be well aware the planning minister introduced tlpi number one of 2019 bugara building height and sea turtle sensitive area on 30th of may 2019 that tlpi had a life expectancy sorry has a life of two years meaning it 's due to expire in may next year the sea turtle sensitive area provisions uh have already been incorporated just wait councilman did we skip have we skipped an item i 've got the same agenda that you have have we renumbered sorry the there was a late report about uh development application is that the one that we 're missing uh no k1 on my agenda was the uncompleted work spawns ah okay well uh rewind i 'll go to uh that report unless i 've got a different agenda to everyone else sorry i apologize council uh evan my wingman is uh stuck at the dentist and had hoped to get here in time but uh he 's obviously uh still under the in the careful hands of his dentist something for you to get your teeth into there michael yeah hopefully hopefully i don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you oh jeez thanks your day jobs boys thanks to cole he 's fanging to get back tommy oh no actually he did have an interest in this machine here today right back to k-1 as per the agenda michael uh thank you ceo my apologies council uh council recall at the ordinary meeting of 29th of september uh that it resolved to make an amendment to its planning scheme policy uh for development works pursuant to the planning act and the minister 's guidelines and rules those amendments were primarily around providing improved guidance for bonding of development works including requirements for uncompleted works bonds to enable early survey plan sealing and better guidance for the requirements for other bonds including performance and maintenance bonds following that resolution public consultation on the proposed amendments were was undertaken from the 9th of october to the 6th of november this year and no submissions were received details of the consultation activities undertaken were are included in the report given that there were no submissions received the report recommends that the changes as previously presented but now be formally adopted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay uh k2 and we can get councillor honor back for this one there 's nobody in k2 had a conflict all right thank you mr ceo uh councillors i 'll speed the background about the minister 's tlpi again as far to say that the minister and the department have made it clear that they expect council to take action on the remaining part of the minister 's tlpi that hasn 't been incorporated in the scheme which is the bagara building heights elements as council recall we 've previously advised the minister that we were looking forward to the outcomes from our low glo project that we ran over the the last turtle season uh however there 's been further time needed to analyze the data that 's coming out of that study and to formulate proposals for addressing the results that are being observed so on that basis council today um presenting a report for the next meeting to consider that one that the council resolved to amend uh the planning scheme to start the process uh and uh two uh that we write to the uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the existing tlpi to allow uh council more time to draft that amendment and submit it for state interest review thanks michael comments your questions council mcphee i just had a question michael that in the recommendation the part a that we resolve to amend the planning scheme or start to amend the planning scheme that will be happen when we get the results from the urban glo project is that correct uh council through the chair the um the process under the minister 's guidelines and rules for amending doing a major amendment planning scheme uh the first step of that is for council to resolve to to amend the planning scheme so at this point it 's on this area to determine exactly what that amendment will be um and as that work is progressed by officers we will bring that back to council for further consideration and uh formal resolution before we submit uh anything uh to the planning minister any other questions yeah one from me steve council barnes yeah okay so basically um recommendation a is asking us to make a decision to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want know what that amendment might include through the through the chair counsellor that 's uh that 's correct um however you know the council there are multiple sort of gateways decision gateways for the council to decide whether to proceed with that amendment including before we send an office that interest review to the planning minister when we decide to go to public consultation once we send it back to the minister post consultation and then finally uh before the any amendment 's adopted uh as a final step uh the council has to resolve to actually um yeah adopt uh that amendment so this is really uh getting council resolution on the books to say that we um the council is happy to start the process i mean i do i do have some problems with that councillors i mean we 're making the decision to definitely make an amendment to the uh planning scheme when we don 't know what that amendment may or may not be and we know how sensitive this particular issue is i would hope that we could have perhaps canvassed some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barnes can i just make a comment uh this was discussed uh at a consultation day uh which you may not have been at but i think the important thing is it 's not recommendation a it 's recommendation b so recommendation b continues the tlpi which restricts the building heights for 12 months to give the council an opportunity to then look at what that amendment to the planning scene is which is a more permanent arrangement for at least for the next four or five years so i understand what you 're saying but as michael 's also pointed out while it might appear open-ended there will be nothing that will go to the minister to amend the planning scheme without a council resolution so you 're very clear and the community we will be very clear on what that amendment is yep sorry just a further point of clarification too mr ceo the act does allow that at any point during that process the council uh can make a decision to not proceed uh with the amendment as well well that being the case then should the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an amendment rather than us actually making the decision right now i think that 's a statutory requirement is it michael yeah so it 's worded like that council of barnes because that 's a statutory requirement under the planning act to commence the press okay okay accept that all right any more questions on that one comment no uh okay k3 mr ceo i will mr ceo i 'll be declaring on the day so i 'm going to leave the room all right michael back to you ceo uh councillors uh you recall that uh meeting of uh 25th of august uh 2020 the council formally resolved to prepare a uh playing scheme uh policy uh for agricultural buffers in accordance with the statutory requirements that policy sought to provide guidance for the design construction ongoing maintenance of ag agricultural buffers to minimise conflicts between incompatible uses namely residential development and those and sort of more intensive agricultural and other rural uses inform the design of new residential development proposed adjacent to agricultural uses to limit the impact on those existing lawful activities to provide appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective in mitigating off farm impacts and to support applicants in satisfying the requirements of the planning scheme primarily providing some off-the-shelf solutions for or deemed to comply solutions for developers to adopt should they wish but noting that the planning scheme still left it open for them to develop specific solutions for their own individual developments following uh council 's resolution officers undertook public consultation of the proposed planning scheme policy for 20 business days from 11th of september to the 13th of october 2020 which resulted in eight uh properly made uh submissions uh the activities uh that were undertaken are detailed there uh in the report uh and we did uh receive submissions uh from a cross section of interested parties including uh state government uh agricultural groups um development industries and uh and from the development industry as well uh summary of the submissions uh tabled uh in the attachment one uh to the report um but uh following a consideration of uh the matters that raised uh the officers considered that only minor points of clarification were needed to the proposed policy with some advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately council the no major changes proposed and the um policy is now presented uh for your consideration and adoption at the next meeting thanks michael uh questions or comments council mcphee michael please um did i did we respond to all the submitters michael with our response uh generally counsellor no we don 't uh respond until the council is resolved on what it wants to adopt so that we know uh we can report back to those who means exactly how their um submissions being dealt with okay so they haven 't had the opportunity to respond to any of these reasons that we can see in the report their opportunity to comment about the proposed policy was during the notification period yes okay um so there 's no so i guess what my question is is they 've submitted we 've come up with responses but they 're not they haven 't been notified of what 's going what the outcome is yet from their submissions yeah as i said council the statutory process is that after the council adopts uh or makes the decision that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would write back to the submitters and tell them uh how their submission has been addressed and that 's probably because you know it is up to while there 's a recommendation here the council may choose to do something different and it 'd be premature for us to report back to say that we decided something when in fact that decision hadn 't been made okay thank you for clarifying that uh any other questions council barnes okay thank you michael uh we 're going to do the late report now in the planning application yes if you cannot councillor 's principal planner sarah watts is going to present that report for you welcome sarah oh sorry let 's get the two councillors back thanks narelle good morning councillors uh item k4 relates with a development application for a material change of use for a mixed use development being the burnett heads marina village located at uh 67 harbour espionage than it heads the application is subject to impact assessment and has been lodged over three lots that are owned by gladstone ports corporation currently the submitted application seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already approved boat harbour with the retail office yacht club cafe recreation short and long-term accommodation uses in a marina setting these are these activities are proposed to occur within an attractive architecturally designed buildings that range in height from single story to five stories [Music] the proposal can be broken down into three key elements the first being the creation of a commercial center located adjacent to the existing public parking area both ramp and jetty it comprises a compact grouping of single and single two and three-story buildings all sited along the water 's edge the second key element is three apartment buildings which are distributed along the waterfront to the east of the commercial center these are four and five story residential buildings which will be available for both short-term and permanent occupation the last notable feature is a foreshore promenade footpath which stands for the full harbour frontage of the development site public pathways connect harbour esplanade to the promenade and as you would be aware council has recently constructed a footpath along harbour esplanade all specific details relating to unit numbers are tabulated within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of stage 2 is currently undergoing assessment this application will be brought to council for consideration in the near future once officers assessment is completed the site area for the development is about 2.4 hectares the site is currently improved with two-story building workshop that was formerly part of the burnet heads marina also on the site are a number of unused accommodation uh donors the bundaberg volunteer marine rescue which and the now abandoned blue water club all existing buildings are proposed to be removed with vmr being relocated in our new facility in the vicinity of the site um part of the site is located within council 's uh flood hazard area being potentially impacted by storm surge uh the subject site is located about 400 metres from the existing burner heads town centre which council would be aware has council has recently undertaken substantial streetscape works as a result of detailed local area planning completed by council previously approved on the site in 2013 is a 318 birth marina and operational works for prescribed title works for the dredging associated with this approved use dredging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before your counsellors you you 'll note a number of relevant matters are discussed in detail with my presentation today just touching on the most important matters the cyto zone community facility zone it should be acknowledged that this zoning is historically been because the site forms part of the greater bundaberg port area and is owned by gladstone port company and presumably because the volunteer marine rescue service locates on the site the subject site was zoned community zone under the superseded burnett shaw planning scheme and this zoning was carried over to the current planning scheme as the detailed local area planning had not been completed prior to the commencement of our current planning scheme in 2015. since the site was originally designated community both gladstone ports corporation and council have under more detailed land use planning related to the site which are considered to provide more contemporary guidance on the intended use of this site gladstone ports corporation within the port of bundaberg land use plan 2009 included the subject site as use boat harbour precinct with an anticipated range of commercial and residential land uses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladstone port strategic planning for the site another relevant document that considers the long-term zoning of the site is council 's burner heads local area plan that was adopted by council in 2017 this plan acknowledged that the site 's current zoning was due to previous zoning within superseded planning schemes however it recommends the site zoning be amended to identify the marina as a key development site with provisions to encourage a well-designed mixed-use development that 's integrated into the wider burnet heads community it 's considered by officers that the planning supports the use of the site as uh submitted within the application within the report before you the proposed uses are assessed in detail against the relevant use codes being the business use code and the multi-unit residential use code within these codes issues such as the role and function of centers relationship of buildings to the streetscape and public realm building mass and composition building features and articulation amenities safety and security site suitability are all considered as detailed within the report the proposal has been deemed to has been determined by officers to comply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll note key matter discussed in the report before you relates to building heights [Music] as discussed earlier the site is located in the community 's facility zone this zoning does not specify maximum building heights given the zoning of the site for community uses is not really reflective of the envisaged long-term use of the land officers consider that uh zoning that is closer aligned with the envisaged higher density mixed use of the land is the high density residential uses zone within this zone a maximum height anticipated in similar coastal areas is five stories as i 've previously discussed uh another relevant uh document to consider is the burnet heads local area plan which also considers building heights um within this document uh the as proposed the five stories is what this document envisages as a appropriate building height for the subject site as councillors you may be aware that the burnet heads local area plan was subject to significant community consultation and the feedback from this consultation was that the burnet heads community were generally supportive of heights within this plan the applicant has submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated that no overshadowing will occur to existing residents along harbour esplanade as a result of the development similar to building height the uh as the is zone located within the community facility zone um no densities are specified within this zone officers have used the high density zone uh as a benchmark as a more appropriate zone and also the gladstone ports corporation precinct outlook and the burnet heads local area plan which all within those documents also anticipate densities densities proposed within the application before you today align with all of these documents a key matter discussed within the report is pedestrian connectivity external to the subject site um within council 's adopted local area plan for burnet heads it is discussed that a key outcome for the subject site is uh the provision of a foreshaw for everyone it is further discussed that development is to provide a promenade for the full length of the waterfront that is accessible to the community it is recommended in the report before you that this path be wider than a standard footpath and should be something that defines the burnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum total width of 10 meters should be provided we 're abutting the residential buildings and 5 metres elsewhere with a minimum path concrete width of 3 and a half meters and wider nodes provided strategically along the promenade to provide for community interaction officers are recommending that a right-of-way easement be placed over the promenade allowing public access at all times ownership of this land is to remain with the applicant and maintenance of this path will remain the owner 's responsibility it is also recommended that public right-of-way easements be placed over two strategic footpaths connecting harbour esplanade to the waterfront councillors will note that open space was also a key consideration in the assessment of the application the subject site sits out of the planning scheme 's priority infrastructure area as designated with within the local government infrastructure policy therefore open space for the proposed residents and the additional demand that they will create as a result of the development has not been anticipated within the planning scheme it is therefore considered appropriate that it be conditioned that the area of land to the western side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramp and the northern portion of lot 1 be dedicated to council as park these areas are identified on the attachment titled open space before you it is considered that this will benefit not only the residents of the development but the broader burnet heads community development impacts on nesting sea turtles has been assessed within the report as the subject site is located in proximity to monrepo the subject site faces north towards bernard head 's boat harbour and the burnett river and beyond in the vicinity of the development turtle nesting beaches include oaks beach baroba island and monroe pose beach the planning scheme requires applicants consider and and consider this and featured within the planning schemes most recent amendments which introduced a sea turtle sensitive area overlay code to demonstrate compliance with this code the applicant engaged pendoli environmental to prepare a marine turtle management plan that was submitted in response to council 's information requests this information this plan was prepared both for the subject application and the forthcoming application uh within the applicant 's submitted marine turtle management plan uh it is re recommended a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uh turtle lighting counsellors you 'll find these conditions are all listed within the report but i won 't go through them in detail with it is considered that the proposed conditions imposed the uh proposed development will meet the purpose and overall outcomes of the sea turtle overlay code and comply with all acceptable outcomes of the code other than acceptable outcome a05 which relates to the screening of development located on land visible to the beach uh it would not be possible for landscaping to screen the development to oaks beach and monroe pose beach to the south given that some of the buildings are five stories in height however the proposal um includes dense streetscape planting of large trees as well as landscaping at on all upgrade car parks in front of the buildings that will screen the buildings to the south it will also be conditioned that the applicant plant a landscape bluffer in the area condition to be dedicated to councillors park to screen beruba island from the development landscaping is also proposed and conditioned to be provided within the promenade footpath corridor along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions will fulfill the purpose of overall outcomes of the code and the landscaping both within the site along harbor esplanade and the area to be dedicated to councillors park will achieve compliance with the sea turtle sensitive area overlake hope councillors as you will have seen in the report infrastructure provision is discussed in detail a notable outcome of the development is that the applicant will be required to upgrade harbor esplanade to a higher standard than it currently is and the applicant will also be required to construct a bus stopping bay within the road reserve that will service the broader community as i 've previously alluded to the site is identified on council 's flood mapping as being potentially impacted by storm surge in the future when factoring in climate change within the assessment material the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed finish floor levels of the development is above the storm surge and defined flood events the development includes protection for underground car parking with pump out arrangements to be incorporated in the building design uh if stormwater is to get into the basements as i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact assessment and public notification public notification was undertaken from the 23rd of march until the 15th of april this year council received a total of 40 properly made submissions and three not properly made submissions of these submissions 32 were opposed to the development 19 of these 32 submissions were pro former style and 8 submissions were in support of the development key issues raised in these submissions included lighting impacts and potential light spill for marine turtles building heights storm tide inundation impacts on local wildlife and the environment character visual amenity and building design traffic noise impacts impacts on existing businesses in burnet heads sewer density and sustainability all of these matters have been considered by officers in the report before you it should also be noted that queensland treasury was a referral agency for the application for works within a coastal management district they assess the application against their assessment criteria and approve the development subject conditions by letter date of 4th of november this year for this referral trigger which is included as an attachment in the report before you counselors you 'll see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application against all of these assessment benchmark it is considered that the proposal complies or can be conditioned to comply with all of the benchmarks and it is recommended by officers that the development be approved subject to conditions on page 32 of the report you can find the full list of reasons for this decision and recommendation thanks sarah very comprehensive questions and comments councilman thank you very much for that very comprehensive report um just in regards to the conditions i noted that the applicant had a few comments on a number of the items has the applicant have has there been discussions with the applicant in regards to their concerns or uh counsellor i can report that i did speak with the lead consultant but generally the draft conditions process isn 't a back and forwards process it 's a process to give the applicant one look uh at those conditions uh and to then uh respond with any comments they may wish to make i know they can also stop the clock to allow for other further negotiations to occur but um the applicant 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah the report includes those matters uh yeah where we 're not in agreement um but uh officers are confident that the conditions are appropriate in the in the circumstances okay also i noted the number of submissions made was that for the whole development including stage two or specifically to stage one uh this the noted submissions within this report are just for stage one no further questions other counsellors i 've just got one question steve council barnes yep um given the fact that they 're looking at expanding the marina births within the boat harbour area has there been any subsurface geotech studies done on the um on the sediment within there because my understanding historically has been that depending where they expand that there could be the need to use explosives to to shift rock i don 't know whether it 's ever been to that extent or not michael uh council barnes this application doesn 't deal with uh dredging in the boat harbor area that 's the subject of a separate approval and i note that the state have issued environmental licences for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit the applicant would need to go back through the process uh to seek approval for those okay thanks michael uh any other questions no very good thanks sarah thanks michael hello everyone so we now move on to uh some leases and a sole supplier arrangement christine councillors the next four reports relate to renewal of leases at the airport uh the first one is for a site lease cn um so presently it 's uh tenanted and the lease expired on the 30th of september 2020. the tenant wishes to renew their lease commencing on the first of october 2020 for a term of five years with a five-year further option uh rent is at market value um and will be increased annually by three percent and all other lease terms will be on council 's standard lease and it 's proposed that given that the tenant is an existing tenant of lease of land that the exception 2361c3 under the local government regulation is applied to that lease disposal thanks christine any comments or questions the next one o2 is for lease site ae that lease expired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to renew their lease starting from the first decept sorry first of december 2020 again for a five-year term with a five-year option and market rent with the standard three percent increases and all other terms being on council standard lease and applying that same exception under the local government regulation given that it 's a renewal of uh lease to an existing tenant thank you questions or comments council mcphee just a general comment in relation to the to these christine um when the leases are currently operating under whole holding over provisions um do all of the normal like is council 's liability covered i guess is all of the normal lease still in yes that 's right so it continues then on a month-to-month tenancy and it rolls on that month-to-month tenancy until either council was to terminate or the current tenant was to terminate or the lease is renewed next one is lee cb um again that lease expired on the 30th of september and the tenant 's proposing to enter into a new lease starting from the 1st of october

2019 again for a term of five years with a further five-year option again the leases for market rent with the annual three percent increases to the rent and um applying the same uh exception in the local government regulation given that it 's a renewal of a lease to an existing tenant thank you christine questions comments nope get counselor mitchell back thank you next one report 0 5 is in regard to a lease for part of the bagara admin building which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ordinary meeting council made a resolution to dispose of this property to lexi tech there was a condition to that resolution that was made that the lexi tech was required to receive an arbn from asic however there have been significant delays in obtaining that arbn and a director of lexi tech has uh expressed the desire that given the significant delays the lease be changed to rather than being to a lease to taxi lexi tech to a trust being milbank investment trust all the terms of the lease will be um as it was in the august report and it 's proposed that council rescind the resolution made in august and then apply the exception to dispose of the land to the mill bank investment trusts rather than lexi tech thanks christine any questions nope thank you uh okay have you gone to the rdf excuse me mr ceo i 'd just like to remind everyone that i had a declarable conflict on this item okay counselors uh you might be aware of the fact that arts queensland went through a restructure process about two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and that process effectively created what they call a regional arts services network divided up into regions throughout queensland we sit in the cq regional art services network and that funding effectively went towards an officer two days a week who would assist each one of the lgas and there 's six lgas in the central queensland regional arts services network um to assist them to develop arts projects um and also to i guess as a bit of a conduit into arts queensland where there might be other funding available given the fact that as a result of covert there hasn 't been great deal of arts projects happening during this period um one of the proposals discussed by the network who actually sit underneath the web rock um is to engage the officer full time for the rest of the financial year in order to i guess reinvigorate the arts network in art services and arts projects given the fact that covetous restrictions are easing and get more activity in that particular area so in order to do that um we 'd have to um increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund that officer they 've divided it up between the councils our share effectively becomes thirty two thousand five hundred forty dollars but we applied to the state government under our radf program which is the jointly funded program that we deliver locally where fifty council puts fifty percent towards radf the state matches that um and so we 've got approval from the state effectively to to share that 32 000 so they will effectively utilize part of their radf their 50 funding and council only has to put in 16 270 towards the offices so um the this report is really just to engage that regional art services network on a sole supplier arrangement because we are paying for the service but the net cost of council will be 16 270 which will come out of our existing radar funding haven 't taken any questions or comments nope thank you nothing else uh thanks that brings to a conclusion the open part of the meeting and then we 've got four items to discuss in confidential you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",4565,appreciate meeting for the july council meeting uh in keeping with uh previous practice we will just go around the table and have everyone declare um mr ceo in regard my son who works for council has been doing a report on that and zayn appears in that report and i wish to declare a received conflict regarding his professional advice thank you council trevor yes d1 d1 the renewal yeah through you as the ceo i think uh uh yeah it 's it 's in that thing yeah yeah yeah d1 isn 't just about the acting ceo right now sorry trevor in relation to madison.com thank you um the first item today is on d1 appointment of acting ceos this is a standard arrangement that 's been in place for many years so that when i am absolutely hoping one day again on anguli we rotate the accuracy arrangements across the three gm 's so that just saves us having to come back to council each time and that arrangements stay in place for the uh to determine this council any questions the next one 's a financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week if we 're provided the uh i suppose the initial draft um result or position at the 30th of june and for council obviously this is still subject to audit and also a number of other minor adjustments which which we 're still processing um it is really hot and that 's why we relate addition to the agenda just going through some of the information in the report overall the operating position is um what we were classified as a very good result in that we 're about a one percent or less than one percent variance from the budget uh our target up until this year was 10 plus or minus and so that sort of indicates where we 've landed uh and our target goes forward will be five percent so it is a really good result uh however uh i suppose with kobe and there 's a few things which have happened to bring us into the position that we 're in and we 're expected to be probably in a worse position against the budget and we will provide more detail of that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial statements and we 'll bring that more detailed information and analysis back to council at that point in time just going through it on the revenue side the water from rates water consumption was up and that was mainly due to the dry conditions earlier in the year in the fees and charges um a couple of things happened in uh in june which were sort of unexpected there 's the waste fees at the landfill sites was up about 400 000 more than we expected uh and we believe uh most of that is from the dumping of um contaminated soil from the new aldi site uh so it 's about four hundred thousand over four hundred thousand dollars there um which makes the figures look good and the um um i think there 's a another thing we have there that came up obviously the um there 's some water um higher um type works in water this year as well on the entrance front where it is found most of it is relating to either they 're not charging or not charging of interest on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving investments at our all-time low with the grants in subsidies a bit of a surprise there our financial assistance grant was about seven hundred thousand dollars more than um what we expected last year so we get paid um a half year advance of our financial assistance grants early each year so so the 2021 grant has already been paid to us or half of it has been paid for us and that was up about seven hundred thousand dollars um at this point in time we don 't have detail as to why it 's up seven hundred thousand and maybe that we 've got a further advance it may be that our slice of the pie is bigger so we 're not sure at this stage where that 's a genuine increase in revenue or it 's just a another advance but that certainly helps our bottom line 30th of june and the other one is the number of land sales that was processed uh in the year uh as now we generally don 't budget for any land sales uh unless they 're just about guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole in the budget and it 's about 1.5 million sales have gone through um so which really i suppose offsets the decrease in fees and charges that we saw during the year on the expenditure side um the employee costs as you 'll see in the report is significantly higher than the budget this has come about mainly due to kobe 19 that the staff have deferred their leave taking a bleed so what the council does in that budget it estimates the number of weeks that a typical employee will work and that 's around about 41 to 42 weeks a year if someone has and that 's how we cost the budget on if someone doesn 't take four weeks of annual leave that means they 've been worked 46 weeks a week when that extra four weeks gets costed to the operating section if they take their leave it comes out of a liability and doesn 't appear on the operating side so basically our liability is increased and our um our expenses has also increased this year uh the opposite will happen when in when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their leave again in the future periods that will offset it so we 've won the expense this year um to the offset by next year something else which has happened is that with the um leave uh long-term sleep provisions the the calculation there has increased significantly again this year um the reason for that is the lower discount period so basically what we do is we look at the amount of um revenue or amount amount of funds we need to fund the long service leave over a long period of time so like 10 years and then we apply the discount to discount that back to our present value if the discount rate or interest rate and that was saying um decreases that means we need more money now to fund that we 're not going to be generating as much interest in future periods um so that 's also resulted in a fairly significant increase and we don 't expect that to change uh but there will be no upsetting in future periods so i believe the interest rate will stay at the current rates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services there 's a number of reasons why materials services are down and where our waste labor fee was slightly under this year the number of non-capital projects in the sewage fund will be deferred until next year so that that cost will still be coming we 've got the new accounting standards and the way we must manage leases so it 's quite technical but um basically what 's happening is our lease payments will decrease and hospital and then just get transferred to depreciation because we 've got to depreciate but we identify an asset and then appreciate it during the period so it 's really i suppose a movement between the lines so you 'll see the materials and services have gone down but the depreciation has actually gone up in the figures and so it 's just the new accounting standards with the depreciation also we 've reviewed the plant useful lives this year and which which have been reduced slightly and that 's also increasing the amount of depreciation on the plant from a cash point of view and we 're in a a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 24 million more than what we had estimated in the budget um and the large portion of that all relates to uncompleted capital work so our capital voices down about 19 million um that was unspent but also in the couple work expenditure that was showing this there 's commitments in there so we 've either prepaid some of the water and wastewater projects so all happens it gets close to that 24 million variants so there 'll be some other minor adjustments in our non-current assets on the uh capitol as i 've just sort of mentioned uh just looking at the graph there the um it 's about uh as i said 19 million unspent the plant uh commitments um so so with the plant although they 're showing that um there are only about 60 percent spent uh it 's actually we 've committed a lot of costs there the goods haven 't been received yet so that therefore they might show in those actual figures um and then with the buildings uh the main ones there would be the community hub and construction out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then some scattering of other projects that weren 't completed at the end of the year each year from the raids point of view which is as far as not as significant as in the percentage you can 't spend but a dollars significance and most of that relates to uh bridge renewals uh also there was uh 3.3 million dollars in the jinjin streetscape which was understandable june 1.2 million in burnt heads and then once again there 's a number of other small projects across the region we 'll provide more information on that as part of the um carryover budget that we 'll be bringing back to council for the next next meeting on the rank status side so this is the gross rates outstanding so the gross rates have increased by about 800 000 which is i suppose expected and that may increase this year given that we don 't have a discount period and also not charging interest up to the end of december so we will be active in following up with the ratepayers that haven 't paid during the uh or after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side which is really interesting is the pre-payments have actually increased by over a million dollars so we 've gone from just over seven million to eight million dollars in pre-payments um and that equates to about ten percent of our rates um is now being prepaid before the at the thirty for june so that 'll actually increase before we issue the rate notices um which is a really good story and considering the circumstance any questions is a new proposed policy to be adopted by council the policy relates to the vandenberg regional aviation aerospace precinct or the brap that we shorten it to so obviously the airport is a key piece of uh strategic transport infrastructure in the region and for that reason and council being an airport operator as a safety mechanism is proposing to adopt a policy position that council uh not disposed by way of classes of land that um have potential access to the um airside land and that those parcels are only disposed of by way of lease the policy is with your papers and it 's presented to council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item is g2 which is about the delegations register review so in accordance with section 257 of the local government act council is required to review its delegations register at least annually council receives from the local government association of queensland a delegation register service and council officers pursue that delegation 's register and the proposals which are provided to council and assess whether they 're suitable for council for adoption inclusion in our delegations register we generally look at that when we receive the two summaries through which happen in queensland parliamentary recess over summer and winter the new registers that are proposed to be added to the delegation 's register are the residential tenancies and grooming accommodation covert 19 emergency response regulation the state penalties and enforcement regulation transport infrastructure state control roads regulation and water fluoridation regulation 2020 and there are some other amendments to the register for delegations that are already previously been adopted which include amendments to wording or new powers added to those existing registers the register with the proposed amendments were attached to the report and there will be presented any questions can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes and also i 'm just wondering whether it 's permanent to defer this i know it 's from the reports of urgency but i 've tried to go through some of these and there 's a lot there when you try and look at the legislation as it stands at the moment for the changes i just like the opportunity for all councils to workshop and go through the items and that it 's um it 's all you know we get these delegations come through which is always good but we don 't actually understand why the changes have been recommended so i think it 'd probably be good governance to actually sit down and work through them so that we 've got a thorough understanding of what they 're all about uh well i 'd like to respond to that before i thought that was the process we went through on consultation day a week ago because there 's nothing in here that possibly proceeded a consultation day which was an opportunity to go through it in exactly the same detail you just respond to your counselor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're live streaming if i can have your indulgence through you mr chair he 's uh just for people who are live-streaming the understanding of a briefing meeting is is nearly a week before a general meeting to allow the elected members councillors to to questions the brief that are actually before us in this particular instance um the matters brought up by the council there in relation to good governance and so forth this these matters have not changed for many many years the actual uh consultation days involve a a rigorous uh look at the policies that the procedures and the delegations and also the what 's i take on board the actual particular advice from lgaq but that is done uh as per normal of every other council in queensland and has been done over i 'm sure the whole length of term of the the councillor 's time in as an elected member of council so there is uh has been no change from an lgaq perspective the legal perspectives uh through king and co or other legal representations is a part of looking uh at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at on average from the state of queensland so the state has legislative changes that comes through the amounts of delegations have not changed significantly over the years so the process is the state legislation any amendments from the state legislation then obviously then this is then sorted through by lgaq to see the relevance into local councils it is then sent to advice from king and co and other crown law equivalent advice to get legal advice and then when stan is then sent out to council as per previous occasions our staff spent uh christine up uh on 100 hours 200 excess of 200 hours in excess of 200 hours then going through the relevance of that legislation how it impacts bundaberg council because through you mr chair is there 's matters in that legislation that would be relevant to councils in western queensland other north queensland or other areas that is not completely not relevant to bundaberg regional council possibly any other council across the the demographic so um there is it is you know that 's by way of more of a statement in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us here so i 'm aware of obviously maybe other meetings or reasons why attention is being brought to this today however i think that the process of filtering the information through so many different very credible processes when it comes to here today certainly has a a great uh degree of maturity in relation to how it is vetted before delegations have ever come out and um and then also when we get here to a local level the actual delegation modes before it comes to this particular uh meeting here today there is the council over time has said that needs to identify what the particular changes are so that we can address particular changes which we do within those consultation meetings prior to here today but i know that uh we certainly need to to always continuously look at improving the standards and raising the bar because we want to be a council where part of even our corporate plan is a place of choice for for people to have and work under as well as the community as well so yeah do you hear mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catholics just about it 's not i 'm happy with that um as long as all of these have been um sent us by the lgaq um you know as they do across the state as you say so yeah i 'm happy to do a lot on that basis it 's through you mr chair he 's he 's just if it was i 've seen your guidance but i 've been more than happy to reiterate or get the advice from lgaq uh yeah i 'm happy to distribute that my understanding of speed was the lgaq uh that 's right the attachment that 's in uh the report is actually lgaq 's suggestions and then you 'll see it 's marked up so council officers have been through and marked up and proposed which ones are not deliberate powers and uh which ones council is proposing to include in our register so we 'll we 'll distribute that today and councils can view that prior to the leading next week any other questions okay uh you know the next one too so the next item g3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year council makes an application to the office of the industrial relations nominating show holidays for our region under the holidays act in previous years councils proposed two show holidays the jinjin show holiday being allocated the monday before people 's day of the brisbane exemption in august each year and the rest of the region observing the show holiday on the last thursday in may it 's proposed that uh the uh same process happened for this uh next year so for 2021 so postcodes with four six six zero and four six seven zero will observe the show holiday on the thursday 27th of may 2021 and for four six seven one the show holiday be monday the 9th of august 2021 uh council offices in the whole of the region including jin shin will observe the show holiday on thursday 27th of may 2021 so that 's for all uh local government employees there 's any questions about that um does that mean that the officers and children 's like the public offices and facilities they 're all closed when bundaberg has its show holiday that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um all council staff observe it on the exact same day yes has there ever been um did are the staff find i 'm just wondering about the local people that live in jinjin and work for council as well not being able to maybe visit the show on their actual dedicated show holiday has that ever been anything that 's been raised as an issue i think the jinjin shows usually on a saturday and sundays and counselors yeah yeah always so uh wouldn 't be a problem no yeah cool thank you thanks christine so the next item is g4 which is about the audit and risk committee minutes so uh the audit and risk committee uh met on the 22nd of january 2020 and the minutes of that meeting have recently been endorsed by the new audit and risk committee the minutes are provided to council for noting and the committee chair stephen coats will present to councillors in october to provide council with a verbal update on matters being considered by the committee during 2020 and the committee 's recommendations about those matters is any questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the fourth quarter operational plan review so in accordance with section 174 of the local government regulation the chief executive officer is required to present a written assessment to council in accordance with our progress towards implementing the annual operation plan this gives a guide as to how councils are progressing towards meeting the goals of the corporate plan the report is presented to councillors for noting and there 's indicators throughout the report and the managers for the kpis have provided their comments where applicable you 'll note there are um a few departments that have obviously been affected by crowbar 19 and you know event shutting and things through the moncrief and the airport they 're noted there for council and but most areas are achieving their set targets if there 's any other questions on that report thank you uh okay [Music] each year under the biosecurity act our officers undertake surveillance for pest plants and pest animals so the nature of both of those things is they 're not limited to properties that tend to spread and so under the biosecurity act one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undertake a surveillance program so we have a particular area where we 're getting reports of wild pigs while dogs or a flush of weeds of significance we need to go in and check out those particular areas to find it if when they 're present then two uh if notices are required uh council officers need to get access to the property so the requirements of the biosecurity act is that if we 're looking to do a surveillance program of a particular area we need to publicly advertise that and put in a resolution to effectively each huge financial year um to undertake surveillance programs so each year what we do is represent surely after the start of each financial does this report to councillors that allows officers to effectively own takes advance across the entire region if we do get issues of pest plant or animal on particular properties so happy to take any questions if there are councillors um council might be aware of the fact that for the last three years we 've hosted the bulls masters event usually around february march each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cricketers and sports people who come to town um they spend a couple of days here they usually work with local schools and running coaching programs i 'm also with bundaberg cricket and local qriket organizations i 've been helping a lot of cricketers trying to build a profile of cricket they usually then finish with a t20 game where celebrities can play a local team and then they 've had a garlic ball at the end with the intention of one increasing the profile of that particular sport and getting kids back into sport and additionally raising money for local crickets so over the last three years they 've effectively fundraised over 110 000 which they 've donated back to bundaberg cricket to improve facilities and obviously encourage young kids back in so that 's three year period finished start this year the last event was um down to february and so they 've offered it to us again for another three years we had a crowd about 3 000 at the t20 game this year so it 's quite popular with the locals and as i said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that um bull 's masters approached just before the election and asked if we 're interested in hosting um the youth cup which is an event involving under 16 teams from throughout queensland they effectively arrive at the venue and spend a week here undertaking a round-robin competition um each team is allocated a former cricketer or either a queensland quaker or australian cricketer they live stream the event so it gets quite a high profile from a sporting perspective because of coded usually they would have those things locked in a lot earlier but i guess the uncertainty about actually running sporting events and particularly things where we 're going to attract crowds it 's been an issue so they had spoken to us some earlier indications at the time was we would have to wait obviously until a new council was formed and that 's been further delayed by the uncertainty regarding the current covenant restrictions but they 've come back to said listen i 'd like to offer it to bundy to host it happens in the first week of december um as i said i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 16s they tend to bring family with them um and because it 's the start of the school holidays they tend to overstay then so they 'll get here early i 'll then have the event if it stayed late and that 's what 's happened where it 's previously been hosting makai and so provide quite a stimulus while they 're here for that week and so this report is recommending that we move into a further three-year agreement for the bundaberg masters bulls masters event which is the one that 's usually in february um at a cost of twenty thousand dollars per year plus five thousand income that incline usually includes um providing waste facilities for the events and also uses of multiplex with the ball and then uh one off holding the youth cup in december this year at a cost of 60 thousand dollars so i 'm happy to take any questions if they 're hurting thanksgiving um you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"
AUS,QLD,Bundaberg Regional Council,Bundaberg Regional Council,https://www.youtube.com/user/BundabergRC,Bundaberg Regional Council - Briefing Meeting - 16 October 2020,QfoVr9DoU1g,20201015,1381.919,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",2371,good morning everybody welcome to the council briefing meeting first items of public notice of meetings for uh 2021 um clearly while we 're still in a covered environment there 's still some uncertainty about when we 'll be able to reopen meetings to the public and and also when we may be able to have meetings outside of this venue as we normally do twice a year when we go to jinjin and childress so the meeting schedule for next year is is needs to be set by council under the act but obviously if you look at the recommendations there 's some flexibility in there depending on when we find out what happens with covert by the end of the year so that 's why it 's worded that way with a little bit of uncertainty in point three any questions no thank you and the next item is the financial management report for the 2020 audit and simon will be presenting foreign this report is the closing report associated with the financial audit which is provided as part of the annual report later on in the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this report one item is an improvement opportunity associated with a compliance register and the other is a technical accounting issue around the implementation of new accounting standards both of which council or management i should say is looking to resolve in the next financial year were there any questions around the continent of that paper no thanks simon are you going to do the financial summary as well yep just a financial update as at the first of october not much has changed from the last report to council um most of the uh recurrent income is tracking on budget the exception is the interest revenue is identified uh previously um we 'll monitor that uh in the next i suppose three months it 's likely the earnings there will be less than what council 's adopted in terms of the recurrent revenue much the same most of it is on track at this stage there are some uh known potential variations in the later half of the financial year and we 'll bring those back to council at the half year budget review as appropriate uh capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital program which is in line with our expected cash outlays most of the expenses so far has been around the roads drainage and platinum equipment asset categories cash cash at the first of october was 163.5 million as you can see from our analysis that 's where we 're expecting it to peak um this financial year so it 'll decrease between now the next rate levy in january february the no foreseeable issues around cash management rates outstanding at the first of october were 13.3 million um as we all know that 's a little more than uh what has previously been the case um we 're still receiving prepayments um over this period and many of the ratepayers have chosen not to pay the rates have entered into arrangements with council in terms of other debtors there has been an increase in the cash receivable balance during the month and that was around several infrastructure charges notices now ticking over 60 days past due we 're just recovering those via internal resources at this stage there were no debts above the delegation limit of two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loan balances after the debt payment uh in september is shown there below and that 's currently 75.7 million were there any questions on the financial summary thanks simon thank you uh the next item is the audit risk management committee minutes christine councillors um item g1 is in regard to the audit and risk management committee meeting minutes so the committee met on the 3rd of september and the minutes are attached to your report for adoption yes so the next item is g2 which is in relation to the annual port for 2019 2020 so the local government act and local government regulation require council to prepare an annual report each financial year the annual report is to be adopted within one month after the day the audit general 's report is given to council the order of generals report was received on the 9th of october with an unmodified audit opinion and attached to the report is the annual report for councils adoption so in accordance with section 174 of the local government regulation the chief executive officer must present a written assessment to council of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews of normal intervals of not more than three months the report is provided with the report there and each manager 's provided comments to each of them you 'll notice from the report that 's been provided a number of uh areas are still affected by covert so the menus of managers have noted that beside those kpis the other part to note is the plumbing and compliance kpi is no longer required as council adopted in june to no longer have fast track applications which is why that 's there as well so the operational plan for quarter one um is to be received and noted as a council 's office 's recommendations uh back to the community and also noting those kpis where there is uh orange dots uh you know the effects of covert uh certainly have impacted not just on the attendance numbers but uh also on the uh the finances of the council which is thanks mr may um all right nothing else on the operational plan we 'll move on to the council policy review thanks christine uh this uh report to council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some policies so the first policy that is being presented is the changes to the council of code of conduct and standing orders this is a result of changes to the local government act and local government regulation recently which is all part of a rolling reform that the queensland government 's been commencing since uh 2018 the revised policies that are presented to councillor in accordance with best practice and they also are aligned with the recommended policies that are provided from the department of local government in addition there 's a new complaints management policy so council officers identified that a number of separate complaints policies that we had for different items such as administrative action complaints and public interest disclosures all had similar themes through them so what council has done is uh rolled those into uh overarching complaints policy with the separate procedures which will follow behind them so that 's for council 's adoption and we 've also implemented a new delegations policy and contact with lobbyist policy so at the moment council has the required registers in accordance with the act and the integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're identified as good governance for council to adopt both of those and amendments have been made to the gifts and benefits policy the amendments in section 2.1 which is relating to employees not accepting in-store or online competitions where the products have been purchased and the entry into those competitions have been from purchase of goods through council funds thanks christine a lot of work in making sure that our policies meet the changes to the legislation and with the rate of change we 've had in the legislation and regulations in the last few months it 's a credit to the staff that they 've been i 'll keep up to date on that and get the revised policies through to council as soon as possible any questions comments no thank you uh and we 'll move on to the sale of lot 25 and councillor trevor 's uh giving me a declarable conflict of interest in relation to that matter thank you so councillors this report is in relation to the sale of lot 25 on sp 210113 um councils received an offer uh through first national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property this property has been previously offered for uh for sale through auction which was not successful and the property was passed in um council this reports uh presented to you so that the exemption to the auction and tender requirement contained in section 236181 is applied to this report given that the property has already been previously offered through auction or tender the disposal of the property is for market value and the recommendation is that the exception contained in that previously mentioned section is applied to this sale and that the chief executive officer be authorised to enter into a contract with the buyer and attend to all items required to finalize the sale of the property thanks christine i might just highlight that we commissioned her and todd white to get a new valuation for that property or more recent valuation prior to accepting that offer questions comments all right thank you that 's it for i 'll do this one as well governance oh this is the lease oh you 're gonna do the lease we 'll get council travel back oh yeah that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the commonwealth of australia which is represented by geoscience australia which is for a part of the land at the airport precinct so on the crook side of the airport at the moment there 's already a pillar and a gps hut which is where geoscience have their equipment on council 's land geoscience have requested that they formalise their arrangement with council by entry into a lease for the pillar site and a license over part of the gps hut the gps hut is used by both council and other tenants the proposed lease will be for a term of 10 years and it 's on a peppercorn rent basis and council offices are proposing to apply the exception contained in section 2361b1 of the local government regulation given that the disposal of this lease area is to a government agency thanks christine questions council mcphee i was just wondering that um other tenants that are in the gps hut can they need well are they going to be able to stay or do they need to leave with this new arrangement no they 'll be staying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that are required does geoscience cover the cost to council in relation to or do we require a survey because it 's a 10-year lease it will be registered on title so a formal survey plan will need to be prepared and the tenant will be responsible for those costs yes thank you thanks christine any other questions on that one no and who 's doing the rent relief gavin hello with item r02 uh which is an extension of rent relief uh councils be aware that in march this year um as a result of the impacts of cover the decision was made that those operators who operated out of council premises would be provided rent relief for a period of six months uh that rent relief period uh expired on the 30th of september so um we 've had requests written requests from five different operators all located at the airport obviously the airport 's been one of those areas which has significantly been impacted as a result of code and continues to be so so we 've had requests from the cafe operator out there who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company taco local company who undertakes the advertising on site having a look at the requests we 've decided to hold off on the three hire car companies at the moment we 're seeking further information from them on their financials but certainly the two that we 've got uh today um are the carry-on cafe and also taiko so they 've effectively said that um they rely on passenger movements through the airport to drive their revenue um both from an advertising perspective you know they need eyeballs to see these things um and from the cafe 's perspective obviously the more people going through the more likely they are to sell things and we 've been significantly down i 'm at the airport 15 percent of passenger movements compared to the same quarter last year up until the end of september um based on what we 've seen with the airlines uh with um uh one airline uh suspending their services at the moment um being alliance and qantas link um just gradually increasing flights as demand comes on we 're not likely in the foreseeable future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh and as a result of that um this uh report proposes that we extend for a further three months rent relief for both the cafe and the advertising the taco advertising so the financial impacts of that are that at the moment between those two uh we generate two thousand eight hundred and thirteen dollars a month um in rent uh so for the three month period that will equate to eight thousand four hundred and thirty nine dollars happy to take any questions questions thank you very much um councils can i just flag that because we have to have the briefing meeting earlier than usual because of the lgaq conference next week there will be some late items that we 'll be distributing by email to you probably early next week so i apologize they 're coming as late items but it 's important we consider them at the october meeting so we 'll get those through to you as early as possible mr man finish real you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

QLD 4670, Australia",2219,[Music] [Music] [Applause] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning and welcome to Anzac Day 2020 no matter where we are across our magnificent region I sincerely hope that today Anzac Day can provide us with inspiration as we reflect on that first Anzac Day and the subsequent battles around the world where our uniformed men and women have so gallantly served the phrase we live in uncertain times has certainly been widely used by leaders in recent weeks one however can only imagine of the uncertain times in which the world found itself during the first world war in the darkness of the morning of April 25th 1915 Anzac troops were huddled in their long boats as they were rode to shore and preparation for their landing at Gallipoli one can only surmise that the feelings within the boats nervous anticipation a dread of the unknown the uneasiness and the uncertainty today as corvid 19 pandemic rages across the world we 're somewhat like those men in those long boats being rode to shore we are all floating on a sea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mates in their boats we are all in this together these words too have become a catch cry around the world as humanity understands that only through sticking together and observing a necessary discipline will it provide the best outcome for everyone in the long run we all know the legend of the Anzacs and that immortal landing today I want to observe what is now a time-honored tradition regarding the commemoration of Anzac Day while times may change some things need to always hold their traditional values Anzac Day is one such value and tradition and Zak day is our very special day this day is now an entrenched part of the Australian Way of life even though 105 years have passed since the ill-fated landing at Gallipoli Anzac Day remains central to who we are as a people and as a nation the day was born out of civic pride both in Australia and with our closest allies in New Zealand the first n 's act day was commemorated in 1916 a year to the day after the Gallipoli landing despite the calamitous nature of the landing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories of gallantry and the reports of how our country had grown in international stature due to deeds on the battlefield today no original anzacs remain the ranks of returned servicemen and women

apologize for interrupting there and i know i was in full flight but i 'll say it again mr chairman look some two years ago the state made available in excess of half a million dollars to coastal councils across queensland to look at sea level rise erosion and a whole range of other things tropical cyclones that can affect our coastal areas now as we all know we have a number of beach areas across our coastal area that have been affected by erosion and and different things so it was a good opportunity for to prepare some engineering reports to have a look at the likely impacts uh going forward over over the next 50 years or more we also missed the map formed a reference group of people who lived in those parts of that area right across the foreshores to come together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading information out into the community and being able to give advice back to our engineers from those areas that they come from as to the likely impacts from that has come this final report mr mayor and it is a report based on a trigger approach so we will do nothing until something occurs it 's not a time-based approach it 's been out to the public for consultation there has been countless hours over the last two years and i commend our staff for the effort that they put into it i commend the reference group for the voluntary hours that they put into it as representatives of their communities this will give us the opportunity when something happens without having to go back to the state for every little thing we have this report in place it allows us then to go and do what has been designed in the report to make our beaches safe and to keep them in in the pristine condition that many of them are now so i commend a report to the council thank you council trevor any other council wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those i 'll just before moving on i just want to actually just support council trevor 's uh comments in there the reference group did a magnificent job and was one of regard as one of the uh the most well attendance reference groups uh across all of these other chas opportunities on the state and certainly bundaberg was the second council in queensland to get its uh its applica its applications and processes in place so big thank you to the staff uh so i 'll now go to the overall vote always in favour nice against no so moved the next item of

planning scheme policy for the development works for public consultation can i have a secondary please second is councillor trevor uh there 's a number of items in relation to this uh for the positive changes uh particularly with the increase uh that we have across the region in the in the development industry but i 'll just ask the uh ceo if there 's any uh particular items that needs to be addressed from the operational side uh thank you mr mayor i think you 've probably accurately summarised the reasons for this proposed amendment uh it 's in response to a potential surge in development postcode particularly with some of the state and federal government incentive schemes are in place and i think if you look at the statistics that have been coming through in the last few weeks in terms of planning applications uh it 's pretty hard to deny that there isn 't uh a great deal of interest in development at the moment everything from sort of sheds through to large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh provides better guidance for council officers in circumstances where council will accept a security bond to cover the costs of uncompleted development of works and that will enable earlier approval of survey plans and commencement of of usages thank you thank you ceo does any other council wish to raise any queries or speak against the motion all those in favor days against so moved i 'll just get counsellor on a back i think he 's back in relation to this one item k2 is anyone leaving in that one so i just acknowledged councillor cooper is leaving yeah the council is staying and able to vote thank you councillor honour for returning the next item is item k2 uh it 's uh is in relation to uh 41 to 49 tildes road branyan there 's material chains of use for service

for the following reasons as detailed in the attached report and as seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second uh please second there councillor john lairmont before uh calling the ceo on the operational side to speak this matter certainly has had uh extensive consultation from stakeholders and the community is extensive consultation in relation to other state government departments and referral agencies in relation this application i do note that the applicant has altered the design and plan a number of times but all that taken into account uh the council certainly has put forward the uh the refusal of this application i 'll just ask uh council ceo anything else to add to the report thanks mr mayor you 've already highlighted this application has been uh with council now for over two years it has been subject to a lot of discussion uh modification and consultation with the applicant but you 'll also note that there was a large amount of interest from adjoining landowners which is primarily in

2020,mM1bF0tyWpE,20200922,2426.88,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",5121,the september briefing session uh the first item oh sorry we will go around the table and call for um any you haven 't done that already have you no no okay so any conflicts of interest or material personal interest around the table for council of arts um i 'll be declaring a perceived conflict of interest in item t10 council honor uh h1 perceived conflict due to my son making uh the reports on that um also i wish to leave the room on q1 in relation to baldwin swamp due to an independent assessor inquiry uh i was clear to that but i don 't want to participate in that okay council trevor wait a minute i 've got to perceive conflict in relation to tobin shortcut road the archery group i have shot archery with them i 'm not a member of their group and also k1 planning uncompleted works i wish to leave the room on that because i have uncompleted works on a development of mine um and t1 uh perceived conflict due to my son making a report in the early stages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks councillor honor council trevor um i have a perceived conflict of interest for h1 and t10 h1 and t10 uh mr mayor and another one sorry um also a perceived conflict on k2 k2 okay all right sorry we 'll uh now start the meeting so the first item is a petition for noting in relation to the bollard at walker 's point boat ramp um i might just add for councillors information that i 've written to both the department of fisheries and environment and ask them for their thoughts on the request to remove the bollard at this stage i have received one response from fisheries but not yet from des any questions on that one next item is a financial summary welcome anthony welcome back anthony um um working oh come on okay um so so far from a financial point of view about uh 17 of the way through the year and to date some of the things to note is obviously the rates and charges for the first six months have been issued and the due date has since passed with the fees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than what we expected mainly due to the increased activity in the development sector so i suppose with the funding for first-time buyers and new houses and things like that and we 're seeing increased activity there on the recurrent expenditure side the depreciation is in line with the budget at the moment but we will be revising the budget we had a significant increase in our water and sewage assets passive assets last year to the 30th of june and we 're expecting up to about 1.5 million dollars increase in depreciation in those business units across the across those two business units from a cash point of view and we can see that we 're pretty much in line with where we 're expected to be at this point in time and although there 's a slight dip there if you looked at the graph on i think it 's page 10 and and that 's probably reflecting the uh rates that haven 't come in this year and we 're somewhere around about five to six million dollars um short of where we were in previous years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting that that at the date of the report we had about 50.3 million dollars outstanding and at the time the report and there was about 40.6 million dollars in previous years um as at the 21st of the september we have about 11.4 million outstanding uh compared to 2019 it was around about 6 million so that 's just the latest update there not a significant impact on our cash flows at this point in time um and i believe that most of the delay in paying the rates is because we 're not charging interest up until the 31st of january um sorry december so any questions it 's my understanding that a number of people have made arrangements that pay by the 31st of december anyway which equates to quite a significant amount yes and we 've sent out uh reminder notices and encouraging everyone to contact council and get onto payment terms so that their debts are cleared by the end of december as well yes the only comment i 'll make is the it 's the second meeting of the new uh new audit risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's been a lot more questions i think asked uh through this new committee that there was in the previous one happy to move on okay uh next item is the bundaberg region coastal hazard adaptation strategy stewart good morning council i don 't know if i need this this report is the culmination of three years of work to develop a strategy that guides our future decision making around coastal hazards the project was a 500 000 eight stage process it was funded by the state government and the project has involved extensive stakeholder engagement both internally and externally with a project control group a community community reference group a stakeholder stakeholder advisory group as well as oversight from a statewide expert review panel i 'll just bring to the notice of the chair that i will be declaring on the day of perceived conflict in this regard bundaberg regional council is the second local government in the state to reach this milestone with the chas on behalf of the project manager dwayne honor and the technical working group i 'm pleased in fact delighted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond to the public submissions that we receive via the the public consultation period number two is to adopt the bundaberg regional chas and the action plan and release it to the public and the third point is to release the technical reports to the public as supporting information uh thank you mr ceo mr chairman as chair of that community reference group i 'd like to commend everyone that 's been involved in it i think it 's been a process of good consultation with the community members that 's led to a report that has now been made available to the general public for comment i congratulate the state on making the money available because i think it 's important to have these types of reports in place this now leads us to an opportunity to form shoreline erosion management plans underneath this coastal hazard adaption scheme and that points us in the right direction when things happen at different time frames we haven 't got to go back doing ad hoc plans here and there the plan is laid out it 's a trigger-based approach not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same we won 't do anything but if something does happen this plan gives us the authority to go out there and to be able to do the works it needs doing in the particular area that it needs doing so i commend it to the council i also commend the general public and all those that worked on it thank you thanks thanks that 's wonderful on top of the coronavirus cases in victoria now thank you council of barnes information um the next item is the uh two planning items richard are you doing these was that a question or a statement of greg 's so the next first item 's the uh amendment to the planning scheme policy for uncompleted work spot i 'd like to leave the room on this council you don 't have to sing morning morning i won 't sing um a current item is a proposal to amend council 's planning scheme policy for development works and it 's primarily to improve and clarify council 's requirements for bonding particularly bonding uncompleted work so this has been driven uh by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased uh home building uh resulting from the government grants uh that there 's uh likely to be an increase in we have have been seeing an increase in subdivision works and this change would clarify the requirements for developments developers looking to bond uncompleted works which allow early sealing of a survey plan prior to those works being completed so uh the proposal is that the amended planning scheme policy go out to public consultation and then will be brought back to council for adoption after the consultation period thanks evan uh comments or questions thank you yep i 'll just wait till just cancel on rain cancer kick her out you need a doorkeeper morning councillors um item k2 deals with a development application for material change of use on land at 41 to 49 children 's road branding the development application itself is a material change of use for a service station for both uh truck stop and uh regular uh passenger vehicles uh there 's driver facilities associated with the activity um a fuel shop and um selling ancillary goods food and drink sales including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two manual bays 18 car parks 10 b double truck parks and signage associated with the use and the hours of operation from 5 a.m till 10 p.m seven days as related in the uh report councillors have noted there 's a background section that details uh some of the changes that have occurred through through the application and assessment process since it was lodged with council back in july 2018. originally the proposal was lodged over seven lots 3.3 hectares in the area and had land including land fronting paradise lane um council issued an information request in february 2019 particularly raising concerns about some of the sensitive land uses the residential land uses surrounding the site and requested some further information from the applicant in that regard the applicant in response removed the a single lot that was fronting paradise lane and modified some of the service station building locations and the fuel bows and location the proposal that was resubmitted uh is figure 2 in the um in the council of report and this was the application um that went to our public modification in march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a referral agency for department of transport and main roads matters provided a referral response to the application noting children 's road as a state controlled road and approved the access location and considered traffic safety matters subject to conditions in december 2019 council went out to the applicant for further or outstanding matters requesting further details regarding the noise impacts for the development and also asking some questions about the zoning of the land and how the use was compatible with the anticipated development that was intended to occur around the site over time after this request the applicant commissioned a an acoustic report and there was a further modification to the proposal removing the second allotment joining the first that have been removed and again altering the layout of the service station in the shop the accusa report also recommended some acoustic treatments or walls to be um put into place and that represented the third change to the application so that 's the request figure four of the councillor 's report that we 're actually dealing with dealing with today in terms of the site description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being involved in the development now or 2.3 hectares in the area the site 's located on the western side of childress road and it 's bounded to the north and west by emerging communities owned land that 's predominantly being used for residential dwellings on large lots uh the bundaberg airports are located on the opposite side of the road and there 's some industrial land on the opposite side of crook street to the um to the south councillors will note that the detail assessment of the application starts with a review of the planning scheme and particularly the strategic framework around settlement pattern and the emerging communities zone uh bret the brilliant air itself is identified as a major urban expansion area within the planning scheme and it 's uh there 's a commentary that will be focused on accommodating regionally significant levels of growth for the community so as such uh there 's a commentary that 's not to be developed for urban purposes until such time as further investigation the suitability of the land be undertaken and the structured planning is done by the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from land fragmentation and encroachment from establishment of uses that might compromise or make it more difficult to reach that target for a growth area for urban purposes so the interface between land different land uses becomes more important and residential uses and the locality are proposed to be protected from encroachment from incompatible uses applications or development applications are prohibited from being submitted in the zone but in the absence of that local planning the council and the community have a heightened interest in ensuring that development doesn 't make it harder for the growth areas to develop for their intended purpose over time in terms of the emerging community zone uh itself the council will note that there 's within the report that the zone is focused on um establishing effectively integrated and existing communities and interconnected communities so it 's not intended to be used for standalone type developments it 's supposed to be integrated and creating a community for the future residents in that area and of some concern with this particular proposal is that the 7000 square meters of land that 's been excluded fronting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a gap of which there 's no application lodged over and a question about how that land might be used into the future at its highest level the planning scheme strategic planning intent for the brand unidentified growth area can 't be met by this proposal because the local planning hasn 't been undertaken for the site and that 's discussed within the um the report as detailed in the report it 's uh the views of assessing officers that it 's not integrated with the existing community and proposed to serve the bring in major growth area but more broadly serve the passing traffic in and out of bundaberg and that there 's a view that there 's sufficient land in other areas that are better suited to that that purpose councillors will know there 's a discussion about need in the um in the proposal and there 's a discussion in the planning scheme that service stations of this type of scale would regularly locate in industrial zoned areas or commercial zoned areas or rural zoned areas and this site doesn 't meet that criteria it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service station as well as an approved and yet to be constructed service station within 1.2 kilometers of this site in the vicinity of airport drive and twyford street there was no economic assessment demonstrating that there was a need for the development in that regard and so broader thinking might be that um truck traffic after the development of the ring road was to be orientated external to the um the ring road boundaries and that the site might be better located either on the ring road or external to that boundary so that truck transport isn 't coming within the boundary and there 's a commentary within the planning scheme about that as well that talks about service stations of this scale being preferred to be located a minimum 15 kilometers from other service stations of that type and away from existing residential uh planned residential areas amongst other discussions within the report councils i know there 's a heavy focus on the amenity impacts of the development and the council offices through the assessment and actively encouraged the applicant to provide a acoustic report at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage and it wasn 't provided it was only after the outstanding matters correspondence from council that the requested acoustic report was provided and that was a source of some criticism from the community as they reviewed the public notification that there hadn 't been a close regard given to uh acoustic matters and impacts there 's a bit of a summary from the acoustic report that the review the council 's technical expert provided of the submitted acoustic report there was an initial review and then a supplementary review with some refinement but there 's still fundamental challenges with accepting that this proposal can locate in this area as it 's presently proposed and not cause those offside impacts that we 're trying to avoid and there 's a bit of a summary of some of the um the impacts particularly around the trailer mounted refrigeration units on the b double trucks or other trucks in the parking areas and suggested underestimation of noise impacts associated with that aspect of the proposal so the conclusion from the noise expert was that it not only presents an impact to existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potential nuisance risk it also has a effect on the development of that adjoining land if they were to establish for a sensitive land use or a residential land use into the future infrastructure 's discussed and there 's water and sewer connections available to the um site but they 're individual connections dtmr as i said through the referral agency processes has approved the access and the traffic safety aspects of the proposal so there 's no particular issues with access and traffic safety from the referral agency perspective car parking can be dealt with um through conditions of approval estimations of assessing offices and storm water can be dealt with as well uh landscaping would be something that have to be significantly altered noting the acoustic reports suggesting that the four metre high acoustic walls are inadequate yes there 's a public notification section to the report that details um the comments that we received from 58 properly made submissions um 56 sorry probably made submissions back in march 2019 they all objected to to the proposal for varying reasons but a lot of those reasons aligned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning for the area and that the proposal represented a risk or concern to the amenity of that area so that 's detailed in the report for the officers to have a look at taking all those things into consideration uh councillors the planning recommendation is that the proposal will be recommended for refusal and the grounds of those that recommendation provided in the report for your consideration thank you richard uh comments or questions council mcphee i just have a couple of questions thanks richard did the developer participate in a pre-lodgement meeting uh through the chair yes there was a pre-lodgement meeting yes and just one other question when in relation to the referral to the state uh agency they only look at the traffic aspect of the development don 't they they 're not looking at the overall development when they give it a tick it 's just the the access onto that main road that it meets and through through the chair there the primary focus is traffic safety and access and the maneuvering our space impacts to the state road network there are some considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts for certain uses around traffic matters on the state road thank you just for clarification richard i think the question was with main roads the only referral agency there was no other state referral agencies through the chair yes department of transport and main roads with a referral agency other questions comments no thanks richard that 's the cooper back morning councillors um i 've got item 01 here which is regard to a lease of part of tobin shortcut road to the genji and field archers the field archers have been working with council 's property and leasing officer to locate a site which is suitable for them for their club activities the property that council has there is free hold land it is known as tobin shortcut road recreational reserve but it is actually owned that property by council as freehold the proposal is for council to enter into a 10-year lease with the field archers at castle 's standard community rate of 55 inclusive of gst per year and the other remaining terms will be on the standard community lease and it 's proposed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disposal of the land is to a community organization thanks christine uh comments or questions if you could just uh please mr chairman have the yellow area explained on the map the blue area is the reserve as i understand it the yellow area next to it or the orange area there so of the land that 's proposed to be leased to the field arches this is obviously the whole parcel of the land the lease area will be this portion to the field arches that will be under a licence arrangement so that both groups can use that area and this is a proposed lease to the rural fire brigade and will the access to that orange area be for the public as well because the public do um come in there sometimes and use that little facility and the toilet block yeah that area there um that 's in the license area is open to the public right thank you thanks kristen uh no other questions no um next one is also elise christine yes item uh o2 this is for a um proposed lease so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the um changing area for the queensland raw fire brigade so at the moment the fire brigade does already have an existing lease at the site which is due to expire in the next couple of years the lease area you can 't see it on the map but it was this portion of land here and for some reason i 'm not sure on the history but the uh building is actually being built outside of the lease area so it 's proposed to rectify that and they were requiring extra space so it 's proposed to enter into a new 10-year lease for the rural fire brigade on the standard community lease and in this instance we 'll be seeking that council apply the exception in section 236 1b1 given that it 's a disposal of land to a government agency any questions no in their relation mr chairman to the fire brigades tenure there i understood there was a survey in place does that have to be re-surveyed yes the area will be need to be resurveyed because at the moment the buildings outside of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and have the risk transferred you know to the lessee and them responsible for their site their lease area will need to be changed which will require a new survey plan to be prepared other questions nope thank you the next item 's also a lease counselors might recall that when we were doing our site inspection of the botanic gardens this matter was raised uh by wendy driver and this is now to finalise that matter so this is a proposed lease to the bundaberg steam tramway preservation society the lease area is proposed to be slightly altered but when you alter a lease area you can 't actually just do an amendment to the lease it requires a surrender and a new lease to be entered into the site you can see here this presently where the dotted line is presently where the lease area ends so they 're just sort of squaring off uh the lease area um it 's proposed that uh the lease be for a term of 10 years and that council apply the exception in the local government regulation given that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time councils will remember we were talking about the uh railway track that will also be amended at the same time but given that that arrangement 's actually a trustee permit not a trustee lease it won 't require council to apply an exception because there 's actually no disposal under a permit there 's only disposal under a lease term thanks christine any questions on that one no very good thank you next item is the baldwin swamp environmental park management plan amendment um i might just uh point out that council mitchell has proposed an alternate motion for this which after gavin makes his report we might discuss if that 's okay i wish to leave the room on this too mr chairman thank you uh morning councillors uh so as you see i mentioned and the item i 'm dealing with is a modern q1 so which is the ball and swamp at real mall park trust land management plan amendment so the reason it 's amendment is that council had previously in july 2018 adopted uh the baldwin swamp environmental park trust land management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that point in time because the feedback we had from the state was that the land management plan had proposed to include a number of freehold lots and also land which wasn 't part of the environmental reserve and you can only have a trust management plan when the tenure of the land is firstly suitable so freehold land can 't be part of a reserve similarly reserves for other purposes can 't be enrolled into an environmental reserve so as a result of that we 've had to amend the plan and propose to remove the freehold parcels from the land and also those reserves such as park and reserve for park and recreation have also had to be removed because they don 't comply with the environmental reserve components of this land management plan so a fair bit of work has gone into this um effectively what we 're saying is that the recommendation is that the council festival approve the amended plan secondly that we reflect the fact that um those passes of land that aren 't a properly um tendered uh tenured are removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcels including the reserve parcels um and that despite that fact we would still ensure that we uh have ongoing management and maintenance of those freehold parcels that are close to or joining the environmental reserve bearing in mind the fact that some of those don 't necessarily have environmental values we have a caretaker house on one of those for instance and some associated sheds for machinery which we use obviously to maintain the environmental reserve but those puzzles themselves don 't have any environmental value per se so um there 's a slight change to what was put in the recommendation where we removed the about protecting the environmental values of those parcels and just talked about it prove the ongoing management and maintenance of those parcels happy to take any questions if there are any thanks kevin uh councillor mitchell do you want to discuss your proposed amendment or yes thank you my proposed amendment to the recommendation is just for detailing mostly that the parcels that are getting removed so that there 's no historical ambiguity

cancer happened sorry i just realized i did vote on when councilman mcfee voted uh declared that perceived conflict of interest in that same item yes so i just makes councils aware of the sheets that we get from every meeting that 's all right so what i 'll do is i 'll we 'll finish with yours and then go back council uh trevor let 's just raise the point of order yeah it says here on our conflict to your personal interest sheet the membership of a community group supporting club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office holder it 's not a conflict of interest and engagement with a community group a sporting club undertaken in your capacity as a counselor is not a conflict of interest so to my mind that raises the question of whether there is a conflict look uh i think for the matters this morning and simplicity where the councillor has identified uh the uh the possible perceived conflict and we 'll be staying in the room the councils will have that choice in their innovating part whether they uh they they believe there is that there is or there isn 't a conflict so i 'll just finish with uh this one first as it say councillor haven 't been so pursuant to section 175e of the uh of the act the council has been informed of the real or perceived conflict of interest and councillor haberman has not voluntarily left the meeting the other councillors must now decide whether councillor haberman has a real or perceived conflict of interest in the matter can i uh please have a show of hands to those council determined that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council hamilton must leave the meeting and stay away while the matter is being voted on or whether councillor happened may participate in the meeting including voting on the matter can i please have a show of hands today 's council determined that councillor haberman must leave the meeting those uh that who determine councillor hammerman should stay understanding that councillor mcphee will abstain so those that stay yep very good uh the council is determined that uh councillor haven 't been able to stay and vote on the matter i 'll now go back and re-address is that possible through you mr ceo from a government side eventually council haven 't inadvertently voted on counseling please perceive conflict interest yeah we 'll do that because it 's part it 's still fresh and it 's still part of identifying uh conflicts uh at the start of the meeting so if it was separated from that it would be different but as we 're still going through the items in relation to conflict and perceived conflict so the item uh councillor mcphee was in relation to s1 sponsorship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined the reasons why that uh she will be uh remote the council will be remaining in the room uh now i 'll go through the uh the particulars pursuant to the act uh noting that uh councillor hamilton will be sustaining from the debating so pursuant to section 175e of the act council has been informed of a real or perceived conflict of interest and council mcphee has not voluntarily left the meeting the other councillors must decide whether councilman fee has a real or perceived conflict of interest in the matter can i please have a show of hands those councils determine there is a conflict of interest now the councillors must decide whether council mcfee must leave the meeting and stay away will the matter is voted on or whether councillor fee may participate in the meeting including voting on the matter could i please have a show of hands for those councils determine the council mcphee must leave the meeting no okay those the term council uh mcfee should stay uh just noting obviously as we said there before councillor hammerman is sustaining for debate so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay and

real or perceived conflict of interest and councillor haberman has not voluntarily left the meeting the other councils must now decide whether council government has a real or perceived conflict of interest um in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at those councillors who determine uh there is a conflict of interest whether now the council must determine whether councillor hammerman must leave the meeting and

the pursuant to the planning act 2016 and the minister 's guidelines and rules uh council a decide to make a planning scheme policy for agricultural buffers and b approve the proposed planning scheme policy for public consultation and i 'm second to place secondary is our council mitchell uh does so this particular item is in relation to agricultural buffers the agricultural industry is a key contributor to the bundaberg regional economy the state planning policy recognizes the importance of the agriculture area and as well as agricultural land resources to the queensland economy by ensuring the state interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning scheme currently addresses the state interest or a number of mechanisms including the mapping of agricultural land and through requiring vegetation buffers between an existing agricultural use and any encroaching urban development while the requirement for developers to provide agricultural buffers is specified within the current planning scheme it puts the onus on the design on the developer which has resulted in inconsistent standards across the region this has become a source of frustration for the agricultural sector the development industry and council so to address these concerns council development group has engaged this particular brief that is before us now uh with uh consultation of a number of stakeholders and we 'll go out to community uh consultation over the uh the coming month i believe it 's 20 days all up to be able to have stability in relation to the agricultural buffers particularly when issues in the past have involved everything from uh from from dust to smell to noise to lighting to spray-offs and so forth so this will give us some stability to be able to address the the farm rights within uh local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind across all three all different sectors from outward stakeholders from agriculture to development to council as well so looking forward to the community consultation now put that to any other counselors any other counselors wish to raise any queries or speak against the nation no all those in favor those against trevor to come back thanks councilman thank you he

enter into a partnership sponsorship agreement with variety in queensland for the 2020 variety bash adventure to be held in bundaberg in november 2020 with council providing twenty thousand plus gst and sponsorship for the event comes second to plates second that is uh councillor lairmod uh so just uh basically it is uh this particular variety bash adventure we 've seen the success of these uh these variety bashes right across many regional towns uh across queensland uh unfortunately winton is unable to uh host the event this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this variety bash from the figures the economic analysis from where bash has normally started brings in anything from 120 to 180 000 to local economies they have about three thousand star sorry three hundred participants and uh because of covered conditions and so forth it 's an event where they 're limited uh particularly during the event to their particular vehicles and then obviously the other cabin conditions comply like everything else within within our community so there 's a there 's an economic stimulus it 's a good event to bring the community together and because the variety club is the children 's charity is the funding for what they 'll be raising here locally whilst getting out to a number of the other community youth youth community groups within thunderbird region is they 're looking to put the money back into a a large bus for the bundaberg state high school to uh to assist with uh transport for uh for youth to be able to engage in other curriculum outside of that normal school hours that those youth

2020,zG8LuZj1jIA,20200818,1331.919,"Post Office Ln, Bundaberg Central QLD 4670, Australia",1422,um partly due to the fact that the workers on compensation premium injected uk that 's ordinarily all right thanks in terms of capital grants um council has now received approval for its program of projects for works of queensland the drought funding precinct and also recently the local roads and community infrastructure program projects were approved in terms of cash cash balance the person july is 125.5 million that 's greater than our opening forecast due to the effect of uh capital program from last year we 're expecting the cash balance to increase during august with obviously the um receipt of uh rates over that that month and then thereafter will come down as we start to deliver some capital program rates out standing at 31st of july 83.8 million that 's obviously after levy was issued currently the team 's done the analysis of where we are in terms of the rate debt as of uh yesterday compared to the same time last year we 're about 3.3 million behind um so that 's obviously primarily due to the soft debt recovery um process that where councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to consider when that moratorium initiative is lifted in the second half of this financial year and the others won the highlight there were that there were a number of overdue accounts um that was settled during the month of july so the number of accounts there has decreased quite a bit to 62. that 's all in terms of the financial somewhere there 's any questions report here in relation to capital e provisions from last year into this year doesn 't result in any new projects it 's purely a update in terms of the timing delivery of projects so it 's just where projects were not complete last year we 've added them to this year 's budget and adversely if products were ahead of schedule last year we 've reduced the amount required to be spent in this year this doesn 't have an impact on uh council 's current operating budget it does however have an impact on or minor impact on future forecasts that being said we 've still got um positive operating results in the board um nine years um overall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of 106 million and some of the um significant projects um that have been carried forward are listed there um vintage speedscape uh delivery of those fleet items a lot of which have already been received by council during july the other thing i wanted to point out was that the legislation dictates that we 're required to represent the revenue policy but new statement with any budget amendment um those are included in the pack and remain unchanged from that was adopted into june any questions around the couple of projects very good thanks uh this report that 's been presented before the august meeting is about the christmas closure for 2020 so in the past year councils administration centres and depots including the library and the um art centers have closed for the three business days between the christmas and uh new year period so it 's proposed that um the offices close again for that uh period so there 'll be uh three uh business days being from the tuesday the 29th to thursday the 31st of december employees will be offered the alternative taking leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i am going to declare a conflict of interest in that at the meeting i will declare it here this morning because during the talk of the report came railways are mentioned in that report and i 'm a shareholder it was centralized as my wife they do operate cane railways so i will declare that here today i 'll also declare it at the meeting and i will leave the room good morning councils good morning everyone um so the report in front of you today is for the preparation of uh planet skiing policy for agricultural buffers and uh also to proceed to public consultation with that that policy so that policy is uh to provide clearer direction for development industry in regards to development and construction of agricultural buffers urban encroachment adjacent to agricultural land it is more of an evolution to the planning policy rather than something new out of box and provides that sort of clear clearer clarification and fit for purpose the public notification associated with it is for 20 business days and it is our intent to go back to stakeholders who we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again following that engagement we 'll come back to council with a summary of that engagement including any submissions made is there any questions more detail thank you council uh the next one 's the request for funding for dash yes um items one is the ceo mentioned uh there 's a request for sponsorship for the variety bash venture so um the variety of bachelor 's probably well aware of that it 's been a car rally that 's been running for over 30 years by the variety club of queensland they had proposed this year 's original event was going to be in winton actually this month in august but as a result of covert i guess concerns earlier in the year they decided to cancel that event things i guess relaxing a little bit more in queensland they 've tried to remodel it and still have something this year so they put a proposal forward to effectively run a bash adventure which will kick off in november with bundaberg as the starting point traveling to noosa it 's a little bit more exciting than that sounds so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go west and the nature of the variety bash is that every township they stop at they do fundraising and raise money usually and those things are associated with supporting children and their families so they 've approached council to sort of say as the starting point for the bash which will run from the 9th of november through to the 14th of november would council be interested in sponsoring them as the starting line sponsor oh that request is for a figure of twenty thousand dollars which is the same amount that that winton were going to provide for the event that was due to start this month it 's now cancelled um given the fact that we 've had a number of our own events cancelled through code 19 we 've got money in the budget that 's not currently allocated and i guess a couple of other events towards the end of the year are still uncertain at this point in time so we 've got available funds to fund it so the recommendation is that we 've been supported 20 dollars in through a spa publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just an indication of how many competitors i expect 300 um i should have also mentioned the fact that um whilst they 're here they are seeking to raise money uh to buy a 50-seat bus for bundaberg state high school so they 've got their ignite programs most councils might be aware so those youth that are at risk will fall into the normal education system they 've got they pick them up take them to this off-site education facility to try to keep them engaged and give them an education so variety can actually raise money for that bus while they 're here i 'd also suggest to see how there 's been a fair amount of um advertising already which has given a very fairly high prominence to bundaberg as being the starting point and historically for some of those events they 've done um a documentary on them um and then that 's gone on national media they do get affected the media both local and state because of the nature of the fact that they dress up cars and raise money for local charities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us no questions very good thank you okay that 's what we had in the open central event with six items you,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

CEO Thank You mr. mayor good morning everybody we 'll start the title and have on the item number relation to the application I 'm able to just advise the the meeting that I may have a conflict of interest is yet to be determined but the interest of portion of transparency I will be leaving this meeting all that also buys a median tax because I 'm feeling unwell I 'll be sitting at the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay thank you sir I would like to have my morning council to summary to the 29th of May is presenting to show councils progress against the budget just a couple of the highlights of the financial summary as we 're all aware the basic charges will be impacted this year due to interest revenue will also be slightly lower this year than expected because of the reduced interest rates that there are being received at the moment or the thieves and charges in the water section the recoverable works has increased a couple of works late so we 'll see some increase in the Britannian problem in the water area and also have tonight in the revenue it is the south develop land at one point forty million dollars there that we can budgeted for us it 's we typically don 't try to pull this out develop and and unless it 's actually wholly likely that it will proceeding that period of time so on the expenditure side employee costs on its constant depreciation are all on target and we believe they 'll be close to be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be slightly lower and some of that once again is because of where 's that being deferred for that pandemic and also some not a couple of projects and then a good point especially note is the financial assistance grants and we 've budgeted to receive their six monthly payment for next year in this current year which that has to come through and the peppers we stick around about 400 that four hundred thousand dollars more than expected so it 's a good musical counsel and just do at the capital expenditure running around that sixty six percent at the end of May there was a lot of work going on in engineering and we expected getting a lot of places just a bunch of like 30th of June in that space and with on a cash climate hello the it 's higher than expected space watching because of that financial assistance grants but in typically what happens in June asleep we caught the June effect there 's a lot of projects are trying to be completed and before the 30th of June and a lot of accounts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud cash in their in the last last month of the year and with the right state is just an update there and there were about a million dollars worse off than we were at this time last year mainly due to the endemic in counts decision not to actively recover the debt and that works at around about a point four percent of the bank 's FC knee and also on the infringement citizen update on the infringement seven weeks per the the finance team and we sing a new team have been working closely together to go through our recovery processes and how we manage spur we 're getting towards the end of that so we believe we 've got a much better process it 's coming in place too too many are dead although the information is heavily dependent on on spirit cells sniffing and write offs in that spirit I suppose just the night going forward in June there is a a number of variations we expect it will come mainly between the funds they will have a bit of an impact and the accounting standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to apply this year we 're not expecting that to have a significant impact but there will be some change and also it is our crew and they 're hard to predict where the acrylic on the land side but at this stage when you 're not tricking their Lea it 's never gonna change to the budget it 's it 's there but there will be some explanations forward I 'm just wondering if we have because we 're not enforcing the the collection of the rates did we expect that to be larger than the 0.4% we 're behind last year Anthony or is it did we have an expectation I guess five years a difficult one to determine and so we didn 't really have an expectation it 's just something we had to monitor and keep on top of the team have been still in contact with the right types without saying dates just trying character to make public a mat or or periodic hi [Music] for adoption at next week 's meeting we 're presenting the second and last week of the review of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy authors and they will continue to be reviewed and monitored either renewed annually or biannually depending on what 's best practice or if there 's any changes in the law one policy to notice the Moncrief entertainment center community access scan policy that 's going to be rescinded and won 't be amended all re-adopted because of the lack of applications that were received under that scheme so for for new adoption so Alec amendments that were made to those policies we have the alcohol and drug policy version two arts and cultural services fundraising and sponsorship policy version two asset management policy version two burial and private property policy version two cemetery management policy version two commemorative plaques and loriel policies to community grants policy versions who eats a four Underberg region policy version two environmental policy version two exhibits of the policy information to internal audit policy version two record keeping quality version three and water leak relief policy version two and four endorsements and there were no amendments made to these policies we have the community housing rent policy competitive neutrality complaints policy entertainment and hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy related party disclosures policy and trade waste policy for adoption then you have any questions [Applause] that 's it Ellen policies only counselor adopted policies have all been reviewed in those two Suites so that 's everything now unless there 's any changes to best practice or law it 's not anticipated that they 'll be back for another twelve or potentially two years so this report for the meeting next week deals with fast-track coming up locations which is a specific creation of plumbing drainage regulation 2019 so in the past we 've offered attract applications that the recently adopted fees and charges schedule doesn 't include a fee for large great applications from the market for the from this time on the purpose of this report is to formalize that position of not offering fast-track applications the reason for that is that we 've done quite a bit of work with our team and brought down our averaging average application processing times to four and a half days for determination so there 's no longer really a need for fast track applications so the recommendation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fast track applications in accord with the the regulation most none of them really use their service and most of them things are not very happy with the turnaround times of council so that 's good that 's good to hear it 's certainly it 's better than it has been until recently and very few applications have been fast-tracked it 's about 30 and sometimes in the past we hadn 't been able to turn around the fast track applications within the time frame so although not paying for a fast track application they weren 't getting a material turned abuse application or accommodation as a short-term accommodation and it 's like had addendum to allotments of land with a land area of 2.7 hectares no it 's currently vacant the lens like had in the low-density residential zone of the planting scheme and the application was in fact accessible so went through a public notification process where a council received 42 property provisions diplomatic submissions proposal comprises two components as I said student accommodation of workers accommodation components of Webber 's accommodation is 26 bedroom units were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing student accommodation has 24 units three bedrooms and a maximum of six persons in each connotation the development includes a communal open space area barbecue shelter and facility and on-site car parking dedicated on-site parking area the application was originally it 's been something to two changes that was originally at lunch with us back in February 2019 and yes but subsequently changed talk about the kind of proposal the children they asked took a look at today 's so overall this 50 units and maximum 300 persons looking at the locality this part of this land area is represented as stage three of what not crossing the state with the stages one and two already developed access by Georges Terrace and Morgan Y and currently approved mainly for low-density residential dwellings the site separated by physically separated by a 25 meter drain and leaves it on as a sort of excluded parcel and has a development history in the twin 2011 the side was approved by the planning barn court for a 40 acre unit sorry 36 minutes down development and more recently in 26 Daniel 's approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time considering this character closer as a report details the density or the low-density residential areas predominantly developed for low-density residential purposes that doesn 't preclude the development of multi-dwelling developments and it anticipates a maximum density of 25 equipment drawings per day and this side of the land area 2 1 hectares could have a maximum development density of 55 of the dwelling cells marginally below their proposed development as Mark something below the maximum density for this area when we look at multi residential uses there 's a equivalent derring-do we 're making density that 's applied within the planets game and that 's detailed we 're going to probably the report David councilors to review the current proposal is has an equivalent density of forty nine point six equivalent dwellings per hectare so again not illegal ayat the maximum density of the support details the sporting infrastructure that 's developed in the locality and sites reconnected to basic count eleven services engineers of applies Leah p.m. the road environment of Georgia Terrace and Morgan way and Georgia Terrace is considered to be a link within our local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will provide a connection throw to the adjoining rural land which time in the future look like look at the dot for a residential purpose so it 's intended that the term Georgia Terrace link be dedicated not constructed but to connect through to the adjoining area and provide that connection in terms of car parking sites the development self is proposed to provide 74 employers garage spaces and 51 open visitor spaces and that overall results in the short for ten car spaces as the council 's planning scheme policy in a development of this type although there 's a shortfall that 's still a fairly significant amount dedication and car parking and they 're suggested also baby use of a maxi taxi service that would provide some transport opportunity coordinated by the operator and the planning report summarizes the backed up short for a discretion should be used to support that shortfall this time there 's a commentary about landscaping and amenity impacts within the report as well and a Lincoln section as you expect with 42-pound property made submissions regarding the public notification for the development services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were raised by submissions and an office of response accompanying of but if I might summarize quickly the the range of concerns related to impacts on infrastructure impacts on the amenity of the locality one theme that came out through public submissions and councillors might be aware is that the moment way and Georges Terrace estate has been developed with a range of dual occupancies and dwellings with secondary dwellings that allege to be used for an orgy of occupancies and countess attacking a separate compliance action against operators that have been identified as using those facilities unlawfully sensibly that some concerns provided and the thoughts of the presidents in the locality that an increased densities albeit detached from the main part of one more Crossing estate has compounded some of their concerns so that was the feature through some of the submissions but any of the dual occupancies that exist in that locality that aren 't subject to councils current enforcement action have been constructed hopefully and in accordance with variables the planning sting so though it 's a summary page for our councillors to review in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration of all those matters the report concludes that sparking an alloy density residential zone that there 's locality and considerations in the location which make this site acceptable to be recommended for approval that we can impose conditions to deal with any of these the many the impacts our interest infrastructure impacts that might be experienced in the locality and the one of the ways that counsel 's office assessment officers were considering resolving an amenity impact on the northern boundary of the slightest we are requesting that there be a reduction of one duplex unit the northern boundary of the site which would result in 12 instead of 14 units a lot of that more than a boundary resolving in the 8th egg yards reading yards of the properties in May making Street to the north having less densities at that property boundary that interface will also be fenced and landscaped and that 'll take the overall number of units that would be approved for this development to 48 units further reducing their the densities begin the conditions that are recommended it 'll company any approval condition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reduction of the units there 's also some use specific conditions that require maximum occupancy of 16 occupants per-unit open space areas condition 13 required to muscles of Cybermen of the impacts and only operator will not operate between the hours of 00 p.m. to 00 a.m. to further reduce effects it 's a daytime landscaping requirement of submission to the council it 's also a requirement to incorporate an agricultural buffers because the land to the north is not West is some being used for a chronic purpose there 's requirement in the car parking conditions to also ensure there 's no on the street car parking within Georgia Terrace or walking away and of the allocated number of car parks be provided to service the development along with PR maxi taxi o minibus some top service soldiers condition 39 of the approval condition forties across the land dedication of Georgia Terrace to continue through to the lot the north so that we may realize into the future a not connected everything 's now capitalism rather than the information package that you receive there was a an infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested to consider the infrastructure charge that was an error within that charge have talked about a in interest charge for like payments so that their templates will be modified before itself before any infrastructure charge notices sent out should the council the society endorses development proposed through Georgia terraces through the chair the actual there 's no prohibition on Morgan wine being utilized for access purpose the primary access purposes for is through Georgia Terrace and car parking areas are connected at that point so the develop engineer 's are of the view that the ability for some cars to continue there 's not a concentration of vehicles on the road sorry kids mister question there mr. chairman redemptive is the structural racism you see that increased what so referred through the changes the point that I was clarifying there within the information package of the counselors were given there was the inclusion on the inner structure charge of the lake payment interest payment that was applicable that 's not consistent to the policy and the template that was identified was in Arabic council council stop being asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young resolve known as a councilman did rise that the veterans are concerned of the maggots that respond to clarify and visit historic interest rate that was linked to the same interest rate used to applause equity rights which is subsequently been reduced by regulation [Applause] it 's melted into a 20-piece application for a hotel Taman use and they 're shot by Bob at 6.99 7x7 pagará rode it adjoins that we know as the stop also shopping center complex there on the interior to the gara the lands like added in the district centers own a commercial

interface and the development proposes to build out the top of that detention basin and is yet period over the top about detention basin and the silent about disappointed at 16 meters from the upfront property boundary of this commercial site to the car arrived which caters for a young proposed 10 meter future drivers of presumption foreshadowed by six major setback for this building and the development proposes an additional 19 car spaces taking the table car parking allocation for land to 403 car park as the German report there 's quite a bit of detail in there about the district center design code itself and what it 's trying to encourage in terms of land use building design and the transport infrastructure connects to that development and besides our story developed to the largely developers for a commercial purpose starts well connected with joining ride wise and pedestrian connections one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts of the development and predominantly that relates to environmental impacts of noise and lighting from the development lining in perspective in facts to nest and sea turtles and the noise in terms of the operation of noise packs on the potential impacts on the joining residential uses that are coded on the opposite side of began arriving Gentile what a catalyst said as a commentary there relating to noise and lighting within now the report but the applicant did provide an environment of the noise level impact assessment to support the development and it does require further reporting to be provided once the users actually constructed an operational to ensure that it can completely make its own noise objectives it 's also required to broadly comply with environmental protection noise policy under the Environmental Protection Act and the officers band liquor and gaining regulation to the liquor licensing also has a close look at the noise effects released some types of developments including amplified music in and the like so that cancels conditions Pakistan but there 'll be a requirement that noise management be closely looked at through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar type of development within the bugera my calorie we 've also recommended that a patron management plan be incorporate into the proposal so that the operators got some responsibility to ensure that there 's not congregation all noise impacts at closing time for those uses in car park areas and other parts extents of the building most of parking at 403 parks that are total for the site equates to one space per 21 square meters of gross floor area for this development and so the parking allocations considered to be adequate considering also that the peak use of of this particular premises at times will be out of step with that the picky usage of the shopping center use as well as you 've done to the layout rental car parking that sets trap assessment data dental condition counselors all know that there 's a specific condition this condition line talks about the patron management plan for implementation conditions ten and eleven deal with the operating hours that have been requested there 's a condition there a condition 14 relating to lighting and the duck star compliant lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the development and condition 16 17 and 18 deal with noise requirements and the requirement to submit we have approved the revised acoustic report to recalculate noise impacts loss the sources of Mars have been actively determined to those conditions as I understand doesn 't change any conditions on the existing development through the care that 's that 's corrects that was some this proposal card self to further regulate the lighting you know to the broad shopping center stop that trust a balance the the needs for lighting for public safety against the car parking areas and not forcing on jeweler or soft lighting impacts is that palliative is the chair so it can be assured that by their every extra spill from the side of of life with regard to you know what we 're trying to do a prepare with excessive lighting already existing in number of orders threading through the chair and there 's there 's obviously going to be some additional lighting associated to this development that we 've how 's their arm standard condition which shall cause them to design and install external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that we can start the balance between now the new development and is complying as closely as I came to those environmental criteria councils aware we have presentation from the presidents of Bundaberg East and Bundaberg West Rotary clubs their intention is to mount the motor fective from 1 July become on the boat set 4 o clock under the East have an existing contract with Council for a a a deed agreement to conduct the annual Book Fair what their works is that councils library actually goes through and do sessions part of our collection all books that are no longer being borrowed or those books of the surface to what we 've got and effectively provide those to fund the very least we then store them and then every year conduct an annual book sale the proceeds of that sale is split at the moment presently 5050 between counsel and Bundaberg East how they use them for terrible purposes Council uses the libraries and to purchase additional resources in make available to the public and borrowers under the East Melbourne West indicators we said that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so effectively the existing arrangement have to be amended additionally they also said that the current situation with kovat and like they 've struggled to get funding and raise money and have an staff council would reconsider current revenue split 50-50 split with view to providing a more favorable return to them so the recommendation in the report here is that when we agree to the council agreed we 'll consider to agree to a 40 split with the city percent favorite under the central Rotary Club and that based on Vice former chief legal officer we would have to into an indeed to a soft Dean of assignment which is to reflect the change in name of the Rotary Club from Bugaboo keys to the abundantly exemplary club and also approved councils of the mind to increasing to the revenue split 50 to 40 in their favor the current deed was entered into in 2017 for five year period expires and to 2022 have you taken questions I just got maybe some comments and questions regarding this they mentioned the other week that there 's many places where this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering whether we are able to make me offer some help to increase marketing around this if only if it hasn 't been marketed at all it 's very easy to get the extra 20% in sales which is going to give them their 1,200 as well as council and going forward if the event grows I just sort of feel like obviously changing this 40 split is the easy thing to do because we can just sign in your document that stuff but I 'm just wondering if there 's opportunity where we can help the Rotary Club as far as marketing using they are using Facebook if we were to do some social media advertising that 's only going to be a few hundred dollars and I think the outcome going forward will be a lot more advantageous for both parties the other thing I wanted to ask is they have mentioned that it 's excuse me simply because of Cogan this year so would this 6040 arrangement just be for this financial year would it be going forward even when there wasn 't the impacts of Coburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task so just just something thought around the table that was a little dreams agenda the intention is to amend the remaining period of the date so until 2022 celebi continue on at 40 split with the council was over due to wanting to do that but they mentioned covert is one issue but also said the costs and amount of labor that they require just put the books out together this many but it 's cutting into and they say that it 's a significant load at the moment which is why there are after additional money so cover think one of the reasons and regard some acumen in the existing date that 's already our commitment from councils that we would support them at marketing so we 've put it on our webpage previously no website previously and certainly you put on Bundy now and others when it comes up so there 's already commitment and existing deed that we would try to promote those specifically through existing channels to support myself do we charge for the facility when they run that we share the cost usually depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a storybook say also to counsel shared good they give it a great news price so for the actual event delay normally one of like here I have the run of the cultural center before pagará depending on if we weighing that random cost how much save would that be for the club because there 's usually some setup days and then the event itself and pack down day so would product don 't you previously noticed my comment is the recommendation before is is particularly in relation to the briefing this represent a 40 split the others dealing with the service clubs being some charges that we reduce relations community or other service clubs across the board just want to reassure everyone here the briefing meeting and that those online that all those matters are taken into account when we go through those matters individually not the recommendations which is just before today so they certainly get disgusting that whatever we can do to help our associations so we certainly spend twenty twenty twenty twenty three just be aware that originally seek to presentation from Community Development Devlin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was previously called our social development action plan which is five to twenty seven in we engage your consultants barelly group to do the work on our behalf and regards to community engagement working with all the networks that we currently have in place to determine what the local need is so that we can put two together the community development strategy extremely important document for our community give it a high level of social disadvantage that we suffer and cancer plays a key role in not only delivering the services to that particular market but also facilitating in a lot of cases and then working with various groups to ensure that we provide services to all those who need them so the Community Development action plan comes out of that so there 's a number of items that can develop a strategy identify specific actions where counsel might be the provider the facilitator odd Network and to identify all those things that we found as a result of this work and I commend the report to you three counselors so it 's a sole supplier arrangements my seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a review undertaken by settle I 've sat in Queensland for all of the proper service the reason they do throughout Queensland for local councils where they patrolled beaches in certain areas five beaches in our particular region we have entered previously contracts or provision of those services from Surf Life Saving Queensland they are effectively I sold supplier for this particular service there is lifeguards Australia we two predominately provide services in regards to pool safety not as much beach safety at certified seven Queensland is provide the specific service given the fact that we are tourists area this is about protection of bathers on our particular beaches are the proposal areas to enter into an agreement three years from June 20 22 June 20 23 at an annual cost of four hundred and forty three thousand four hundred dollars with innocence exclude GST per annum and that provides those services particularly during the summer peak period and still all day periods the reason is has had to come to Council specifically it 's one of the value of the contract in as they are assaults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resolve have you taken questions at Dhahran two streams the changes that has per brief question you go is how long we 'd be supporting the spatially 32 years of service has been operated next time is this one by the big Regional Council and Bundaberg tourism partnership agreement so it 's Council where we provide financial assistance to Underberg tourism to deliver destination marketing on our behalf so that 's obviously attracting tourists from outside our region to beautiful under their region we have done that on a contractual basis with funded formally Bundaberg North Bennett terrorism and more recently but about tourism as a result of they don 't change the value of that was 550,000 per annum lost fifty thousand dollars effectively what we call project specific funding so that 's where the Thunderbird tourism for an opportunity arise to come and present to counsel to seek part or all of their fifty thousand dollars for a specific the intention is to enter into an agreement with fund adventurers to continue that service the current agreement expires this month and so we 're looking into in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pick up effectively from the 1st of July so have illusions of the artistic clarification mr. chairman whilst council substantial amount of money is there still a corporate responsibility as well to support the tourist information centers to promote individual tourism of adventures just to clarify that flows a little unclear on the question so they run the jersey make sense on a behalf that 's right but promotion of the individual terrorist initiatives still require extra support to terrorism but a big tourism limited if they wish to it 's not all about counsel helping out totally with the promotion is that correct there are there a member based organization so they will provide services to members so first and foremost that 's why they set up council provides them funding specifically for the destination marketing and the operation of visitor information centers that Childers jinjin and fund about they also seek funding from intuitive events queensland they get to support destination marketing particularly the Bundaberg region and assess the year so I promote the businesses that are members they promote the region and the destination through our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then obviously on the road the tourism information services through the Visitor Information Center so let 's go into the question I asked that question simply Samara mr. chairman because I think there is some private operators that believe they probably their investment through their council expenditure but it 's really a member organization as well that they can this is an umbrella support for terrorism across every agent that 's what I 'm getting at mr. chair just on three it 's the chance to guarantee say once that the briefs in our minds contribution by the Bundaberg Regional Council of the wall with in English the confidentiality and obviously the agreements that we have with our juries of operators here locally at the state government without identifying their numbers but it would be fair to say that the amount the local government contributes is substantially more than what the state delivers to the agreement without food right we know the primary funders yes mr. Mann Thanks you","(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

QLD 4670, Australia",3891,"my stick why would I stay there take a risk but I can leave the room it 's called free should you go to GT so welcome everyone to the briefing meeting here at the abundant big Regional Council suffer room over to use to see things to be the first time today council this information to regular parking you may be tall so just for clarity and a cosmic Rafi was a signatory to the so council the one as a result of a little bit responded to the current situation just prior to the election one of the changes we made was to regulated parking in the CBD Sarah parking inspectors were redeployed to other areas and council has been voluntary provision for parking a couple months down we 've been approached by the Integra comments and this is said by just numbers last council made for council when we consider that even the fact that some of the restrictions are encoded now are easing and we 're also aware that Brisbane City Council this week as well I 've spoken to some individual shopkeepers the responses very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to say from the city did that always testing to be adequate a box but a nice over the shop papers feelin regulated Harvey actually assisted their business in terms of getting a turnover all the residents that get a compact class in their business so because it was done by Council resolution initially we did a Council resolution obviously to reverse that decision we 're looking for decision next week at the council meeting as to when that would occur the will of the council Easter reinstated staff are recommending stated if you are going to reinstated we kick it off from the first two questions and comments they say okay I affectionately and it means something special about it I can show there was edited obviously would they be for me on issues of points say giving a period of Christ people yeah what the council position next week as to whether you want to give a period of Christ and wide for fines that where we treat for the first week so that will be your tie up to the cancel if that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next report is in relation to a notice of motion Council adopted in its last meeting and I 'll read out the notice of motion was that I give notice that the next Audrey meeting of council a report be provided to our find the role Planning and Development Committee including the identity of three elected members of council and that they 'd be appointed to that meeting so that notice emotional needs to before we look at the council community X when in my report I 've given a brief history of how planning functions in Queensland these are in relation to planning I 've provided a summary of which councils of light size in quite said have a planning committee and which done and then I 've talked about briefly about the fact that if you are they have a planning committee the council needs to determine how many counselors be on the committee very noticeable says but probably more importantly what delegations the council is prepared to give that planetary issue that they wish to have timing the council up until 2016 big Regional Council had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a little delegation to turn the notifications council but having said that they were still counselors to call any application to the tool councilman for determination currently exists with council starting delegation currently so technically taking questions in comments catacombs they do councils are learning just foreshadow that when this matter comes before the next council meeting I 'll be seeking legal counsel to add trip clarity and put the word advisory after planning and development so really outlining outlined the role of a planning and development advisory committee and I think that would address some of the issues in relation to dedications as opposed to confusing my record is written on the basis there would be additional information to the council was pride of a council meeting about what the distinction is yesterday I could just add some more clarification to the numbers relating to the different sections of the state you 've given the chart within the summary in relation to develop decided by delegation of authority and decided by council so in the first instance seq outreaches based on all ten the seq councils left sided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take it out of the broader picture when you take the overall averages of 0.7 point oh one percent being approved so we fit into the category of the knowledge seekers not a city council statistics so just another one for clarity so not average that 's check by the state that is is saying that one in ten applications with council representatives there are some changes obviously to the makeup of the committee 's and the represent given effective for new counselors I 'll just also clarify that there was a question raised about the sister city committee it 's recommended at this stage the sister city obviously so if you just whether you rent or what other committees that besides there may be other opportunities from a wider regional level that make an act to Council and be decided as will the recreation well thank you yes mr. chairman question in regards to the sister city possible arrangements in the future if we were to develop a community committee responsibility for 2020 21 being provided under the government ex sections 97 262 council is able to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between what the call cost recovery or referred to as cost recovery and also commercial the cost recoveries are the fees that council provides and basic has a monopoly on and in the requirement damage that councils does not make a profit on those fees and whether commercial thieves just normal commercial real supply and all the recent charges have been reviewed by the relevant managers and as regulars determined and around long-term initially the piece were generally increased by 3.5 percent and there 's variations for rounding and also in some circuits yes that they may have been moved by another meal just with the little Kozma whether you have been that we can 't make a profit as such the council does have a calculation model and that the managers will go through in identify all the tasks that are involved in a fee in cost area against the employees wages as well as on costs or around employment or so of course the department goes on costs in line with what we do for national competition policy for the water research businesses units as well so presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to see the financial summary all around I said the first of nine 2020 is presented if council and this is required and the government acts we have a summary every month or two at the end of each month and in the summary they press postings of 19 and related in the queries the points probably to both 1919 doth never impact on our fees and charges the FISA chapters are tracking slightly below budget and will be impacted by cope it 19 it 's the same as interest so interest on rates and that 's part of the council stimulus package that we 've produced II stopped charging the interest on rates but there was a slight impact the and also the interest rate is below what we would have expected this time you and we when we did the budget with the grants and subsidies and expect them there to basically come in online with this state was expecting the advance payment of their fiscal assistance grants to come through or their the state happened to have their their budget that 's been confirmed we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four million dollars tied up in that that we 're expecting the country so obviously it doesn 't that 's going to have a significant impact on our operating result for the currently with the recurrent expenditure and employee cost a tracking among budget the materials and challenges materials and services we expect will be below budget at the gym and that 's only due to some of the non capital projects that will be outstanding for capital expenditure it 's raining fifty-eight percent including a attention or about 56 percent and just on capital construction which is a fair margin behind where we expect to be at this time in the year however there 's a large program works as scheduled to be completed this financial year so it 's making to be a lot close as well at the gym but there will be some carry overs in that budget some of that will be related to projects where there is not purely related to council there 's fun being in another agencies are involved further projects from a cash point of view the we have no short-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 and the initial impact over prop the next six months we don 't see any cash shortcomings we would have to look for additional working capital so at this stage I think we 're very comfortable bed with the right status just a nightmare that once again we haven 't been actively recovering the debts forever and the last couple months and we have seen our drop-off in payments on rates coming through there so expect that to continue to the 30th of June and the other deaths are also decreasing decreasing and there 's probably reflecting that we 're not undertaking the parking restrictions at the moment appliance for we 're bringing for interesting that space also we 've finally received our final payment for the multiplex and although that 's not in these figures but it has come through in mind as a but at half a million dollars that comes from that kind then any questions the climb what Senate relationship also and the multi multiplexer the construction of the multiplex we 've got grant funding for 13 that the final plan was just the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding rights I think to consider communications class up to the interesting reaction so I 'll speak moratorium nitro comes to something like ice for the rig 3ds J its Anthony what 's the total figure outstanding as at the end that was the start of my nearly three by now seven point six seven point six in response to policy workshop that we worked through recently councils officers are presenting to councillors for adoption our suite of cases in May the policies are adopted to ensure compliance with legislation requirements or provide guidelines of matters which may impact the community or support council strategic objectives or assist in the delegated decision-making of council staff the policies have been recently reviewed and further reviews will occur annually if required by legislation by annually or in response to changes in law or best practice for adoption at this month we have the acceptable request guideline policy version 5 the administrative action

the endorsement of the employee Code of Conduct policy version 1 questions that 's about so it 's just so I 'm referring to the typical request guideline policy paragraph 5 which says customer requested service should be directed through counsel CRM system is such a center that 's it do we need to capture steps in salt in there because quite a few counselors to use that this has all been results you say are they all right so it 's just a wife might review an existing just clarify as well just it 's a little one 300 opposite coming to that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the organizational structure under 6.9 X resolution structure the last structure that was adopted by council was 2080 the structure that 's put up today or adoption is actually the same propensity structure was adopted in has been no changes in that structure all personnel and we 'll place it we probably should say the last two years and putting their fourth council man dot to comply with the requirements of the let me move on to the no.1 its is a reconfiguration a lot application over land of 50 CSR depo road Childress councils all notice South reading the report that it was originally submitted as one into seven lot subdivision but through the assessment process was modified a couple times by the applicant that 's currently being assessed which is running five lakh development proposal so the lens approximately five point three hectares in the area which is just a touch over twelve I think EULA in the rural zone of the claiming scheme and as I said the applicants proposing a window through our five lot subdivision with Lots sizes in the range of 3,100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square meters at the largest the lien itself is like handed from a three point five kilometres northwest of Childers and they 're 1.5 kilometers from apple tree Creek and being in rural zone councils will note that the application has gone through impact assessable citizen process an assessment process that included a public notification period the report itself details the assessment benchmarks that 's the applicable parts of the code that the assessment officers have looked at an assessment of the application and some of the key features are there in section 3 of the report the primary considerations that cancel offices of looked at is that the manias like Simon Says will playing area codes and rules and codes that I 'm to protect and preserve rural land and the proposal is a proposal which aims to create moments that are below the 100 in a minute allotment size and the other thing to put this proposal forward and the basis that police surrounding an locality its characterized by a mix of a lot of rural parcels but also smaller world lots that are used for residential purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the like calories at a fairly fragmented rural landscape and the assessment details the officers views of proposal against the host and relevant codes we also apply States and supporting infrastructure for the development particularly on the right characteristics in that term in that locality and there 's an engineering analysis return survey the requirements in relation to basic supporting infrastructure with a new development on those Lots as well as that in that road area there 's a sort of big gaps Republic notification and there 's a section that reported the details the submissions that council stated during of a medication period we received five submissions remembers the public and the matters that they rise to date out in the report with a officer response but could be summarized as concerns about the impact of introducing residential style Lots in a rural area and the agricultural interface or the impacts that might be experienced through reverse amenity between the residential uses an agricultural use there 's a kangaroo lay mind that runs at the bottom of the hill and that 's a concern or a focus to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't impact on camera like infrastructure concerns raised about tongue traffic safety and access on the roadway also just enough general amenity changes and noises associated with additional residential activities of might occur on any new life that was created this is a commentary within the report of the outcome those matters as a summary point and the offices are balanced those some considerations and recommend a proposal for approval those reasons for those decisions there and on 7th report but essentially or in summary on details that spot the rule and designing and the land hasn 't been used actively for our cropping purposes is small in its size the surrounding locality is developed for rural residential purposes from an engineering perspective offices believe that these new lots be serviced adequately with infrastructure and a very well positioned near applies to existing townships making it a suitable area for a rural residential expansion despite ton the capital or zoning just some of the conditions that are suggested to be applied to the development of detailed engineer schedule one of the proposal and conditions of note that there 's some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a widening of between 700 ml on 1 meter of road widening which should assist for some of the access issues there 's also a requirement to see all access handles to ensure it 's not dust or other impacts from non vehicles traveling down access handles that service to of the allotments stormwater drainage with an item that needs to be considered so that turning siteworx don 't run off to the joining properties Gallus follows will note that there 's two suggested conditions relating to the agricultural interface issues one is condition 23 that identifies a requirement for proposals one and five take agricultural buffers in place they have vegetative buffers to remain in place to ensure that any impacts when you 're joining agricultural land don 't versity impact on the residential uses been created nearby or set up building envelope condition and that 's primarily about getting a building envelope that 's a minimum of one hundred and forty meters away from the chair the theorem there smaller than the proposed a lot so if we look at proposed a lot to being just under four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite side of the road where somewhere between two and three thousand square meters those Lots were actually created through one dozen of them mill site down down the back there suppose that 's with Travis on one hundred years ago through historical subdivision the more recent rural residential land over here which grants fly vacant lots which is a bit more typical of an you as a rural residential estate standard night the next item is the gatha 's obviously see I said I won and over 19 economic stimulus package to really support support program so the minute that was approved by council on the 20th the meeting of the 24th March I 'm airline is one of these Dilys items under that package was support I was going to program it before like the sporting organization the Technos result okay with 19 so you because in the record it 's just that cycling wouldn 't really be effective the kid so council is one of the exercises that staff undertook was to do a survey of a local sporting organizations to get an idea of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their organizations that was done in conjunction with our local advisor for queensland government sport wreck the keep three key things that came out of that was that local clubs are concerned about the financial stress difficulty in maintaining the grounds facilities during this period and worried about recovery about where the members and volunteers will actually return after all this is over so additionally there was a magical transport survey that was undertaken which we 've got a copy of which indicated similar sort of things across Australia we also assessed what other councils were doing in this base to see what sort of level support was provided and the proposed policy that we 've got here for approval fits in with what most of the local councils in the area of doing and regards to the quantum of support one of the things we tried to assess was what 's the most appropriate measures by how do assess who 's going to be need the general you seem to be by much councils this is about those who are owners so those who either on clubhouses look around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to looking after maintaining grounds because they 're live close and organised actually that effectively would select require and spend money when activities weren 't occurring as to without electricity the still would add fine bills so what happen maintain their grounds to whatever building insurance no the applicants I mean other outgoings as opposed to other clubs that period simply use facilities have done so in tension with the policy was to target those specifically look at hardship with maximum up to 5,000 per application they could put in with a total budget proposed for the next one each year over 200,000 so at least forty groups could be assisted I think that was the key points with the policy sort of talks about the sound effect we would want to see financials and support of those with up to is mr. mayor on item t3 the other one is with t8 the louia and also I have a real conflict and I have a war allocation with some without you both of the Paradise teamwork so I 'll leave them as well see how I 'll be declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I previously had a lease on a farm which gave me legal and physical access to some water of previously declared a conflict of interest and that the lease is now finalized a few months ago because licensed the finalization lace and this matter all day today it 's a coffee coming just waiting to read there 's some distance between by holding that thank you three years to jail on all beat clearing if perceived conflict of interest in autumn t 11

Mitchell yeah made MC planning and development is an area that creates great public interest and generates the most robust community discussion and engagement that 's exactly why the portfolio should continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve our Kennedy by listening to people in the local area and then representing their views on council councillors are expected to represent the interests of the community I believe not have enough planning and development portfolio takes away a right as residents or special interest community groups active to put forward their views to a nominated spokesperson who is seem to be their representative around the table I believe the community is elected 10 councillors under me expecting that a portfolio of one of council 's most important roles planning and development would continue where the decision-makers and we should not be agreeing to dismantle a process that gives confidence to ratepayers but their elected councillors are accessible as discussed previously in relation to obviously a lot of council particularly in the areas of comments and guidance from the from a triple see from the a office of in the independent office as well as looking at our Cara and ramifications or valcara across the number of councils particularly the larger councils for all time conductor involved in those particular areas as well as certainly the

there was this it was counseled about that 's all I get for the SEC counseling faith so I just like to speak in relation to the question between a potent flexion and having time to think as explained to counselor Mitchell is the items are now before us the motion is a relation to these particular portfolios now you know that we 're counselors so once you know obviously making a statement but the statement has to be and you 'll go through a little bit later in relation to some model rules for the meeting so it had to be to the actual motion that 's particular Thank You mr. made me I want to request the dependence of the medium business with my concerns that a planning and development portfolio has not been assigned to an elected member of the Council said that could be included in minutes please and I will move an amendment no sir it 's pertinent because later on there 's an item that all counselors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the conduct and a big divided on the actual meetings inside bombing it 's the second power of one division so it 's all being explained in there just general running of meetings okay so cancel bans did you want to note that in in the technical part of the report the council assigned the role of planning and Berman to a committee of council comprised of three elected members of council to be announced at a later date so he invited yeah so these are substantial determined from natural emotion that 's before council or I 'm happy the table back and bring that back at another day or you receive that it 's apart it 's a small part of an amendment of that substantial motion before us it would be additional motion talking roughly about the same issue from the committee so the way at which I would suggest it would handle of his council of balance ago second is that you didn 't deal with this motion before you establish the point five days additional action because without doing any better terminus we 're assigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provide two to the community so I 'm like it in some way you 're affected from this meeting who 's on that committee would obviously need to be decided later on some like one to sunlight there 's no new council about I 'll bring it back to is we 're doing portfolio not committees the bottom side today with deciding on as historical in nature obviously I 'm happy to I think so like you 've noticed that at a future meeting the next ordinary meeting of council will be provided to outline the role of a Planning and Development Committee but the still adjustments including the identity of three elected members of council yeah to deal with that and then go back to the original notes for even less right so we have to deal with your nation first so obviously so council bars has put forward a motion did everyone hear that you got a second please the report be brought to Council at the next ordinary meeting outlining the role of a Planning and Development Committee to include three elected members of council and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before would have a seconder place no we have to finish that 's been put forward I never set before we even go back to the portfolios we have to sell this one first so can I have a second the plate council can ask suits who we would you got to get a second of first and then we go into the actual particular so he 's got a second a place secondary is counselor Mitchell now back to so now the motion is put you counselor honor you want to speak in relation to a technical manner because otherwise this motional go to the vote as to me I want to run amendment to that equation can I hear the amendment for I 'd like to consider the hull because substantially changing commercially it 'll really council balance identified three councilman 's finally my amendment this is to amend that to either the whole council I think that we could discuss that so the matter is is Council and has called forward motion the motion is second then the amendment is the substantial change to the motions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account we got the first vote on this motion that what you 've brought up main human discussion I have a text and the next main forum discussion at the next meeting in relation to how that work rate I guess so second the motion to thank the council Sun in the 20 years I 've been in the role I 've never been to a council where elected members at a time when we 've got legislation that 's coming around as the memory to before it 's not necessarily going to be an easy job but we 're not elected to make easy decisions related to make the right decisions and the community would expect that we would not assign such an important role simply to protect our tails that 's not what we 're here I asked you to be very wise and use the counsel that properly so what are suggesting counselors is that we have three we asked for three counselors to put their things forward to be part of committees that committee would then look at and assess applications that come before it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that recommendation would then go to a full Council for the termination so in other words so an application comes in gets assessed by officers it gets looked at by the committee by three individual counselors and they make a recommendation to the whole counsel as to whether or not it should be approved or rejected or whatever I think it 's important I think it 's the best way out and I don 't think that we need to have the whole council on it because that 's just going to confuse any speakers against so I 'll put the motion motion first all those in favor they 's against there is again spend council Trevor Council Auto Council Dempsey to bring the matter to the to the next council in let me just clarify help doesn 't come it couldn 't be an amendment because there 's advice need to establish portfolios what you were suggesting was not an Indian question it was a second remark but it was around about the same issue and you 're just it 's barely clarify the motion that we put forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original nation that was put forward by myself and any other queries in relation to the discussion because we 've got so counselors yes I 'm just want to ensure that counsel is the information that I discussed previously we 'll obviously for part of the information be supplied to the council committee so just to make sure the particularly on council is that information will be brought forward again so now we 're just going to go to the vote in relation to the original motion that was put forward these all those in favor those against turning regional matters community so the original one the clarity again is all those in favor those against Council will be against so noted the the motion is moved the excise is part two of the motion and Arlo move the council 's the allocated applauding portfolios the economic development is made Jack Dempsey our organizational Services Council with Cooper water of life Council of Bartels roads of drainage councillor Trevor parks and gardens councillor honor waste recycling council McLaughlin sport recreation council events habberman Community Services Council Tracy the airport open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enforcement it 's our Council named Mitchell arts culture events counselor John levon can I have a seconder please second account sort of Cooper any council wish to raise any queries or speaking against the motion no all dacing bebo those against just there was one that put their hand up so that will be in the negative okay counselor McPhee isn 't it negative can others ask counsel is dis as far as private I 'll give you better advice is when they come to a motion that 's gone through and we 're bailing on their games they said if you 've got a technical side I particularly asked does any council that we sense where it salvations that is your time to actually ask any technical advice because once emotions being moved and second I 'm sorry mood voted on that is the finalization of it okay so I 'll just these days I 'm happy foot because there 's first time for a new people here today is councillor Mitchell in the so that we 're happy not to have a planning and development this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're hiding our main cast aside [Music] that 's not being discussed in there in this area it 's a separate part of the motion so I 'll just put the other motion sorry by voting just to clarify what me amazing the counselor will say sorry say that 's a clarify that you 're actually there before you is the actual portfolios and the person is assigned to those portfolios as part two of the original motion before us client and ownership so I just wanted it so I 'll just put it to say I just noticed advise counselors and even to the community they 're listening these these matters start many many weeks before and in the interest of openness and transparency there is many opportunities for counselors in particular to ask any questions any questions of elected councillors and of the actual general managers and the CEOs to be able to clarify any particular questions or views not so much abuse but any technical advice leaving are leading into the actual finalization of the council meetings that however saying that too in no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they see fit at the council time so as soon as it goes on you 'll see that it 's about doing all of the preparations beforehand so anyway I 'll just that 's just by way of clarity in relation to how we go about processes so part 2 of the item D I now put they all

any councillor that wishes to meet in relation to the budget obviously completed I can slaughter Thank You mr. mayor and councillors stop this has been one of the most trying finally respect I think that I 've experienced in my career as a councillor we 've experienced severe restrictions on business due to KO it and I want to congratulate that council council officers for the work that they 've done on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay financially viable and we have a lot of businesses in our community that have suffered greatly we 've got a lot of businesses that have actually excelled and provided services that normally wouldn 't be provided to the community and I commend all those mr. me one of the most concerning and a factors of this budget to me has been working through the workshops at Council which we 've had many personally in relation to the agricultural rating the value of general has did an evaluation across our region and the value in general is come to a figuring on agricultural land that has risen the evaluations by 46% average that means that some of our agricultural land has gone 0 some has gone up as high as 300 percent and this is most disturbing to people who are caught up in that especially people who are traditionally farming and you know in a way that they have the generations they are affected by the leg evaluations of new cropping and congressional as people that are doing new cropping programs across our region of adds to the diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's caught up in that and I think my personal opinion is that the value in general has to get things a lot more right than main they have this time in regards to the rainbow matrix of the many types across our region they basically volcanic types soils that go from red soil to dry soil to black soil and rock the earth cross and some of this way is not to the value that the higher level land is that 's being used for some new cropping is coming into the area as a council where workshops have been very concise and I do thank everybody including the staff for the information before I 'm disappointed that we haven 't been able to come to an arrangement that probably makes up for the problems that they brought about by the value of generals departments valuations we 've done the best we possibly can without reducing the rate in young people who have got you know zero lives in the evaluation and that would have been a very unfair advantage I think that there 's a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view in relation to how we portray to the regular general in the future you know we perceived by the outcomes of the valuation process because it certainly has affected people in our region tonight commiserate and diverse but from my point of view of depth at my best in the room and I congratulate Council as a whole on the outcome of this budget thank you think you can smell the stinky stuff thank you you 're just further to comments from Council or honor mr. mayor I would just like to bring to the attention of all the public came to everybody that some court in 2037 ratepayers will see no increase in their rates this year forty two thousand and thirty seven people will see no increase in their races and in fact someone sees that decrease this year so we 've taken a very solid line to the future in making it easier for people to take over and giving them the assurance that with the aging system through these tough times so I make that very clear to the community and to our main path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still receive their one hundred and sixty five dollar benefit this year there 's some ten thousand one hundred six of those and they 'll all ten that comes at a cost of 1.7 million so the community can be assured that we 've put them first when it comes to this this budget and we start to work very hard in conjunction with the councillors thank you very much sir mr. mayor councillors staff I wasn 't wretch like my fire counselors on the effort that they put into this year 's budget as council honor and councillor Cooper already indicated it 's been a difficult budget to bring together this year with valuations coming in and also coded 19 playing such a major role in the region over the past six months and beyond I 'm proud of what we 've been able to achieve I think that the works program that delivers full employment for us that delivers on those footpaths roads drainage upgrades through waste and water treatment plants is something positions this community well going forward into the future it 's always difficult when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairness side of it and I think that 's one thing that we have tried to do in this budget is to look at what is fair and what we can deliver well you have very important that this council was it as good financial position prior to the pelvic nineteen because if we weren 't and you 're seeing a number of councils around Queensland having some major effects upon their budgets because of the financial position they are in prior to this year 's budget I think it 's proved that we 've taken a look at our finances we make sure that our borrowings are limited and we 're in a position to be able to go forward next year it 's exciting to be able to continue to deliver the program that we will this year for all of our ratepayers because I think it 's important that we provide balanced impetus that ability for the community to see that there is a future here and a very bright future Thank You mr. mayor councillors capsule for cinema site standing orders and giving those counselors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document by its very nature is highly complex and again this budget but I use this opportunity just to raise some concerns in relation to issues that council on a balloon attitude and then is in relation to the unusual problem precedented increases in valuations in the category 7 which is coastal ocean front and category 9 which is agricultural land the young I note that the the rate that dollar has been reduced marginally but we 're still seeing property owners experiencing 40 plus percent increases in their valuation and that is also reflected in the rate from the dollar for that particular category I guess the only other time that I 've seen anything of this magnitude has been when the three former Shire Council 's and the City Council amalgamated and there was huge disparities between the regular dollar of those former councils and we had to bring them together in some way I disappointed that council didn 't have the opportunity to explore further the opportunity to look into bandung as it 's known abandoning within a category based on bearing thresholds of property valuations I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who infected by the blight increases and then I also noticed that following the amalgamation that the council thought was unreasonable to suddenly bring everyone 's rates up to the same and so in some cases Cadbury 's were brought in over a phase event period of some years and I would like to have seen that considered a bit more as I said having said that it 's a complex document I 've considered carefully whether to support it but I think it 'd be irresponsible not to support and indeed a list of majorities and support it then basically bringing council operations to halt so I appreciate the fact that I 've been able to express my concerns and I 'm hoping that we can look further into different methods that we can apply to try and soften the blow of those who 've got such like valuation increases and therefore rate increases thank you Thank You councillor Barnes the other council was to comment and relation to the budget so thank you everybody and thank you for both of these those opportunities and comments in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standing orders be returned I have a seconder please secondly council bar all those in favor is against next item to business these are idle to in relation to differential general rates like all counselor to back yeah I think it was Mary and I now move that I assure interception eighty one of the local government regulation 2012 code of the categories into which ratable land is categorized the description of those categories and the sure interception anyone in brackets for and only one in brackets 5 but the local government regulates them to 2012 that the method by which the land is to be table as to be identified and included in the appropriate categories as follows and you can see that on the screen the council deliberate delegates are two council delegates the chief executive officer the power of assurance to section 257 of the Local Government Act 2009 and sections 81 in brackets for and only one in brackets 5 of the local government regulation 2012 to identify the differential rating categories to which each parcel of rate gradable land is included by using relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which identifies these years of these rightful lands city the shelter section 94 the Local Government Act 2009 and section 80 of the Local Government Act 2012 the differential general right to be made in levy from for each different differential general rates Caterpie and the share intersection 77 of the local government regulation 2012 the minimum generate to be made and living for each of the different Kenrick general

Mary of the Holy Rosary so when Rossellini came as the parish priest he was parish priest of gained renown perry in Bundaberg but he was an extraordinary man he built this church here in late 18-hundreds and and he he built it according to as I say the Roman style even to the extent that on the top of the building was the Roman cross now you find there 's a Celtic Cross there because Mary 's priest came after him and decided when you needed the Celtic Cross of course so they put a bit of Irishness into it but originally it was just very typical of what you would find in Rome when they did the renovations in about 1926 I think it was they put the two side parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was posts all the way down that there they were so divides into three parts they took the post here and put beams across and you can see the beams there now but they 're covered but you can see where they are and I think there would have been an extraordinary feat of engineering in the in the 1920s but it 's very much part of my life I 100 hundred 25th celebration is a few years ago I looked at all the people that have been baptized in the church during that first year and I 'd always thought our family was here for about five generations and I discovered my grandfather was baptized there and this that first year so I 've met we were here for another generation so I think it 's a remarkable church rotate but there 's a lot of stories there that could be told father Rossellini for example is buried over there and there 's a plaque there he 's on a memorial stone and we wouldn 't spend a lot of time here from the school we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it 's a it 's a place where people of experience great joys and pray sorrows like weddings and baptisms and celebrations and then also funerals and at those times when there 's people gather for pray to pray for disasters or whatever so it 's so it 's part of people 's lives and yeah I think it 's a it 's a great gift to the town it 's a great gift for the Catholic people but more than the Catholic people for the whole city because it 's such a different building I I look at some old old photos and I see the the best rate and this monstrous big building and it says something about people 's hope that they could do something like this in those days there,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"

as we can from Bundaberg because firstly it 's a great region it 's a really diverse agricultural basket in bundi you know it 's just will be known for having a very consistent both sort of the rainfall temperatures you know winter temperatures that sort of diurnal variation or the night temperature really lends itself to consistent growth of crops which allows us to sort of produce consistent quality product let me explain a bit great for strawberries I think is because of the weather a few degrees hotter than the south it allow us to grow strawberries in a few weeks in advance so prices are a lot better Bundaberg is the biggest passion fruit producing region in australia everybody who has won raves about them the fact that they 're grown here in this region close to the coast we believe that the red soil here it gives our fruit some magic slave this terrain very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run cheaper enterprises we 've put a lot of effort into our soil so we really believe that by growing the tree we are better off growing the soil so we find that our production is thanks to our soil which in part is is due to what supply be it water or nutrient thunderbirds region for growing is ideal you get two seasons of the year with structures like this we are actually taking our crops through through that winter period to be able to build heat and also be able to take your crop longer into the summer heats as well so the benefits of the region really work for a work for this this type of structure on the farms we have all our irrigation is computerized fertilizer can go through the irrigation as well let 's call fertigation and then in our pack house and we have our new grading machine the machine itself takes photos of each piece of fruit as it goes over cell and the computer decides from those photos which size it is what quality it is so where it needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the potential is out there they 're the kind of industry is growing so to keep our domestic price up we need to do export so Bundaberg has an abundance of good quality water it 's available and itself high-security so when you throw those into any crop within the region I think you 'll find that the longer term asset value of the land is increased simply by the water we 're really proud of the citrus that comes in at a farm and we send it all around Australia and all over the world we part we 're fortunate we 're right on the burnett river here so we pumped straight out of the river and you know there 's an abundant supply of water there as it 's excellent quality water it 's in a very reliable river system we don 't have to be concerned about water availability which gives us certainty around our our plans for the for the future we farm about just over 2,000 hectares of arable land here in Bundaberg that 's a mix of of sugar sweet potato watermelon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 or five I think it was completed we 've had water allocations which have been more than sufficient to be able to allow us to here crop basically to our maximum the Bundaberg brew drinks makes a brewed soft drink and 100% of brewing it occurs in Bundaberg no matter where the product is sold in the world or can in the world the town has wonderful opportunities and we have great regional growth in that in the in the crops area so we get some wonderful crops that we can use and some novel crops that we can try to weave into new products so we came first came to Bundy we got the attention of the industry but first you went successfully a large part of that was because of the support of Bundy you know we were a new strawberry farm people came through buy a lot of fruits at this stage we harvest all their products Hardy husk it all the husk goes to our

got access to land we 've got access the infrastructure of good access to weather so you know there 's four four of the major boxes are ticked to farm into value-added and have a very strong

4670, Australia",940,we 're just doing a bin audit we 're having a look to see what 's in each of these rubbish bins we 're hoping to drop break in you know four different categories one being waste which needs to go to landfill the other being products which could have been recycled and put into the yellow litter bin and then we 've got our organics which is food scraps or garden organics [Music] it 's quite a bit of volume here of food organic waste and all of this waste could be like the composted or used in a worm farm to break it down and reuse the organics we can see from this pile of recycling material this all this material could have been placed in the yellow litter bin things like your milk bottles your plastic containers or your paper and cardboard should be recycled and so this household could probably improve by a bit of Education in their recycling rates bottle caps for example you know these can be just screwed back onto your milk bottles I 'd say this household has done a pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these milk bottles have gone somewhere so they will when in the yellow litter bin but they could have just given them a quick rinse this one probably needs a bit of a rinse it doesn 't know what this had much of a rinse there give a quick rinse put the cap back on the container and shrouding a yellow-legged recycling bin [Music] I guess what we 're looking at here is the food waste there 's a reasonable bit of food waste I 'll guess the main one is just the pumpkin which sometimes they can go off just a matter of storage and and not just purchasing and using within the autonomy period and look the recycling is a great story here and there 's minimal amount of recyclables that has gone into the bin now I 'm assuming that the rest of recycling from this household has gone into the yellow litter bin if we go over to the waste quite a lot of styrofoam that this is the right bin to put your styrofoam in and so look pleasing to see generally a pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's really good looks like this resident must be using their green waste at home and not putting it in the bin so that will be saving at landfill space and also reduce the amount of methane that 's generated at our landfills which is great [Music] now this is a typical bin basically we 've got a small amount of lace that needs to go to landfill we 've got a reasonable amount of recyclables that could have went into the elevated recycling bin we 've got about 20 percent of food waste which is in keeping with our survey results previously and we 've got about 30 percent of our in this particular instance is garden organics which really could be reused or used elsewhere it doesn 't need to go to landfill there 's a lot of apples oranges which really there might be a bit of a bruise mark in it you can cut that out and still use it and just to be the care about your food making sure it doesn 't go style and that you can reuse it use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here all of this can be recycled you 've got things like water blog bottles that you know people don 't even necessarily need to buy the water bottles especially when it doesn 't go into the recycling bin is causing problems to environment the soft drink cans easy just try them straight into your recycling bin easy as well it 's quite a lot of green waste here this could have been taken to one of our waste facilities and we could have reused it and mulch didn 't other options include composting at at home this material was in a compost pile of breaking up pretty readily and could be reused back on people 's gardens now we 're going to weigh each of the portions the waste the recycling the food organics and the garden organics on average our average weight across the three bins of waste was twelve point four kilos the average recyclable material was two kilos the average amount of waste that had to go to landfill was three point three kilos three-d-- organics was three point three kilos of material on average garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of nine point two kilos per bin could have been diverted okay what we found in this little survey is that there 's a lot of material that doesn 't need to go to landfill because those the three elements are recyclable material that could go in your yellow leaded recycling bin you 've got food organics which could be composted or reused or minimise the amount of food wastage in your household and then there 's garden organics which could be diverted and reused or reused at home people can make their own choices but we 'd like to open a conversation with the community because waste going to landfill has a big impact on councils budget and has a negative impact on an environment and we 're all concerned about our future and our children 's future,"(-24.8661482, 152.3464523)"
