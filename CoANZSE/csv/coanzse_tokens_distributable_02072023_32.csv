different locations each month and we visit all the secondary schools in Greater shepparton at the clinic your immunization records will be checked and you can discuss any concerns with the staff your

needs to register or tattoo premises so anyone what that wants to run a tattoo business needs to register with the local council part of our process is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would just plan those visits across a year and then officer would come out and look at the premises we 'd introduce ourselves to the proprietor and we 'd look through the premises to make sure that the equipment 's clean and that they 're following the right process for sterilizing the equipment that they 're using part of the inspection process is that we would also ensure that provider is following the right information about protecting clients and so they need to give them a client information sheet for the procedure they 've done for tattooing they also need to make sure that they 're only tattooing two people over the age of 18 so they need to keep a record of that we also would fill in an assessment sheet and if there was any issues we would follow that up with the time of the inspection and maybe a follow-up visit was necessary the environmental health Technical Officer also visits tobacco retailers to make sure they display in the relevant signs under the tobacco Act we also conduct a test purchase to make sure the retailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 retailers and unfortunately to retailers did sell cigarettes to our test purchaser we followed this up with an interview and provided

business we wash our hands at the hand basin we check to make sure that there is liquid soap for running water and paper towel it 's important that all food handling star wash their hands at the hand basin regularly the use of hand sanitizers and disposable gloves are no substitute for proper hand-washing we look at how the food is stored in the call room to make sure it is stored below 5 degrees Celsius we also look at how the food is stored to make sure that there are no signs of cross-contamination we check the dry food storage area to make sure that the food is stored in containers with

food sampling program our program is designed so that we collect a range of whoo samples some like they 're from take away premises sandwiches ice cream salads premises we also have to collect it from class one premises which are high risk so childcare or aged care so what we do is we plan that in advance and then we head out to premises we don 't tell them we 're coming but when we arrived at the premises we obviously introduce ourselves to the proprietor tell them while we 're there and then choose what food samples we 're going to collect at that time we ask them to make them if we need to then we actually pay for sample within wrap it in our path then to wrap it first how they normally would and then we 'd wrap it in our packaging label it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets taken back to the office in packs with the rest of the samples they get sent to Melvin for analysis and a laboratory in Melbourne it can take about two weeks for results to come back so we explain that sport writers when we 're there they then wait for those results generally most circles pass on the odd occasion they dodge and so we have to go back to the premises and explain with them and try and work out why they may past their results or five levels greater Shepherd and City Council has a mosquito monitoring program and we monitor adults and larvae in the water we 're monitoring for disease back in 1974 when they had rather large floods around here there was an outbreak of Marie belly and colitis and they decided to start up a mosquito monitoring program try and avoid that it involves adult monitoring which is setting up a trap and running it overnight once a week between the months of November and April and we 've also got larvae monitoring as well where we go out and we sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that and see if we can find larvae in that water as well important that we minded for mosquitoes because of the diseases that they can carry that they can pass on to human beings I 've got four adult monitoring stations and we 've got about a hundred and thirty love all sites that we monitor as well we usually test the adult mosquitoes we send them down to an entomology lab in Melbourne it 's part of the Department of Environment and Primary Industries and they count that species the gender of the mosquitoes and then they take samples and try and extract the viruses from those sandals if there 's any samples that come back positive to another virus they then notify the council and the state health authorities we 've got a sentinel chicken program we 've got 20 trucks stored out of the property along the river and the veterinary officers go there once a week and they collect a blood sample and that blood samples sent down to an entomology lab in Melbourne and they can check that blood sample for arboviruses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus is found in the blood samples then notifies the Victorian department of health as well as the council and that gives us two

Australia",2314,well it 's a really long term for a very simple idea which is just building on community strengths but for too long we 've just focused on what 's missing in communities we often do needs assessments of communities to figure out what are their all their problems and how can local government and other agencies would be most helpful and over time communities we 've started to internalize that map of themselves and they 're just focusing on what they 're missing and they 're always looking outside their community for the answers they 're always looking to government for all the answers or can 't do a thing till we get a grant and people forgotten about their own capacity and so it 's about reminding communities and agencies about the incredible underutilized strengths of community one of those key strengths is recognizing every individual in our community everybody without exception has gifts to give to our community their unique knowledge their skills their passions but then increasing they 're putting labels on huge sections of our community that label them not by their gifts but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people by their gifts we use labels like at-risk youth bold people disabled non-english speaking single parent unemployed homeless etc etc etc so that we 've labeled most people in our society not by what their gifts but by what they 're missing and we just focus on what people are missing they become clients in a service system and we focus on people 's gifts they become citizens in our community so it 's the basis for reconnecting people in communities for rebuilding that social capital that we 've lost over time and it 's also about recognizing the communities for this approach to work right communities need to be driving the change it 's not just about utilizing people 's gifts to do business as usual to volunteer on the projects and services of agencies but to really support community Shadid efforts that there 's some things communities do best that there 's a role for government and other nonprofit and nonprofits but there 's absolutely no substitute for community when it comes to things we care most deeply about it and if there are all kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very real needs that we have in our community but if we just focus on the needs or missing out incredible strengths I think the key for building healthy inclusive connected communities is this it requires a change in the part of both communities and agencies in some ways the agencies that are trying to help our communities have contributed to the breakdown of our communities because our agencies are organized into silos according to their function so there 's one silo for the seniors and there 's one 's for the youth and there 's one for people with disabilities and you can 't build community in silos so it 's about how do we get agencies to start focusing on hold places again rather than on separate functions another problem we have with agencies is we have more and more and more professionals doing for communities what they used to do for themselves and what sometimes committees could do better for themselves so it 's about how do we get agencies to step back lead by stepping back and make room for communities to share their gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's some things communities do best on the community side is about how do they change the work they do so instead of always looking outside the communities for the answer is you start to focus on the resources within their communities possess basis for getting a lot more people engaged if you can take those labels off and focus on everybody 's gifts then they become part of the community their clients their citizens so that 's a way to get a lot of people involved currently aren 't part of our community work it 's also about finding out ways other than meanings to bring people together the two often times the automatic responses we need to build community we need to get our community engaged so let 's have a meeting what a stupid idea it 's like the worst way to get people involved in community how many people you know who love to come out to meetings right you know you sign up for that first meeting and you get your name in the sign-in sheet you 're going to be sentenced to meetings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people don 't see results from meeting one meeting just leads to another me nothing ever happens and a lot of people are shy and their child look if you really care about your community you 're going to come toward me but they just sit there they don 't feel like they 're contributing anything that 's how much they care they actually show up so if we really want to get people engaged we need to use other ways to get people involved in community I got a friend who says why have a meeting when you can have a party think about it the purpose isn 't who can adorn the most suffering the purpose is to build relationships and you can do that a lot more through fun than you can through meetings so having more social events more block parties more street parties great way to build community projects i love projects because with projects unlike with meetings there 's always a result short term commitment there 's a role for everybody for young people elders people with disabilities construction workers architects people would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're more likely to come to some meetings but we always lead with the meetings wonder what they say people keep showing up it 's also recognizing all the ways people are organized in our communities often times we 're trying to get everybody to join our group and we forget that most people are already organized they still belong to our group so finding the other ways people are organized in there in in our communities they may be in faith-based groups or in school-based groups or sporting groups or hobby groups there are all kinds of ways people are organized in communities and people only have so much time in their lives and they got the relationships within their existing groups so reaching out to those other organizations in our community and figuring out finding common interests and how we can work together across those different different communities and I think a third one is just finding out what people care most deeply about that oftentimes we 're just out there pushing our agenda what we care about what we 're passionate about it will get paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant to be passionate about then when nobody joins us we said copy for a pathetic right nobody 's apathetic everybody cares deeply about something so rather than start with an answer rather than just try to start with the program you start with the question what keeps you awake at night or what are your dreams for your family for your community because if you can tap into what people care most deeply about give them a sense they can do something about it they 're much more likely to get involved and you spend a lifetime trying to convince them to care about what you care about right and then it 's about starting small so people can actually see results from their participation that people are feeling so powerless these days it 's like you can 't fight city hall you know or you know that knock on door said you know there are problems in your neighborhoods and say why are you a lawyer and the implication was that only wider some politicians have any power in our society which is a pretty sad indictment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that by banding together it 's reflective action that can make change so you don 't start with world peace you don 't start with climate change because people are never going to start in that big stuff because they don 't it 's hard to see change they 're never going to work on the big stuff that if they don 't think they 've net power to make change on their own Street so the first step is to get involved people in small issues in small projects and show them how they can make change through collective action and once they get a sense of the power of people coming together then they 're more likely to work on the bigger issues but they 're going to start there Wow the community is the force of change if you think about everything we care most deeply about is best done by community whether it 's raising our kids that can 't be done by agencies as well as it can be done by parents and committee members taking care of our elders so care is care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community another unique role of community I think is the power to care for the earth that it can 't just be something where you 're creating more and more green technology people actually have to adopt it and people only adopt it if they feel some sense of connection with one another and the place they share in some sense that collectively our actions are going to make a difference just think of yourself as one person is huge planet what difference does it make if I don 't act responsibly have one person but it 's in community we feel some sense of accountability some sense that we can make a difference when it comes to crime police officers can enforce laws but only communities can prevent crime we 're spending way too many resources lining up the ambulances at the bottom of the cliff when we should be busy building fences at the top and that 's the role for community see over and over again to with disasters you 've had so many of them here with the bushfires with the flooding people are totally dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they often realize it when it 's too late seeing social justice no social justice no major social change has ever come top down it all comes bottom-up my country the civil rights movement the women 's rights movement the disability rights movement beginning lesbian rights movement the anti-war movement the environmental movement every every major social changes come bottom-up so without strong committees we can 't make change so if you think in health studies show about fifteen percent of health outcomes can actually be attributed to healthcare professionals in many ways our communities can have a much bigger impact on their health on our behaviors that affect our health on our mental health on the social and environmental and physical and social conditions that impact our health economic conditions so if you think about it there 's no substitute for community when it comes to things we care most deeply about just do it just do it don 't wait for permission you know don 't wait for somebody to ask you just roll up your sleeves and and and have conversations with other people find out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down with the formal and informal leaders find out what they care about find common interest shared interests identify everybody 's gifts and particularly people been labeled by what they don 't have because that 's the basis you get oh so there 's so many people just waiting to be asked waiting to contribute their gifts I I guess those would be the keys you know building the relationships finding out what people care about and identifying their gifts and then bringing people together around sort of a shared vision and it 'll take off right and not waiting for permission just realize there 's a lot you could do as a community don 't wait for the grant don 't wait for somebody in elected office to give their blessing just do it because if you if you can identify what you 've got in your community you don 't have to wait for outside support you can just do it because you 've got incredible untapped resources just incredible resources and the kind of creativity that comes from community it 's just amazing people are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they start thinking that is the norm and then forget about the incredible capacity of community and incredible things people are doing right here whether it 's in the men sheds or whether and sindhu key with the wonderful trail they build or whether it 's you know with a wonderful new playground that 's been built or there are all kinds of things wonderful things happening in this community and that 's really what makes yep in such a special place so we need to get more of that get those stories out and spread it inspire more people bought what 's possible when when people discover the strengths of their community,"(-36.3779777, 145.3979815)"

improvements will be required within the next 10 years to accommodate the additional traffic in the future they say and I think it 's important tonight that the traffic study has identified a series of initiatives that would be required should counsel make a decision to close and be fairly I believe in addition to the works that have been outlined and suggested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to determine some other intersections in and around the ship amazing industrial zone the we deliver worthy of other works of its supplement recommendations made in the report so just to summarize briefly that the major recommendations of the report and some of the additional works that counsel many of these are recommending as part of an overall package and should cancel any decision to close the road probably the highest priority things identified in the report the Hornets dream you do he wrote down the time about internally right around about we know and you will know now that during particular European right on screen there good morning as well we already have substantial traffic backlogs at that rounded out and the new traffic works report indicates that the degree of saturation that that intersection is already over the 10 mark and so the report is basically telling us what we already know that is done intersection legs and weight of a network now and council having received that report will need to consider works that are required at that intersection now regardless of the situation with spca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the pnp performs reasonably well at the moment however it will reach their theoretical saturation if andrew fairly Avenue wasn 't close and in conjunction with both traffic works our own engineers we 're recommending two major changes the array is the signaling of the intersection of friar street a railroad right and then the removal of the EE that exists at the moment to straighten out fries freed all the way through and the synchronization of the intersection of fry history and anne thompson street by seen on both of those inspections and coordinating or synchronized no signals we can improve traffic movement through that intersection the report also make some recommendations about some clear way conditions particularly in Mitchell Street fly straight and wheeler street and the most clear agent issues might be required at certain times of the day for relatively short periods are probably only on one side of those roads what Woodrow would benefit from change parking arrangements within the next ten years of council engineers have determined that a similar flee away approach may be appropriate certain times of the day for Lockwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the traffic works report are estimated to cost in the vicinity of 2.5 million dollars the moderate priority works that out that comes through report enter our own engineers are astonished the Lockwood wrote a little highway intersection which carry them operates satisfactorily weird little perform poorly within 10 years and we determined that it would be a high priority a wide on the highway to allow for left for a left turn lane into Lockwood road to improve traffic flows we 've also recommended the three other treatments be done two roads in the area in particular all duty round of mutual street at that intersection we 're recommending the installation of traffic lights linked with these eschatology zero wheeler street signals you 'll be aware at a moment that traffic coming from the north shoots down wheel straight and then cuts across urology rolling down into mutual stream and vice versa turning the other way and only one of those intersections is signaled at the moment I 'll do he wrote an awkward road where suggestion we need to widen the pavement on the southeast corner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will street adjacent to the side yards the installation of traffic signals and modifications to that intersection would improve traffic flows area particularly if we were to synchronize those traffic signals with the recommended upgrade to the horton street we new hero developed opera road for any road intersection again proposing here we go through that area you 'll notice a particular end of the sales own truck speeding back dr. wheeler street quite away and because of the roundabout situation just down the road that because there 's cars constantly coming down you do to your own it 's quite difficult for the large trucks to get out into the road to make to make you turn so a signal approach to everything will give the opportunity for breaks in the traffic and to allow the heavy vehicles together and then at other times of the day when we don 't have to have you we can allow the traffic signals to allow traffic to flow through there the estimated cost of works to address these moderate priority items is about not point eight million dollars so all up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd identified directly out of the traffic works report and the package of other measures that our engineers are recommending we 're looking at about a 3.3 million dollar package of works and we are already in detail negotiations with the state and federal governments over on councils existing plans for an upgrade of oltorf erode you 'll be aware that class has already done some work in all duty road of light out as far as weel street and for some time that 's my own capital works list and we 've been in discussions with the government over extending those words from wheeler street all the way out to totals room","(-36.3779777,

VIC 3460, Australia",1183,so this is the clonestown all stage a remedial works project that hepburn shire council 's done in collaboration with funding from idb this project 's been ongoing for quite some time and been developed for a number of years and i 'm really pleased to be able to unleash it on clones again the revitalized town hall from the 1870s such an iconic building for the township but also quite well known throughout victoria um perhaps even australia so i 'll take you inside and show you around a few bits and pieces and let you know what 's happened and hopefully inform a few people about what 's what 's been happening here so come in so stephanie here those are the borough offices these these eventually untouched from back in the day um this is where a lot of the towns um uh clerks and um a lot of the internal workings of the the local shire occurred so this room was had quite a bit of work done to it a lot of cracking fixed up in the walls all our solar plaster reinstated and repainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can see it 's it 's looking like it was back in its original grand jury here this is the hallway and the archways were effectively rebuilt um all the original um original shapes and and moldings um in some places replaced and reset rerun and the ceiling 's replaced in here a lot of the walls have been patched and rendered and the paintwork reinstated as original its original color anyone who 's been to queenstown hall would most likely remember it for its main hall and it 's um it 's amazing features and a lot of history is evident based around what you see on the walls and it 's a very iconic and special room which many generations have really lived in and enjoyed and it 's great that it 's still in use today by the local community so this room is upstairs at the cloons town hall and effectively was turned into a projector room at some stage when film came along so it 's also called a bio room um so the room 's really you know it shows a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls people who would have worked up here running the projectors have written messages and dates and um different pieces of um art and so forth on the walls and the architects uh was fairly adamant that we retained a lot of the a lot of the original inscriptions and we 've done the best the builder 's done the best he can to to keep a lot of that although large part of this wall was severely damaged you could put your hand through the wall to the outside in some places in some of the cracks so effectively this wall was completely rebuilt and rear-ended the ceilings were um lava and plastered all over again um and you basically left with what you 've got today which is still remarkably original in its own right and um the girls have done a great job in bringing it back to life so this is the courthouse of the queen 's town hall so this work that we 've done here was additional to the original scope of stage a which was the main building and the buyer offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over on this side of the room it went all the way to the ceiling and carried on right through this part of the building on this wall as well so the front of the building tilted forwards and the cracking occurred on these parts they effectively let go in these areas so this wall here was the bricks were the wall was partially demolished and rebuilt in sections it had stitching um through some of the mortar and everything was rebuilt as per the specification that was given us from the architect for the rest of the building so um the barristers room over here had a bit of work done to it this whole wall is removed there 's a large crack above the doorway which was rebuilt this window was pulled out and a lot of the ceilings were replaced and as you can see it sort of looks like it did back in the day back in the 1800s and 1900s so this room here wasn 't part of the works required um but it 's an interesting room nonetheless it 's the holding cell where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's broken the law he 's on trial used to be held and um just before they were on trial i 'd be in a cage here brought in from this back door and we 're held here and then we had to plead their case out on the dock out here um and this little doorway here this little window is where the barracks used to communicate and of course that 's the barristers room so used to speak through a hatch through there this room is fairly untouched it 's all built at basel and it 's um yeah it 's fairly robust the reason the town hall 's had all this work done to it effectively is because the building was rotating forwards at the front due to uh issues with the foundations foundations dried out a number of years ago subsequently the building started cracking and letting go and this section of the building was the worst affected it was rotating forwards quite severely here the building was underpinned back in 2017 the building was stabilized and monitoring occurred for a year or so um it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstruct which is this stage a project that 's going forward a lot of work was done to the roof to prevent any water getting in that was leaking through quite a lot of the building at the front here due to their movement um and also some of the box gutters and slates had shifted um over time so a lot of time was spent by the builder replacing or re-fixing um slate work a lot of the lead was um was very fixed the box gutters were replaced with stainless steel in a lot of sections the a lot of the steel work was um was de-rusted and descaled and repainted chimneys had quite a bit of work above the clock tower there yeah a lot of the features you see over the archways were re-pointed and they 're called um this was so they were done by hand some of them rebuilt completely as i mentioned with the archway at the corner and yeah really a hell of a lot of work went into the front of this building you,"(-37.3429596, 144.1421634)"

events this the first time though i 've encountered an event where there are lots of trees lying around that nobody 's got responsibility for [Music] and every time something happens that doesn 't fit into the predicted uh framework of government of course there 's a massive problem um who 's going to deal with it and it 's often these things which define the particular character of the recovery process how efficiently it happens and how long it takes and and who does it and what i notice over the years is there is a certain way in which every disaster is the same it doesn 't matter what the initial event is everyone involved is going to be in for a long hard grind whether it 's a couple of years or often it 's uh five or ten years i have to say and the 10th anniversary of black saturday there was still a significant number of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of exceptions so that people could live in their sheds something that i 'm sure you know is not permitted is it but they made particular uh time limited exceptions but when the 10 year came there are a whole bunch of people who are still living in their shed so there 's a whole lot of new arrangements needed to be made and you know people 's lives as you all know are very complicated aren 't they we 've already got very complicated lives we 've already got lots of problems and then you throw all these trees on top of it so you get you know just unimaginable complexities it 's the complexity of the of the human situation encountering the the natural in disaster encountering the government arrangements so that 's got a particular character which is unique for each disaster but there are the basic situations the same it doesn 't matter what it is and i 'm going to speak in a minute about the impact on ourselves the the stress response and the experiences we have that we have to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the really important time it 's not what happened back there in was it june or july june it 's what 's going to happen for the next six months and then maybe the next year uh that 's the crucial time let me give you a very simple story um when i uh worked in uh the ash wednesday fires i was part of a children 's hospital team working with families in the macedon area and there was a particular family that had a couple of kids and they sought our help or the their kids had anxieties as you 'd expect and we had a couple of sessions and everything was all right five years later the father of this family looked me up in the phone book remember when we used our phone books and he made an appointment and came to see me and what he described was the following he 'd built this house himself out of mud bricks had a few acres with horses and lovely lifestyle it all burned to the ground he just managed to get out his wife was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just managed to get the kids and get out nothing nothing else he comes back a few days later and he 's sifting through the ruins and his neighbour comes across and says yeah i 'm so sorry i lost my house too what are you going to do and he said well i 'm going to rebuild of course what else can i do and so his neighbor says i 'll help you he said thanks so for the next six months the two of them spent every waking minute that they weren 't at their jobs earning their living up on the block rebuilding and at six months he got it to lock up stage and so they all moved in and his neighbor comes across and says it 's fantastic you 're in isn 't that wonderful and he he says yes thanks so much for all your help and the neighbor says i 'm going to start mine now so he he 's never experienced such a sense of obligation so for the next six months he helps the neighbor so that 's one year gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've sold everything and he 's living in a flat near the essendon airport seeing his kids every second weekend and when he comes to my rooms he says i don 't understand what happened i thought we had a good marriage but i 've lost everything now the loss of the house is a reversible loss isn 't it it 's difficult and painful and distressing and at the time you can 't see your way through but in a few years you 'll be living somewhere with a roof won 't you but the loss of your marriage and your family is irreversible you know he could remarry and have a nice family again but he 's lost that one and that 's irreversible now what i want to emphasize is that the real problem with disasters are those irreversible losses they might be a marriage it might be your health it might be your relationships with your families because a lot sorry with your neighbors because a lot of tensions and stresses in the you know the disasters are random and this puts a lot of stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent and according to criteria but actually we can 't get our heads around those criteria and so we often don 't understand why somebody was entitled to something but i didn 't get it and that creates a lot of emotion and if we 're on a good day and very calm and rational we can process that but we 're not and so we 're angry and upset we say things maybe not directly but in the rumor mill do you have one of those up here and it gets back and they 're deeply offended and hurt and long-term relationships break down because the differences of impact of the disaster and the government arrangements and so on are are arbitrary in terms of the relationship so they arbitrarily cut across friendships and and other relationships and uh and and fracture if we 're not careful fracture the community i call them cleavage planes i noticed those already in in macedon and then saw them in one event after another and i remembered from my high school uh natural science uh you know that diamonds are very hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crystal structure where the molecular bonds are weak and if you hit it there you can split it you can cut diamonds following those planes well the the cleavage planes in the community will be there could be pre-existing cleavage planes you might have people up here that barrack for collingwood for example and there 'll be a cleavage plane between them and the other members of the community but there 'll be cleavage planes according to the circumstances who was here and who wasn 't who 's insured and who 's not who has had physical damage and who did on their houses and who hasn 't you know it could could be anything and what we see is as time goes by if we 're not very careful to actually remember we 're all in this together we all need each other then this fracturing starts to take place theoretically it 's unnecessary but it always happens and so i think it 's most important to have a way of getting together and getting beyond that and helping each other so there 's been um it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united states not all professors i find are useful this man had the perfect start to his disaster career he moved into a new job in new orleans about a month before hurricane katrina he had no idea what disasters were he was a professor of political science so when they were told to evacuate he just took his family and went over the state border and had a nice weekend with some friends and his house flooded to the rafters he said he didn 't even take his computer what kind of a professor is he so he lost all the previous research everything he had done up to that point but he got interested in disasters and he 's done some really interesting research because he 's able to sort of take in all these huge quantities of data he came here and and gave a presentation at the state library some years ago and he started off by showing a huge great big overhead of uh a map of new orleans and he 'd done a project where they i think they interviewed two thousand people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map where they lived and color coded according to how severely they felt they 'd been affected by this disaster and then the background was shaded according to the depth of water all right can you picture that they 're all over new orleans and you 've got the depth of water and he starts off his presentation saying to this audience what 's the relationship between the severity of impact and the depth of water and everyone looks and looks and looks and looks and finally somebody said there 's no relationship he said that 's right there 's no relationship now i thought thank god for that now somebody has proved statistically what uh we who work in this area have known for many years the problem is that when you 've had massive physical damage you can 't help thinking you 're worse off because you feel you are badly up and you are badly off but we don 't understand the complexity of life of of of other people 's circumstances the beyond bushfire research that melbourne university has done since black saturday it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done on long-term effects i think they 've done a 10-year follow-up three years five years 10 years what i found is that one of the best predictors strongest predictors about how people 's mental health is certainly at the five-year mark is whether they had any degree of separation from their loved ones at the time of the fire just separation they just didn 't know where they were or didn 't know for maybe 24 hours whether they had made it or not and i 'm going to talk about trauma in a minute but this a very traumatic situation now you could go through that fire and be untouched uh but you could have thought for 24 hours you 'd lost your loved ones that 's a massive and irreversible change in your experience of life isn 't it and some people will cope with that much better than others depending on their life history and so on so that 's just one example of an invisible factor that you wouldn 't know about unless you really sit down with people and go through their story you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community meeting it was in the maryborough racing club i get to see some really interesting places uh and there was this uh from one of the little nearby towns had been badly flooded and these people were sitting in in like this except they 're all cuddled up we can 't do that anymore and i was talking about the effects and i noticed a woman sitting about three rows back who was looking really sad very attentive but very sad and you know as i was talking towards the end of it she put up a hand and said is it right that some people who weren 't actually flooded might feel badly affected and i said yes yes and i forget what i said but i said some relevant things and she said oh thank you very much we were a little bit affected our shed was flooded now behind her was another woman and when she said my shed was flooded she rolled her eyes oh you poor thing your shed was i 'm so sorry for you and you could see how it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected lost all your furniture but because this woman looked so sad and i saw this eye roll behind her i said we can 't let that go so i just said to her what do you keep in your shed and she said all the heirlooms from my mother 's estate she died a couple of months before the floods so you see she 's lost history and identity hasn 't she that 's irreplaceable now their eye rolling lady might have lost some beautiful furniture that could be well insured she just didn 't orders another lot after a lot of pallava of course but can you see what i mean now she 's very upset because she 's you know she 's lost a lot of stuff but this other lady has lost something that can 't be replaced so these are just little examples now what i want to emphasize is that i think there are three problems with disasters the first one is trauma which is the bad experience we have on the day which can reverberate for a very long time second one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment uh i actually live in the yarra valley and where i live just outside yarra glen was completely surrounded by fire i could stand on the hill at the back of my place and i could watch the spot fires starting about five or six kilometers on the other side of town and i could see it coming down over the christmas hills and it you know got completely dark at five o 'clock completely dark like midnight for about half an hour and the closer it gets the less idea you have now i 've heard a couple of descriptions i 've done some work with the people in the dandenongs and kalorama i 've had a few descriptions of what it was like on that night and and you know i bet you had a lot of darkness then too you know each that that that actual quality of the of the impact is quite different according to the physical circumstances but but um you know it 's taken about uh i would say six to eight years for uh the physical impact on the surrounding hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't see this bushland that was so beautiful before which is just sticks and uh jagged you know outlines and so on it 's sort of coming back quite nicely now and so you get this constant impact back from the environment that that you 're in that that keeps you confronted with what 's happened and so there 's a loss involved in that and you know we have all the other losses and i want to come to los again in a minute but the third one is the effect that it 's taken me the longest really to understand and that is disruption the disruption to our lives and i just want to speak about each of these three because uh we can if we understand these three we can help ourselves and each other i gave a talk at a psychological society conference on trauma um and they were presenting all that all the studies and research and so on and but i gave my talk on the 80 of affected people who don 't see psychologists how do they actually process their trauma well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one outside the area understands do they you find that you try to tell your neighbours and so your friends and relatives down in melbourne they don 't get it and their time frame for recovery is very unrealistic and so it 's it 's the community needing to talk together and share experiences and and help each other through it that 's so important that 's why the cleavages are so damaging and uh what this professor has proved with huge studies comparing all of the japanese prefectures that were affected by the fukushima disaster and looking at all the places affected by the east asian tsunami and he 's done all these studies of detailed measures and he says the factor that most consistently and accurately predicts how fast and how complete the recovery is complete in a sense of how many people return to the area how quickly the economics get going and the whole community life gets going is not how much money is spent or what political influence communities have and they all have different degrees of influence and he measures all this it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money in the bank sitting there waiting so that when a tree falls on your house you just take some and you pay for it to be fixed that 's capital isn 't it or you want to buy a new car you just you just do it social capital is relationships with people so that you can ask for help you can get information you can ask somebody where you can find out about this you know and and just arrangements where people get together and work together it 's far more important than government assistance according to the measures and this is what you 're speaking about on the on the day this tremendous working together uh which i think often gives people a a unique experience so this social capital is the absolute uh most precious resource that we have and it 's very important for processing trauma now let me talk about trauma for a moment i better put my watch here because i noticed that clock has stopped that 's could take a fair while to come around so the word trauma means wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical care of people who 've been run over by a bus as opposed to having a heart attack or a attack of diabetes or something like that externally caused injuries so for me a psychological trauma is an experience that 's so intense is it damages my ability to come to terms with it so that it appears to be reactivated and all the emotions come back every time the wind blows or any other sensory experience associated with it we we go into this we call it a state of heightened arousal adrenaline uh anxiety running around doing things and that means we have an experience that psychologists call intrusive re-experiencing as opposed to memory memory would be wow that 's windy oh that reminds me of that uh that storm we had back in uh july june sorry june oh yeah i reminds me it 's the same sort of whistling sound that 's memory because you 're remembering something in the past the traumatic re-experiencing is oh my god is something going to fall on us now i 'm getting out of here because i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-experiencing what it was like at the time and i 'm very disturbed now now that means you open up the injury don 't you you go back there you feel the same feelings again you know remember when you were young and you sprained your ankle in netball or football or something and then you keep spraining it you keep spraining it and you get these chronic injuries because you didn 't do what your mother said stay home is that different to a panic attack yeah yeah because the panic attack is an is an episode of anxiety that doesn 't have to be connected to anything right we can have panic just feel very anxious and not know where it 's coming from the anxiety will be part of the traumatic re-experiencing but that 'll be tied to something that links us to the experience and we start to experience it again so uh now this is a very interesting thing that uh people who go through traumas don 't feel safe again in particular kinds of circumstances so when we ask what is injured what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put them away into memory which also includes learning from them when people have traumatic stress they don 't learn from the experience they just keep going through it now when this happens we 've got to identify the damage now the damage is to the assumptions we have about the world ourselves other people nature the assumptions now assumptions we don 't know what our assumptions are because they 're assumed the assumptions are built up by the repeated experiences of everything being the same every day and so you don 't need to pay any attention to it and we now know that those habits and assumptions are processed in a very deep part of the brain automatically without any attention right so our assumptions are that we live in a nice safe environment and in fact we don 't even have that much problem with bushfires up here do you yet yeah right so uh so your assumptions are built up on everyday experience um now i can illustrate this with a woman i worked with who is going to cross the road at a you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shopping center and when the lights changed for the traffic to go somebody on the other side of the road took off at great speed did a right angle turn across the traffic and rammed in to the traffic light she was standing next to which fell on her neck and luckily the local gp was standing beside her waiting to go across and get his lunch and so when she came to he had his hands clamped tightly around her neck and said don 't move and as a result she 's not a quadriplegic she 's recovered very well but she could well have been now can you imagine that this woman for a long time regarded as absolutely irresponsible and dangerous to walk down the footpath of a four-lane suburban road with her kids why would you put your kids at such danger and there would be other people who would say that 's a perfectly safe thing to do i wouldn 't even think about it because this this car behaved in a completely unpredicted way now i 've done some work with this lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will say well that probably explains everything but but you know we knew each other pretty well and i said what you really need to do is you need to take a deck chair out on the main road in front of my rooms and sit there for a whole day watching the traffic go past you know all in their lanes all more or less in the speed limit all taking care of each other and watch it for hour after hour after hour because that 's how you formed your initial assumption and when the traumatic event happens it shatters that assumption irreversibly you know because something has happened that i never believed would happen and once it 's happened it could happen again it could happen next time this car might be going to do it it might happen any time i 'm not i 'm not safe i 'm not going there uh do you see that 's the anxiety anxiety is contained by security predictability and so on and so the danger with the trauma of an event like this is that we shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every time the wind blows i think i might be going to die right that 's then creating a post-traumatic stress situation where you just don 't feel safe and i know some of the people who live in the dandenongs i was told were saying i 'm not sure i want to live here anymore i thought it was a beautiful place i think i want to go down i know people who moved out of the area where i live right down into somewhere like camberwell or something where they 're completely away from fires and they had beautiful environment they don 't feel safe so that assumption is shattered now what we have to do is we have to learn to actually rebuild our assumptions how do we rebuild the assumptions in the same way in which they are built up the first place by the repeated experiences of things being the way they are unless we have too much climate change uh but can you see that therefore it 's absolutely inevitable that you have to be ready to work through a few windy winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i don 't know what what they rate it as you know 100 or something is it so so uh whatever that means in terms of our experience but but do you see that you we 've got to be prepared but we must work constructively with these experiences so that we will rebuild healthy assumptions that we can live with rather than being sort of closed in to a dangerous little narrow space where we never feel comfortable as long as the wind blows and so there 's a lot of work to be done which means we 've got to think about what 's happened we 've got to understand wind speeds i know in christchurch they got very very good at being able to guess the you know the the size of the earthquake they 'd stop and i think this will be a 3.6 i 'd say maybe 3.7 that 's all right well this is a bigger one this must be a five uh you know so they 're actually learning to read and then towards the end of the time when they weren 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling they say is that a truck or is it an earthquake is that a truck or an earthquake a truck it 's a truck it 's okay it 's a truck so they started to discriminate the different kinds of vibrations so they 're working to rebuild the sense of safety and this is something we have to do now there 's something that gets into the way of that and that is a property of the way our minds work when we 're in danger now once we experience any kind of threat take a simple example do you have snakes up here think of the last time you nearly trot on a snake i nearly trot on a copperhead snake about two weeks ago i didn 't think it would be there and suddenly it reels out from under my feet in and i made such a guttural uh sort of noise that my two-year-old grandson beside me just laughed his head off he didn 't see that he just think what 's grandpa making this strange noise for but you know this it comes from deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you you know you find yourself levitating backwards at a great rate because that kind of immediate experience just converts into action to resolve it that 's the difference with anxiety by the way fear is fear of of something that 's here and therefore translates immediately into some kind of action anxiety is fear about something that might happen and you can 't do anything about it because it hasn 't happened yet so i feel really helpless and it 's a very unbearable feeling uh and that 's a part of what comes up when when we start to get this re-experiencing is this wind going to be this that or the other now the what enables us in that state to be so effective is that a whole series of changes happen in our brain and in our mind driven by predominantly adrenaline and there are several main ones first of all we get a narrowing and tunnelling of attention onto the problem that 's useful listener because we don 't get distracted we just focus on the snake or we just focus on the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut down our own uh emotions by and large so that we we translate into action and people say they didn 't have any feelings at the time they were just they 're in a very heightened state but they 're just doing things the reactions come afterwards if you 've ever been in a near mess in the car for instance you 'd think you 'd be frightened but you haven 't got time to be frightened it also focuses our mind on in the right side of our brain where we process information about the physical world as we can see it the sensory motor world the movement and and perceptions because that 's what 's going to save us from a snake or a charging bull or or even a bush fire coming isn 't it it coming how fast do i have to move where is it going to go next it 's all about that so actually we come really focused down on the pure physical environment and the other thing it does is it makes us egocentric right because survival is about my survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a reasonably civilized human being i 'll probably help them too but the research shows that people do much the same most people do much the same whether it 's their nearest and dearest or someone they 've never seen before if there 's a physical opportunity to help them they help them so that we like to and we 've all been um uh you know confused by hollywood movies where the hero and the heroine you know and all that sort of stuff and they the hero runs towards the heroine against all the crowds that are running away and all that sort of stuff that 's not actually what uh real behavior is like it 's predominantly being a hero comes down to having a physical opportunity not everyone will do it but most people will do it if they can they 'll help each other that 's because they 're another human being and in that moment you 're in a very uh sort of focused state of mind down to the bare bones of human existence it 's a really profound experience and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear sense of the whole unfolding of the event but you get what uh the psychologists call flash bulb memories those flashes you would know that from uh you know having some near-miss in the car and as you sort of get through it and you go go to bed that night you just have these flashes because we don 't have the we now know we don 't have the processing power in that state to put everything together so we end up with fragments and the fragments will be the most dangerous moments won 't they because they 're going to be most strongly imprinted in their minds so can you see that if you just sit with those fragments you set up loops of post-traumatic intrusive re-experiencing you see how that follows which is why it 's terribly important for people like red cross to come and see people afterwards and and help them just settle down and start putting it all together but we won 't put it all together in the in the early stages because we we just can 't remember it all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed is that people who don 't have a lot of other problems you know some people will be very traumatized straight away and really need some help i was actually talking to a couple of councillors from an agency that deals with traumatized people and one of the counselors talked about a young woman who 'd had a very traumatic experience and she 'd had it about 10 days before and she was really struggling and she came straight the other one the person that had a very traumatic and tragic experience and he was an older person and he hadn 't come for some months and when he did come his priority was how does he look after his family and he doesn 't want to address his trauma because he 's got more important things to do now this is a really important principle because if we can we put our trauma aside and deal with more important things like talking to the insurance company of you know clearing the debris and doing all the things that enable us to re-activate our lives because of the chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors to look after and so on so so healthy people have a capacity to put a certain amount of trauma aside without doing anything to it so it 's just put aside and then what happens now it 's highly loaded traumatic experience maybe people thought they might be going to die i 've certainly heard stories of and and spoken to people from the dandenongs and heard stories up here that uh sound to me like uh if i was in that situation i 'd be thinking that maybe i 'm not gonna make it these are really important experiences but you 've got so much to do afterwards you 've just got to put it aside and it 's part of our self-respect to get control put our emotions aside and deal with things so what you get then is people 's trauma coming up for processing at all sorts of different times what the uh beyond bushfires people have shown something that we 've known for a long time is there 's a sort of a graph where the the people the number of people wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's usually a peak very early on and then there 's another peak around about six months right about now and then the anniversary and then 18 months i was at a conference in the u.s where i saw the statistics from the new york uh counseling service after september 11 and when they presented their statistics of referrals is exactly that loop it 's not just a matter of natural disasters because i think it has to do with the the need for people to get on with their lives if we can 't get on with our lives the whole thing becomes dysfunctional doesn 't it things just don 't work so it 's a very big priority for us and in order to do that we put aside our experience now because i was giving this presentation to the psychologist because i wanted them i basically want them to get out of their offices and mingle with community members and have informal chats with them and they 'll be able to do a lot of work that they won 't get to do otherwise and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what i communicated to them was a huge study that was done in the u.s across the whole u.s they sampled all sorts of people who had traumas all sorts of different traumas and they found that the average time after the trauma that people actually went and sought help was 12 years right terrible traumatic events now we know that that 's i remember a woman who worked with us veterans came out a few years ago had lunch with her with other people and she said they 'd done a big study in the average time that discharged military personnel come forward and ask for uh help from their trauma is 10 years what 's what 's what 's everyone doing during this time when they 've had horrible experiences they shut it down that takes energy takes emotional energy we all know what it 's like to carry a worry around don 't we and you 're more likely to be short-tempered and irritable because you 've got things on your mind you can 't concentrate so well you don 't enjoy stuff as much you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last couple of weeks people are feeling like that because covert has cut across their processing now when they look at this curve they find that yes the curve is there if you look at the whole population but if you look at who 's doing what you 'll find that each curve involves different people if you just have the number of referrals that means i need it straight away you need it in six months you needed in 12 months you needed 18 months because our circumstances all different and there 'll be people who we know from bushfires aren 't ready to process their trauma until they 've they 've moved into their new house they 've got everything settled and then everyone thinks oh you lucky person i wish i had a new house you 're over it but they 're not over it this is when they start to agree for what they 've lost and have their trauma waking them up at night with fear and so i think it 's important to remember this and to realize that uh we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their trauma come up at all sorts of different times quite unexpectedly or maybe something trivial you know maybe you have a little bit of a fright in the car or something and suddenly it brings back the issue of of survival now i want to say a couple of things about how we can work with this because when people tell the story if you listen to them spontaneously they will tell a story up until the most dangerous moment and then they 'll break the narrative sequence the story unfolding i can give an example of this i kept being told when i first went down to malakuta about this young man who 'd um got all the gear and he he went out behind his house to protect the house as the fire came out of the bush and they had a fire break and what i kept being told was that when the fire came out it was so huge that he realized there was absolutely nothing he could do and he thought he was going to be killed and they said to me you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said he was very traumatized because he thought he was going to die now what are you wondering about they didn 't tell me he was dead was he otherwise they wouldn 't know what he thought he 's alive are you wondering how come he lived when he thought he was going to die well that 's what we should wonder you see because he lived now all we know is the traumatic bit of the experience when he thought he was going to die and that 's what we will find people will tell us when they talk to us about their experience on the night because that 's the most dramatic that 's imprinted in the trauma part of our brain if you like and the thing we have to understand is that now once you 've got that and you keep telling that bit of the story and usually they break out of the story and go into the emotions and i bet if i talk to him he would say something like i 've never seen anything like it i didn 't believe there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gonna die and then he 'd probably say delp should have done more burning off it 's it 's this person 's and the cfa should have come and i don 't know what they 're doing and he all of his traumatic emotion would convert into anger and frustration about somebody should have stopped this from happening uh can you see what 's happening now that will then just create a helpless bundle of emotion now every time something triggers a connection with anything in that sequence building up to that moment it 's going to go around in a loop isn 't it it 's going to go round and round in a loop anger helplessness frustration settle down remind around and again now that 's a post-traumatic loop and the more we think about it in that way and that means we get caught up in the frustrations and i don 't know what it 's like up here but most people after disasters have a lot of frustrations and anger with a lot of what they feel to be incompetence and inconsistency in government and lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to do and they never never ever do them fast enough right because we 're all in this narrowed egocentric focus i need this and i need it now why can 't i have it it 's we can 't stretch our mind around how complex this is so we 've got this sort of background of high emotion anyway so when we go around these loops we 're actually building a post-traumatic loop and they 've now been able to show with the brain scans how people who 've got strong post trauma and have a particular circuit in their brain that keeps getting reactivated by this they can follow it all through now here 's something we can do you listen to each other it could be your partner you could even listen to yourself telling a story about it or you could listen to a neighbour or someone you meet over a cup of tea here and listen to their story now here 's what you can do is when they get to the point of greatest danger just see where they go they 'll often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite some empathy and understanding by all means give it well that 's terrible that must have been awful experience but here 's the next question you ask because if you don 't hold where you want to go they 'll suck you into their emotional loop this should have happened and somebody did this and you know what you have to simply say is what happened next that 's all what happened next so when i was talking to this young firefighter he said when he describes the most disturbing bit and says i thought i was going to die and i 'm thinking he 's standing here he must have survived somehow so i want to find out because it 's not in his memory loop is it so every time he remembers this he 's not going to remember how he survived he 's only going to remember how he nearly died so therefore he 's going to behave as though he died not quite but nearly right so if i ask him what happened next don 't ask him how he feels that 'll take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible thing happened but if you ask him what happened next he 'll have to tell you won 't he and what you 'll see is that often people suddenly you 've asked them an unexpected question and you can see they so look and you can see they 've got to go somewhere else in their mind to a different memory system which is a memory system for reassuring information as opposed to threatening information they go into different memory systems the scientists are gradually working this out but you can actually see it they look and they say oh uh well i i put the hose over me i ran around the building or i did this i realized that i couldn 't fight the fire and so i thought i 've got to get out of here and you could say to them that was a good judgment what made you so clear that this is what you should have done i 'll give you another short example i was in kangaroo island just after the fires in south australia and afterwards a woman came to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i nearly cost uh my daughter and and me our lives and they came and told me to evacuate because the fire was sort of around there coming and going for a number of days the fire went past her house and went back again and then she was told you should evacuate she said well it 's been here i think we 'll be all right and she didn 't evacuate she and her daughter and then she saw it coming and she thought this is very dangerous uh she thought of evacuating to the other end of the island she thought i think it 's going to be too dangerous down that road i 'll go to the hillside that was burned a few days before that 'll probably be all right so she reasonable inexperienced but maybe reasonable sort of idea uh uh yeah i know i 'm listening to it looking at the faces uh she drives to that hillside with her daughter this is what she 's telling me and i looked around and i realized it 's not safe this is not a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so she 's actually recognized the danger isn 't hasn 't she that 's a really good thing she 's clear enough this is not a good place to be and then she said i didn 't know what to do next and so i asked my question so what happened next well my daughter said shouldn 't we try and go to the other end of the island and [Applause] you know it 's the only option isn 't it so a daughter comes out and she 's all right and then she describes in detail how she drives onto the road gets herself right across the the white line and crawls along in the smoke until it clears then she flattens it as fast she can until she hits the next smoke bank then she stops and crawls along keeps in the middle of flattens it and so on and in that way it gets out now actually two people died on that same road but she made it and she isn 't she driving well for the circumstances uh trying to get there fast but being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives in danger before she made a bad decision not to evacuate but she also made a well i 'll say an inexperienced decision and going to the hillside but then she made a good decision to realise it wasn 't the right but she didn 't actually come up with the idea so she 's left feeling a failure and i said to her what would have happened if your daughter hadn 't suggested that what do you reckon would have happened it 's the only option she would have come up with it how long do you think it would have taken you 10 seconds it would feel like 10 years but you know and so so what i was able to show her is that now she 's got these fragments and the fragments she remembers is her helplessness her bad decisions and then her sense of helplessness and then her daughter answers the question and she has no sense of her own competence but it 's all there inside if her daughter hadn 't said it they would have worked it out together somehow can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that 's what you 've got to remember not those fragments but that somehow between you you and your daughter muddled through and saved yourselves what more can we ask i said i bet on the next fire you 'll do a better job right because that 'll be experience okay because this is why people are so inexperienced so so this is something you can do with each other just try to get the story complete and take it through until people are safe again that 's the the unit of memory that we have to hang on to and if people keep processing that you 'll have to go through it a number of times to to actually put it together then i think it 's how we gradually put it in the past and are able to say yeah i remember we had a horrible storm back in 2021 now i want to say a couple of words about grief grief and loss whatever we lose one of the key things about loss is we lose something that is emotionally significant to us and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be the bush land uh it could be animals it could be neighbors it could be anything and i think what 's really important is to realize that when we do lose some something important it 's very hard for us to accept it there 's some and it 's that to do with that deep part of us that 's based on assumptions and habits uh that things are always like this i always love this bush it 's gone and i feel i can 't accept it and anyone who 's been through serious grief will know takes a long time to accept the loss and once you 've accepted the loss you can start to process it and and and and then think about how how can i have my life now in the future and rebuild the life around the fact that what you lost is not there but there are a lot of other things there and this is slow and painful work but i think one of the things that 's really important that comes up which we 're not always clear about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right if you if you build a house you live in a beautiful block and you look at it every day that bit of nature is a part of you and we link ourselves this is you could say the western uh version of what indigenous people talk about as being owned by the land we don 't own the land the land owns us is what they say and this sense of identity that they have very much in the foreground we have it i think when when people attach themselves to a place but it 's in the background we don 't have a very good language about talking about this and i think it 's very important to think that there will be an irreversible change and you know if you go to places like macedon and cockatoo where black saturday devastated you 'll see there 's a beautiful environment again it 's probably not the same but it will be beautiful and we have to be patient and then understand that we have to actually accept that and ask ourselves how do we have a creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something that we go back and forth from in the process and one of the things that comes up and it 's part of this state of being living in a disrupted lifestyle where we get preoccupied with all the immediate problems we have to engage in that that we have to recognize that uh we need to be aware of hanging on to the important values in our life what 's our life really about what is important because when you 're in that highly stressed state you haven 't got space or in your mind to think about that you 're on the here and now immediate problems and so what often happens down the track is if people haven 't been stopping and thinking about uh what does this mean for their lives their life plan their community their their sense of self what 's important to them all of these things are liable to be influenced if they haven 't got an environment where they can think and talk about this they suddenly get out the other end and they say i don 't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore where do you want to live i don 't know it doesn 't really matter and and there are some people that come out of disasters with a sort of an aimless loss of of focus and this is what we call identity now we can work with this by processing what it means uh in our informal conversations listening to each other having someone interested makes me find words for vague feelings this is very important stuff it 's more important for the long-term future than how fast the problem of the trees gets solved that 's about trees this is about self relationships family community so and and to say if we don 't get too deeply into the stress we do give attention to these things in the stress state we can 't think of these broad issues we get focused on the physical here and now and we can 't afford to neglect these big issues for too long or we lose our direction and uh how do we hang on to it well we have to keep stepping out of the stress which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our quality of life and our relationships and our long-term goals not the damned trees and who should be doing what and things like that that 'll all get gradually sorted out but it 'll take a long time so uh how do we actually get out of the stress very simple recipe pleasure and leisure don 't be ridiculous you 'll say to me we haven 't got time for that sort of nonsense don 't you realize we 've you know now you can 't afford not to because it 's no good fixing your place up and they 're not enjoying living there is it or being unwell or being sick i mean or having relationship problems and so on pleasure means i restore energy because i 'm doing something i enjoy that gives me satisfaction that makes my life meaningful leisure is i don 't have to do anything don 't be ridiculous i 've got all this work to do no you can set aside sunday afternoon why won 't i know what to do with myself well run around run around the block a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you 'll tune into yourself if you carve out that leisure time and if you enjoyed sunday afternoon maybe try saturday afternoon as well and maybe wednesday evening try to build a routine where you recapture some of this leisure time because that 's where the deeper processing goes on where our mind can free wheel and sort of bed all this down and let it fade into the past while we hang on to what 's really important in our lives we had a i 'll stop with this story we had a meeting in king lake about four years after black saturday there was then a lot of community angst and division and stress and we had this very turbulent meeting where people were totally focused on all the physical problems and so there was some you know a lot of them were sort of listened to and dealt with and then i was asked to say a few words about this sort of stuff i 'd already talked about it you know various times up there and then there was a bit of a discussion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are but actually i 'm enjoying decorating my new house i never thought i 'd ever have a new house to decorate it 's a lovely experience and i 've been really enjoying it and last saturday i did this that and the other she described and i sat down and had a cup of tea and then i thought to myself now what were the goals of my life before black saturday and then she just said in a wistful voice but i couldn 't remember you know she 's lost a connection now if if you stay stressed for too long you start asking what am i doing this for don 't we it 's absolutely predictable if you just don 't have any time out you start to you keep doing it but you just you 're not your heart 's not in so pleasure and leisure and that 's quality of life and that 's what the man from macedon didn 't do he thought the priority was to rebuild his house but it wasn 't it was to look after his marriage and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't matter if he 'd rebuild his house over two years or five years in ten years time he would have still had a family wouldn 't he and i think that 's the perspective we have to preserve and try and and just work out how you can keep living during this very very frustrating few years sorry i 've gone on for a long time here but uh i don 't don 't know if anyone 's got any questions [Music] you,"(-37.3429596, 144.1421634)"

of service the sacrifice and the suffering of those who fought in conflicts and and so that we could come after can remember and acknowledge those lives through those whose lives were lost recently avenues of honor were expanded to include commemorative trees and so we 're fortunate enough to have several avenues at dallsford dean drummond kingston and a commemorative train at floyd 's that we come together today on the traditional lands of the judge run to acknowledge and commemorate the australian frontier wars this is a term that 's been required by some historians to describe the violent conflicts that occurred between aboriginal people and white settlers following the british colonisation of australia these conflicts occurred from january 1788 and the landing of the first fleet up until as late as 1934 and these conflicts occurred here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about these specific conflicts later in the morning from erica higgins this year the theme for reconciliation week earlier in the year was take action and the theme for naidoc week was hill country as i said in line with that it 's feeling that we wreath as we do on other occasions when we remember the lives lost and the sacrifices i want to acknowledge the courage that it takes for us to face the dark depths of history that we all share in the banshara this memorial cited here as it is in this magnificent standard monograms and located in close proximity to dalesville avenue of honor will be an ongoing acknowledgement of a reminder to those of us who live here now and for the generations to come that the judge will run the land 's traditional owners were subject to violence some were killed some were moved on and all were dispossessed in recognizing and honoring that suffering and loss in the same spirit that the community does in our other avenues of honor we acknowledge the hurt commit to truth telling say that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and work together towards

challenge and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm very fortunate to be the ceo of the jaja woodland group the people the corporate entity and to be able to be present and invited by hepburn to be able to talk today i 'd like to acknowledge my kin that are here today recognise them in particular if we think of ourselves as family and as community to extend that that warmth of friendship of uh relationship partnership and call out the significance of what happened shire and through your leadership uh councillors and the executive and management the people the community that live here to do something that is uh a first the significance and uniqueness of that cannot be underestimated i think to shout that loudly to the nation so others can hopefully follow in your stead uh uh for for calling out the truth i like the idea of the word um that 's used that is uh quaint as uh the settler society to be settled is a way that can define people being present for my ancestors and as our mayor has touched upon uh uh their backyard was settled if we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in and take responsibility for our backyards their mothers and fathers and our children those before us and uh in terms of the significance of this avenue the memorial uh that it now uh places uh in respect of the fallen of our people there will be others that go away from conversations that this avenue might bring forward and say no these things didn 't happen i would say that those people are yet to be mature in their thinking to be able to challenge themselves what it 's like for somebody to move into your backyard um the mana gum if i think culturally uh like all trees that drive their roots deep in the country is very symbolic of leadership presence and power of people culturally the mana gums that are here we would hope that we give them our own delcook multiple good spirit as people pass and think about the manner guns that it 's yard on waterfall that takes uh unwellness from those people and makes community better so i don 't think i can add any more than that and i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time out to be present here and sharing this really significant day that you should all be extremely proud of thank you thank you rodney and i think he said uh fantastically and you 're right um hopefully this really is as people are driving past the uh the thousands of people that will be driving past every day they take some time to uh uh consider where we 've been and where we 're going to uh can i now call on rodney and our mayor to lay the reef and also we 'll take an opportunity to obtain one minute to silence it 's a big day today um thank you today i acknowledge the traditional owners of the land the meeting on and their elders passed both today and those that will come in the future and i acknowledge their continuous connection to this land waters animals birds and plants that make this country quite a deaf cultural identity and i acknowledge indigenous people from other places that are here today i need to pay my respects also to someone who has been important in guiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country especially edgar morrison who wrote his books on the history of this area and played this by massacres murder and the forcible removal of the jaguar and others first off their lands onto the frankfurt protectorate and then to corondo this was written in the 60s when many believed judge iran were extinct and that the past was buried and forgotten i also need to acknowledge the work government cultural officer in the 90s to register places of cultural and historical significance who paved the way for the strength of georgia gay in having their custodians of the land 's research both of these men taught me that the history while we can now openly speak of this pain as part of our shared history we need to remind ourselves it did in fact happen to not only men who were warriors defending their land their rights their laws and their families this was also perpetrated on women in children this was a time when racism ruled and the laws of the christians who settled here were clearly flooded and they killed they killed innocent people because they represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Music] and about paranoias today we 've done something pivotal in our history in australia not just for our local rural community we formally acknowledged that the frontier wars had uncounted victims that the frontier wars continue to cause pain to the judge around and to those of us who 've tried to understand and emphasize so let 's not forget the judicial miners are with us to this day that we have a huge amount of work ahead of us together as part of our efforts towards truth-telling and healing today to paraphrase neil armstrong this is one small step that happens in one giant league for australia by acknowledging the wrongs and setting up a place for us to remember and reflect starting to walk together in a way that hasn 't happened before those beautiful trees are a symbol of what was here and survival beauty and endurance and it 's my hope that we 'll see more avenues of honor be planted or identified across our country both charge around the country and the lands of other traditional owners i hope that we can show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in pain that was inflicted and he still felt he 's still needing to be openly acknowledged he still needs to heal and there are many ways to heal and this is just a small step that have been shown has greatly taken so i 'd like to acknowledge then the others involved my co-members of the rat bags the reconciliation action plan advisory group who supported the idea and the endless house of our fabulous reconciliation officer donna stiller who ensured our dream was worked through respectfully to judge our own people and all council um and that all the council due process was done it 's a lot more than we realized and to happen council i 'd like to acknowledge that you took a chance on an idea and made it happen to the traditional owners i just want to say make this small gesture means something big let 's start a new track we can walk together with respect and better understanding my family and my elders i think they 're guiding me to this path and i hope there are many more footprints of many more,"(-37.3429596, 144.1421634)"

ribbon event angry anderson over to you angry thank you uh this is um oh reflection in the screen um actually they um i remember when i first started wearing glasses my kids uh told me that um it made me look um that much more intelligent but um a deception at best i um thank you so much for uh the invite and um i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and this is a a a completely new uh medium if you like um for for myself let alone i think for yourselves but as i understand you conduct uh meetings uh in this way uh might i um just to ask a favor that um if someone can interrupt at around about you know like when it 's about 10 minutes from home because i tend to lose track of time very easily um i i suppose when i say uh fortunately or unfortunately i have um um i 've experienced um it will be talking about domestic violence obviously i have experienced um domestic violence on on on different levels and different fronts if you like at different stages of my life um but then again in keeping with the great philosophy of life which i truly believe in and and i 've given myself over to um is that nothing in life is wasted now i learned that from a spiritual master many many years ago i started studying uh with a group to i had a thirst within me or a hunger if you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very early age that i was a physical entity obviously we we inhabit a physical body but of course um i learned from a very very early age um that there 's a great a great um strength that is drawn from belief in something above and beyond who and what we are um which is the the biological materialistic or the material body um to all outward appearances but we 're driven by or we 're possessed by um in in and of course what i say possessed in in a very positive manner by a spiritual force and that is the force that some people whether they be religious or um or just spiritual [Music] we realize that there 's more to life is what i 'm trying to say there 's more to life than just our physical existence now in keeping with that philosophy um i have learned um the hard road of experience has taught me some very very valuable lessons and and i am fond of saying and i have done um from a very very early ages uh on stage particularly uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been in existence in a playing form since then i mean with periods of inactivity but you know always kept alive as as my vehicle for for what i believe in and the things that i stand for having said that um and the reason i mention that is because i think a lot of people that um are aware of rose tattoo as a band um in the early days and of course we 're you know it 's very easy to be deceived by what we 're seeing um not not exactly in a lot of cases what we what is there to see um and i think the best way to explain that is never judge a book by its cover um so rose tattoo in the early days was um a fascination if you like and i mean that fascination in the true sense of the word um people were fascinated by the way we looked and the way we behaved on and off the stage and and uh particularly on the stage gratefully um but there was more to us than than than met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of of getting around to there 's more to everything that meets the eye and anyway the best place to start a story um i once very very wisely read is at the beginning how does how does someone end up with the nickname angry angry anderson of course anderson is my real surname um the son of anderson so to speak and um but angry well we really have to go right back to the beginning to to discover and this will enfold if i can articulate it well enough in my uh own particular way the story starts uh really with my biological father colin and um and my mum of course uh rosemary or rose marie or rose of the may mum 's mauritian and my father met her um when when he was he was my biological father was a it was a jockey and he was writing um meetings in in and around africa in uh in the mid 40s and um he was holler he was invited to holiday on mauritius by my my mother 's father and he met my mum and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rose de may which is rose of may because she was born in may so he meets her and she 's 17 year old classic looking mauritian so in a dark island-ish way to in physical appearance quite a stunning woman to look at of course very young at 17 and um you know a romance um eventuated and of course um my grandfather wouldn 't give permission to until she was at least 18. so uh colin stayed on the island for some time until six months or more until she turned to 18 and then asked for her hand in marriage and um so they lived on the island for a little bit longer you know to um i suppose so that she could several ties with a family etc and unfortunately and um this is something i found out only in my 40s um i was i was going i was undergoing therapy at the time for um to try and save my marriage but having said that um i was during the process of the the therapy i was compelled to ask my mother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colin and for my own reasons to deal with my own anger issues etc uh sadness stroke anger and so we went back and and she she told me uh the rather sad and tragic tale of um right up until they were married um it was a fairy tale romance system is a bloke from a place called australia um it was a very successful and quite famous international jockey um at the time she thought he was very very wealthy not that that was really important to her but it was to my grandfather long story short um they were married on the island and um and um mama arrived in melbourne with colin to meet his family in 1947 the year i was born so she was uh several months away from giving birth to me and this is where this is where it really begins i see in in a real sense for me personally was that um the story she told was that she arrived and of course by steve i will ship she arrives in melbourne with colin who had not prepared her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter and it would seem uh in a real sense he had not really prepared his parents and his siblings uh he told them very little as it turned out i found out later in later years talking to my uncles and aunts about my early life um they disclosed to me um uh which they kept in the early days they they were very distant from me but that 's part of the story um my grandfather they one of my one of my aunties told me the story that they all went down and meet the ship mum and and colin came down and um she was obviously pregnant with me but i think no more no one was more shocked than my grandfather um being mauritian my mother 's quite dark she 's got a a very delicate but a very very pronounced um island appearance about her um he was jack my grandfather was so taken aback that he and he was he was a brutal man in every sense of the word which is another dynamic we that we must uh appreciate he rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned about in therapy was there uh all different levels of what we call violence um and a lot of them are passive uh and we 've begun to deal with that as a society in recent days where um it 's you know there is um domestic abuse about the controlling of the of the person whether it be the female controlling the male or the male controlling the female um we 've seen that um particularly women can be intimidated by a physicality but also they they they have no power in the household the money 's withheld money 's controlled their movements are controlled um the way that they dress and and the people that they associate with etc etc but anyway i digress a little um so my grandfather disapproves of mum from very first sighting and he rejects her outward and my auntie told me the tragic story that my nana was you know besotted um with mum because you know she was had married uh colin and um nana took to to mum straight away the other members of the family were not taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reaction to her and he as the story was told turned around turned his back on his son with his about to be introduced um daughter-in-law and walked away and apparently when colin went to him and asked and said well you know look what 's wrong he said um as soon as the baby 's born the words to this effect um as soon as the baby 's born um i want you to put it back on a ship and send it back where she came from that 's a very very important dynamic to appreciate in in in my story so we we go to live with my grandparents a disaster that 's all i must adm i must tell you this part two which is uh when they did get to my grandparents home it was revealed uh you know to my grandfather that mum was not only dark of complexion and and not having a great grasp of english but she was roman catholic jack was a mason as were the two elder brothers in the family um that 's you know can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that era um roman catholicism and masonry so that just added fuel to the fire as far as jack was concerned so rejected entirely so um the instructions that were given to the family were that the family to ha were to have as little to do with mum and the appending arrival of mwah um so as not to form strong family bonds because as far as jack was concerned mum was going back to where she came from um anyway he they my grandparents gave mum fitted out a room at the back of the house uh for us to to live in um mum was forbidden from for going out in public um jack was absolutely ashamed of her and embarrassed by her presence the fact that um his um his son had married such a woman so um little by little i suppose people came to know that colin had brought his bride pregnant with his first child um back to to live with but of course very quickly realized that they weren 't going to form any strong relationship with us so um anyway the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i lived under these conditions because colin refused to send mum home which was just one in a long line of an antagonism that existed between jack and him in fact as i found out historically jack was not only a physically uh brutal man and he held physical sway over all around him um he was a man to be feared um but of course he he he was he was a violent uh in his emotional um relationship with his family um they were a family ruled over by a a um a bloody-minded um patriarch who who ruled i suppose with an iron fist so my nana of course by this time um was standing up for my mother and myself and um uh so as it as it unfolded we stayed at my grandparents place until i was six years old um which brings me to another thing that another another um dynamic that i 'd like to point out is that through our lives it goes without saying that there are decisions that we make that we 're totally responsible or should take total responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions irresponsibly and they impact on other people let alone themselves and they don 't take the responsibility for making that decision but there are um a series of um of decisions that we that we make for ourselves usually in as a reaction you know we learn that in in maths at school uh for every force there 's a reaction um but there are decisions made by other people that are totally irresponsible uh barbaric um violent if you like and um some of the some of these people make these decisions purely on on their selfish motivations in my story um at um at around about five or six years old i i was the victim of of pedophilia um and that was a dynamic of once um perpetrated against me committed against me that basically changed my life forever and um as you can imagine so these these uh this is where you know i try to always represent not just within in talking to people but with with the way that i live um the way i 've lived my life but in those first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a child kept at home not allowed to associate socially until of course i became school age and then i was at five when i was allowed to go to school but i was introduced at a very early age and to the very um value in my life medium in your life my life if you like that has been my savior in in a real sense and that 's music the youngest of the anderson brothers was a at that time um until he lost him to dementia he was a drummer he was a keyboard player and he played cornet he sang beautifully but he was a musician of uh of great skills had an amazing record collection and very quickly that i was introduced to that at a very very young age because i spent most of my time inside the house i mean i was allowed to go and play in the backyard of course but um i spent a lot of time with ivan and i spent a lot of time under his influence at a very early age in fact my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about three and um ivan allowed you to listen to his radio and uh and a bit later he would allow me access to his record collection um which i 'd sit for hours apparently while he played all these wonderful jazz records and and later on of course the blues influence that came into my life anyway at that stage um six years old we moved away from my grandparents home and we moved into a um an area in melbourne i grew up in melbourne uh called pasco vale which was a new suburb it was reclaimed farmland um on the outskirts of koberg and uh just the south of um there i was i was just about to say like so is there anybody from melbourne that 's watching i mean of course i know that you 're from victoria but you know having said that um so i grew up in pascal and um it was very very difficult because you know the people that bought in our area uh we 're buying vacant lots you know with pigs in the ground and pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and i was i grew up in pasco valley to my late teen years um of course um colin and this is dynamic that i have to introduce inherited from his father um quite naturally um when i say quite naturally um our biological children inherit you know much from us as parents i mean shape of areas the shape of their nose the color of their eyes um uh maybe their height in any other peculiar peculiarities physically but also uh we we are we are the inheritors of uh much of what our parents are as people um unfortunately colin was his father 's even though he hated his father with a passion and even though his father disapproved of him with a passion or with because violence is a passion um he inherited um the bad qualities from jack and um he was as i said he was a little big he was a jockey by trade and um he um i remember him um a vivid memory i have um of my childhood which illustrates um which is what i you know you you you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments in your life that were um life-changing and and or instructive in one way or another so an esoteric story um i remember as a in my before you know getting to teens at around about teen age colin um wanted to teach me to box he was a part of his training uh as a jockey as it turned out was that he was a um an amateur boxer that fought more than 20 fights as a boxer and was a fierce opponent and i can remember in the backyard and and colin i have this vivid memory um there 's two things one is taste one is is um sound and the taste is is my own blood in my mouth and the sound is his voice standing over me on many an occasion and i can hear his voice like it was yesterday and he would say get up gary get up and if i would lay there for more seconds he would be more demanding and he would stand over me and demand with no affection there was no in fact i never knew affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember i had no i have no memory of him ever holding me as i do with my sons and they 're they 're in their 30s now but daily i i hold them in my arms and tell them how much i love them i never had that from colin in fact i don 't i can 't remember one tender moment as a son um and believe me i have tried but i don 't remember one loving moment i never rem i cannot remember having ever said to colin ever in my whole life that i loved him all being told by him that i was loved by him and i had this vivid memory of him demanding that i get up and only to be knocked down again little did he know little did i know of course at the time that was a painful experience for me um he was teaching me a very valuable lesson and the the very valuable lesson of course is almost self-explanatory is that when you get knocked down in life you get up it 's one of the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always going to be brothers and sisters let me tell you this with all the authority that i can bring to this statement life is never going to be easy in fact um as i was going to say before um from the stage when i perform i do say these very things i i i try to plant seeds in people 's minds and hearts and um one of the things that i 've learned the very very hard way which is the best way to learn anything of value i remember jack used to say one of the things he used to say to me as a kid or he used to say to the family if it comes easy it 's not worth having he was a belligerent embittered man but there was great wisdom in what he said well i don 't think he actually realized that but there was um just as it was with colin demanding that i get back to my feet only to be knocked down again um but it taught me a very very valuable lesson and that is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret is to always get up and get on with it and do the best you can next time you get up anyway school was um let me say this um school was a traumatic um time for me i went through a state school i mean primary school apparently was um you know like like most childhoods should be um almost carefree if you like but i had this situation uh at home which was uh the absurdity of it during the day i seemed to be uh just like everybody else i went to school i laughed i played in the playground i was passively good at school in primary school but i was going home to a completely dysfunctional household at home mums and and colin 's relationship had deteriorated to the point where um what for instance when my brother was born who was 10 years between my brother and i when he came along um i was nine of course at the time my mom got pregnant and she told me that you know i was going to have a baby brother or sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it now and i thought to myself that this is a really strange thing but i centered on the fact that i was going to have competition anyway i dealt with that in therapy many years later as well um but looking back on it mum and dad were never the ideal couple i remember telling mum the story that i 'd go to houses in the street and i remember coming home one day and and um there was a family across the road and my mum said i must have been all about you know like eight or nine and i said to mum i saw a very strange thing happen today mum and she said what is that love and she said i said i was i was over at um at the froscott 's house and uh mrs foskett was sitting on his knee they were on the couch and he 's sitting on his knee and he was kissing her and mum said well you know that 's what they do they 're you know because they 're married and they love each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to understand well that didn 't happen in my house it didn 't happen in my family um mum and dad the only thing that i ever saw between um mum and colin was um mum 's fear of him and um quite a few times as a child witnessed um the physicality or or colin visiting physical intimidation if not direct violence on mum um he always if if i was around though and mum and i talked about this many many years later he he would step away from being physical with her only to um visit on her that that physical violence when when there wasn 't a witness but it wasn 't me but um walls being as thin as what they are the small or the you know the child mind was hearing sounds which as a man he can 't forget um again um being the lack of responsibility that we all must take um as males and females but as males and i can only speak from my own personal experience i 've having been a male most of my life um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i remember uh talking at a at a girls school and um and um i i said you know having been male 1 all my life and it was later um on um i was talking to this bunch of group of young women and one of them said um she said oh you know mr anderson she said um embryonically speaking um there 's a moment or you know after creation after we became become we 're not we 're neither and and i thought that was a very and you know she was all of 17. and i thought it was such a beautiful story i mean that she she wanted to tell me this um this you know this fact of life that uh there 's this this wonderful moment in their life when we 're neither but you know uh hormones etc etc and we take the path of being a female which take the path being a male and i used that story ever since because i just found it such a delight and i just wanted to share that with you so still was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a primary school age of course what comes along is secondary school of course i went to an all boys school uh in those days they were called technical schools and um in our area because it was a very very working class area very poor area um families were quite poor in those days in our area and uh and it was truly working class it 's actually when working class actually worked um so all around us were were tradesmen um the the person next door who um father of 13 children was a taxi driver um one of my best mates at school um his father was a long distance truck driver and um also drove a tow truck so that was kind of the kind of friends i had i suppose is what i 'm saying so during that time and i think this is the other dynamic um that 's very important in in anyone 's story is that right about that time comes puberty now puberty even um um when i said there 's lots of different levels of violence in someone 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonderment the creational process demands that the child now becomes something else now in a real sense emotionally let alone spiritually and of course we 're not really taught in western world spirituality we 're starting to embrace that now but um but biologically as as a you are puberty is not a peaceful or is not a gentle transitional period in fact it 's quite aggressive and it 's quite demanding and it 's quite but it is going to produce something um which which which of course we will all benefit from which is young adulthood um in the end but it is a a painful experience now years later of course uh during the um the therapeutic uh period first 20 years ago we dealt with my transition because inwardly i was a very very sad child and um but outwardly i was like a lot of sad kids i masked that with um being mr popular if you like or the the town clown if you like so um puberty um demanded that i you know something changed within me and my sadness my inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through into my 30s in the way that i 've been taught by my biological father and that was violence and i remember him saying to me as a as a kid he said you 'll you 'll always be a little bloke you 'll have to live in a big blokes world and he was very belligerent about this and um and of course he was physically a violent man not just to his family but to everyone in general and um that 's how he lived his life that 's how he taught me to survive is to be physically violent but of course what what we 've now begun to understand and we can appreciate now is that to be physically violent you must be emotionally violent um like i said um going back to what i 've learned is passive violence the fact that my my biological father never loved me never showed me any tenderness never taught me how to be um a gentle man he taught me how to be a violet man with my emotions and and you know with my fists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to swim he taught me to shoot taught me how to ride a bike uh but he taught me that the way to make my way in life was to be violent um but somewhere in my teen years and i discovered this through therapy i made a conscious decision and i think it might have even been before my teen years i made when i say conscious i think it was conscious but it would have been possibly an unconscious decision that i would not be what my father was and i did that to honour my mother i did that to honor this amazingly strong beautiful beautiful human being that i 'm fortunate enough to call my mum um who who clung to her religion um even when it did not serve her well when it when it demanded that she stay in this terribly destructive violent marriage another level of violence subtle but it has to be appreciated as a dynamic to fully understand if we 're to understand and we are to be part of the solution not the problem so the thing was um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me um but the thing that served me the the best and uh was my um my love of the arts it started from music um like in school just just to illustrate a point um i was good at two things one was art and the other one was english and i was fascinated by uh the written word i i started to read books for racistly um at um at an early age even in primary but certainly once i got into tech um my periods uh where i was um sent to the library um as disruptive naughty kids blokes boys were in uh have to go and go out into the into the schoolyard and clean up uh pick up rubbish or whatever that 's after one that 's after you you had three or six of the best um or you went to the library and while in the library i mean why not read a book so i mean i developed a voracious appetite for for written literature and also i found in literature the heroes that i needed in my life to inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquered um the darkness if you like and and the the things in life because all these wonderful books were written as esoteric lessons wonderful stories of adventure wonderful stories of fictional characters that righted wrongs and defended the weak and and and put things to write that were you know brought order out of chaos and um so i developed a great love of of uh very english and that so english lit and grammar um i still grappled with grammar to this day but it fascinates me um and um but i was sports-minded as well i mean i was just little so i wasn 't destined to be a great sportsman but i had a like all the boys in my area i had a great passion for for physicality and um i wasn 't afraid um really of um of bigger blokes uh physically or or mentally but anyway um i got out of school and my the great love of my life which was music and motorcycles as it turns out i um my grandfather um uh presented my mother actually at one stage this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indentured papers for an apprentice um um engineer the the diesel mechanic sorry for the navy and my mum had the wisdom of said oh look you know leave them with me jack and um and then she showed them to my to one of our neighbors and they said these are indenture papers to so gary will be off into the navy you know for seven years so of course mom didn 't sign them thank goodness for that but um anyway my uh one of my uncles got me a job as a fitter and turner apprentice fitter and turner and i uh saved up for my first motorcycle um but my great love was was music and kids blokes that i met at school we were forming bands and we were struggling to play music so it 's been as i said you know with the great passion of my life all through my life so it long story short um a series of years went by a series of bands went by i got into a band in melbourne that brought me recognition from touring around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving in sydney and i knew that there was um so it was the summer of 74 75 i would i 'd met some uh blokes who were later we were to form rose tattoo and uh i went back to uh to melbourne i packed all my goods and moved permanently to sydney in 75 and rose tattoo were formed and that um that basically was the uh you know the turning point really in my life as far as the rest of my life because here i am still here um still craving to perform um can 't wait to get back to work but so anyway um rose tattoo uh it turns out extraordinary band um in fact um using someone else 's words um one of the great rock bands of history not that i 'm going to argue with that but um having said that again rose tattoo was set up by five um misfits if you like much like myself as it turns out years later when we were close enough in a sense to to disclose to one another um we all had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm a survivor these days i 'm not a victim but um a similar background to our domestic lives and which is again why we came together in a band birds of a feather do indeed flock together and um rose tattoo became famous for two things one of our physicality our appearance but also a very physically exaggerated or or exotic if you like performances and um we went overseas and and and made a real name for ourselves to the point where which was uh very generously alluded to in the in my introduction uh that we we actually have uh influenced some you know other bad boy bands but none bad one bad one better than rose tattoo i might say um and no one better than than angry anderson um which i suppose in a philosophic sense has served me very very well over these years and i 'm very very often apart from being often asked how did how did i end up with the nickname angry i 'm also very often asked what was the moment that changed your life what changed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i was keeping company with um my children 's mother and um uh it was a very you know it was an amicable arrangement um she was a very lovely looking young woman and um so we had a great relationship but in all honesty once i came back from the first touring overseas i did say to her um uh my life now is going to be spent predominantly overseas touring and um i 'm not going to lie um i need to be single to take advantage full advantage of this um you know and i must admit at this stage and it 's part of my story i 've spent many many many years uh addicted to alcohol i was becoming addicted to drugs and i 'd always been addicted to bad behavior um or dysfunctional behavior so uh being angry anderson in rose tattoo the baddest rock band in the world um i was being paid to be dysfunctional so we were at our best stroke worst uh in those late 70s early 80s years and that 's when i came to notoriety um right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite wisdom once described me as the single greatest threat to the stability of australian youth um which many years later when he was appearing on midday when i was working with ray martin on midday i had cause to remind him of that statement but that 's just a personal story i um it was 83 my daughter was born um i didn 't want to be a father i i thought that because my father was he was towards at the end of his career he was diagnosed as being criminally or he was a danger to people he was um had a mental condition and lost his license to ride um and he he actually spent some time in jail for being um uh and he was well he was you know he was insane in a sense um they said that he had a mental condition which um i don 't exactly know what it was but anyway he spent some time in a you know he 's not in jail but an institution and so i thought you know that possibly i would have inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as i said i was in those days addicted to drugs and alcohol and bad behavior and um it was serving me well this is another dynamic we must embrace if you like or at least to understand to understand the series of the events that um i refer to as my life um but um mysteriously um the mother of our children got fell pregnant i went away touring in america and i as i said had my stroke best stroke worst um my consumption of drugs and alcohol was um you know ridiculous and i was suffering really really badly physically and i was mentally i was a wreck and um spiritually i was a desert and um within me as as as as the wisdom of the great divine dictates there was a gnawing feeling in me a hunger like i said before at first but somehow there was more to life than this more to life than sex and drugs and rock and roll and um the divine in her infinite wisdom uh gave me the opportunity to change and um i remember the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived from a break and touring from america and [Music] so to this day i cannot i cannot relive this moment without feeling those those feelings i felt then and i remember the first time i met her and i asked my mum and dad were there and um her mom and dad and there was assorted relatives and i asked after about half an hour of pleasantries you know welcome home and congratulations you 're a father asked could i spend because i go and meet my daughter and as we walked in the hallway i remember turning to her mother lindy and i say i don 't take this too badly but i i i felt instinctively i needed this moment with her for myself i must have sensed the brothers and sisters the moment and i do believe this i think we are given these insights the great wisdom as i said of the divine the creational process god if you like whatever terminology we use to describe what we don 't understand what we believe in and i remember sitting there we closed the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not wake the child don 't wake the baby no i have no intention of waking the baby so i remember sitting there on the bed and she 's in a bassinet beside the bed sat there for a long time to the point where i thought i could hear her breathing she was asleep of course and i remember she moved and it startled me and her hand came out from under the rug and it just sat and i was struck by how small it was it was no bigger than my thumb this tiny perfect little hand and i i remember i couldn 't help myself i didn 't intend to wake her but i took my little finger and i placed it into the palm of her hand and her fingers closed around my my finger and her eyes opened and i realized then in a flash regardless of what had happened up until that moment everything was going to be all right from that moment on i knew there was sense to it all there was some sort of divine plan not pre-planned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course we do but the wisdom is what i mean the wisdom of it and i was struck and i knew then in that moment my life as i 'd known it was over and a new life had just begun and that was a fairly in the days that follow that was a fairly frightening prospect because i i was going to give up all that i knew for her for this perfect human being that in that moment when she opened her eyes now years later i told the story to a group of people and one of them was a pediatrician pediatrician and he said to me after i told the story he said you know angry at three weeks old a child you know can 't focus because i what i said was when i looked into her eyes i saw her but i was allowed to see her because when she looked into my eyes she saw me and i realized in that moment she looked at me like no other human being had ever looked at me no judgment she just saw me i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again just as years ago as i made a commitment to rosemary my mother that i would protect her that i would do whatever i possibly could her and any other one like any other woman like her i made that commitment to roxanne that day in that moment i would be the best father she could ever have and it meant giving up everything i knew everything and it was the easiest decision easily one of the easiest decisions i 've ever had to make and i made a commitment to her until this day she still tells me that i 've lived up to that and in recent times we 've had cause to share our strengths to share what we have between us not just roxy and i but the boys as well so my life changed then forever and i became or started to become the person that i was meant to be because of her and so far so good i um i went on to work in television um i would never have got the opportunity to work in television if it hadn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television with ray from working with street kids um that 's another story for another day um i can only imagine allow me if i can put my glasses on and just say oh yeah 7 30 8 30 that 's about an hour um so the point is i think the point that i 've i 've always tried to make brothers and sisters is the harder it gets and the harder it is the more opportunity we have to be who we 're meant to be and i 've tried to be as a male as good a man as my mother dreamt or labored to produce she instilled in me an unwavering faith in humanity she never gave up one day i want a lot of book about all i 've talked about and i 'll tell you about her and what she went through and i 'll tell you about how strong that 's made me and the strength that roxanne 's given me over the years but the commitment i made to her that she would not have a father biological but father like i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she only knew love from and my boys too there 's not a moment ago there 's not a day goes by that i don 't tell my children how much i love them we finish every conversation with i love you i love you dudes my daughter calls me dudes um there 's not a time they walk out the door that i don 't hug them and kiss them and tell them which is why i remember the last thing i said to liam because because it 's the last thing i say to them whenever they leave the room the last thing i would have said to him was a lovely mate he he would have said i love you too pots and that 's that 's a commitment so if i 'm asked it 's 73 years old how 's it going like it 's going pretty well so far i 'm doing pretty good i 've turned out to be the man i thought i was always going to be or should have been and should be and i 'm grateful every shitty lousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been well worth learning and there 's always like i say and i mean this i know this brothers and sisters i know this it 's like the first time i looked into roxy 's eyes i knew it 's all gonna be okay it all is okay you just gotta live up to the commitment of our life itself we were put here to be good and decent human beings and at the end of the day i don 't care about too much else apart from the fact that um you know i 've turned it i want to be a decent human being and that 's what i want for you too i want you to be the people that you are meant to be and we can go into the politics and whatever at another time that um i want to say two things i want to say thank you so much for the opportunity and the point is i mean apart from the fact that you know everyone needs to earn a crust what you 've allowed me this this opportunity to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this i feel like i 'm worthwhile and that i 'm doing something that 's valuable in a sense to myself but you know if if it 's true what i believe then it 's it 's for all of us and i want to thank you for that because passively you you 've not known this but i want to thank you because you 're part of my healing process and that 's so that 's something that you need to know from me and something that can 't be valued so may your god go with your brothers and sisters whoever and whatever you see that as and um hopefully one day we 'll get to shake hands thank you angry i can 't believe how great and you 've been um provided so much insight and um so open that you have been i 'm sure people that have been on tonight have been touched by your openness and uh thank you very much lee for that can i say a big thank you for the people that have tuned in um as i said this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of the community um to family violence um and tonight we 've had the pleasure of uh hearing from angry in his life and uh i 'm sure each and every one of you has got something out of some of the important words that he said tonight so thank you angry no whackers good enjoy and good night,"(-37.3429596, 144.1421634)"

Australia",1656,[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we 're now standing on the on the Laden River this is about six kilometers north of bearing up it 's a place not many people know about and we 've come here and we 're telling you about this because it 's sort of been lost to history for a whole range of reasons it was important in 1840 because this was the original site that Edward Parker who was the assistant protector of Aborigines finally chose as the place to start this aboriginal Protectorate we now know it was an idea that was bound to fail but he was motivated by the best of Christian intentions and after looking a lot of places in the landscape he ended up coming here just to go back a bit Parker had arrived in Melbourne a year or so before hand and he 'd been camping temporarily at a site somewhere near Sunbury with his wife and young family he had a lot of kids and they were reluctant to move out of that place because they were moving sort of beyond Melbourne into an area where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long way away and so he basically had a series of expeditions during 1840 early 1842 hit on exactly where he might go and after a lot of searching and a couple of couple of trips into the northwest he ended up finding this area right here on the Lord and River on a very big waterhole this was probably a traditional camping place when this place didn 't work out so well I said they 'll move to their other favorite traditional capping price of it which is live at the foot of Mount Franklin or algum couple of little things we know about one the aboriginal name for the wrong man for the places they 're among a name on which we thought sort of means to hide here or to feel safe here but Barry I think you found and another word caisson and with a bit of a different meaning but again we 're on the Laden River yeah it 's rich countryside here our people a Laden River people so this was one of the another one a favorite camping places there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that Bowser dog Matt Franklin Lana Barrowman which means place of the MU and we 've got another one just up the road from here at a Teddington cool on a curry oh it 's a public means place for the kangaroo so we know the people can 't hear there 's even a corroboree site down the river a bit so it 's more than likely this was a favorite traditional camping place but it was also rich in resources and fish you found another word close to narrow month they have a different meaning very yeah in some of the writing in the last hundred years people of sort of thought through Parker it might have been about Nariman meaning something about hide here but I found in the unicorn dictionary a word spelt much the same Nariman which means high bank you know it might be that hide here and high bank mean the same thing because the high bank could be a good place to hide but that 's what characterizes this site when we 're standing up here on this hill looking down onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red gums this is an incredibly high bank and and to explain why the idea of coming here I mean it sounds bizarre and yeah but basically we 've got a list of all of the tools that Parker brought to this site and his idea was basically to he bought a whole lot of wheel barrow picks shovels a big box of English seeds and so they basically created the cultivation paddock here and the idea was that if you could get people Aboriginal people to garden that somehow they would become civilized and Christians but we can sort of say that was not such a good idea in retrospect but that was the prevailing view was if we can get these people to live in one place and be productive and be self-sufficient then we will bring them to God but I mean they had a whole range of problems like old news site Parker talked about trying to run a church service and he couldn 't get the men and women to assemble in the same place you might like to talk about that why might that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women 's business aboriginal society if you look at the Kulin nation which is of a central victorian tribes coolin or remains man sort of a man orientated peoples so it was probably quite a divided thing at the start that the men would congregate with the men and the women would congregate with the women but they young landed at the end of us very choppy I spell so hence the failure of their crops and vegetable crops and stuff so of a sort of failure before I even began and there was another reason why this place fire basically it was because when Parker chose his side there were very few squatters in the landscape but by the time he got there he had Simpson who was on shallop lines he had makinen up on the foot of Taran Gow Hepburn was over at at cruising so there were a whole lot of squatters that were taking up the landscape taking up the land excluding the original people from the water holes and so there was conflict and death and obviously people were running out of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and basically said to them what the hell are you doing here why are you having anything to do with these people and so this the squatters actually challenged Parker and and said you know why you 're here helping these people we 're trying to farm this place and obviously had very different views about this stuff the last thing I wanted was an Aboriginal reserve exactly and so it wasn 't just the drought that caused people to leave this place it was basically the pressure from the squatters and what made it even worse was that by that stage the squatters actually owned the newspapers and some of the squatters in this area actually owned some of the newspapers in Melbourne so they were feeding pretty negative stories back to Melbourne to try and get the government to basically reverse the Protectorate policy so basically they 're only on this side for maybe eight or ten months and then they moved all of the people as many as 200 people actually on this side and they moved back to a area of land that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin it was one of the first places in northwestern Victoria where there was at least some attempt to do something other than move people off country and while it 's it 's important that we 're critical of what they did and it 's important to be critical what they the negative things that happen here I guess we have to acknowledge that that they were giving something ago what 's different about this area and why we 've come here is not because this is a heroic thing that the settlers and the government did it 's just that there 's a huge amount of evidence here about what was and about what happened and I guess the whole reason for this reconciliation processes is that we 're able to acknowledge what happened and that 's what this tool has been all about it 's not about guilt but it 's about truth for me as a non Aboriginal person it 's really important that when we live in a landscape we acknowledge what happened if we don 't do that then we 're living well we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary school and secondary school I 've a castle mine and we let the cat that can cook arrived and there was Aborigines we didn 't learn there was 200 on the reserve just 15 odd guys out the road and and stuff so yeah I agree might we need to educate the local people about the local history and I think if we can do that well we 're putting one foot in front of the other towards reconciliation by educating the wider community you know there 's not many places there 's probably no places whenever some people didn 't walk didn 't sit down didn 't camp didn 't hunt didn 't gather and you know there 's stuff still in there in the way in skype canoe trees grinding stones and stuff but you know there could be stuff very well in your own backyard if you look you know we can we can dig away at a bit of ground and find stone tools earth ovens and stuff so the message I would like people to take away is every some people probably can 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably every some wall contracts that now become roads you know if you can look closely in the environment there 's still evidence of Aboriginal occupation even around on the edges of our towns tips they 're finding grinding stones and Rockwell 's and things yes yes no i original occupation is welcome back [Music]

Australia",1295,"[Music] [Music] hi [Music] hi my name 's Rick Nelson I 'm a descendant of the judge our young people today we 're at the southern end of judge our own country we 're approaching Mount Greenwich and we 're going to go up there and have a look at the surrounding landscape and explain a little bit about that and hell that was back in the early 1800 we are just north of Ballarat and most of judge our own country is to the north east and northwest a bit more so we 're at the southern end of judge our own country and yeah we 'll just explain a little bit how this country minor pain okay I 'm Barry Golding I live in a similar landscape to this over near crushing another scoria volcanic mountain like this one so where we 're standing at the base of this this mountain was actually a basalt flow and the rocks around us which your vessel and scoria some of them are really light they got chucked out of the mountain top up the top there 's a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Glasgow it 's another volcano and the whole heap of other volcanoes or scoria cones down to the south and over towards Daylesford so when we get up the top of this hill we 'll see a whole lot more appear they 're the ones in hepburn Shire two of the biggest ones would have been called khru Chang and murica this two got their names a lot of the other ones of we call on by other names but when major Mitchell came over this Hill in 1836 he called them amyloid hills cuz he reckons they look like breasts in the landscape so that 's how we got their names so it 's worth sort of establishing why this area became important and why we 're going up to the top and why we 've included in this tool for you so basically a basalt flow came from this mountain and from a whole lot of other mountains around two million years ago and it covered the whole of the ground around here apart from a few of the bigger hills with a whole lot of rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became a pretty rich landscape which was rich for Aboriginal people and it 's also rich for the pastoralists who came here following Mitchell in 1836 and today it 's typically used for sheep and cattle grazing up towards the top of the divide is used for potatoes and was also reached for gold their gold underneath these rocks was in the gravels we call them deep bleeds and so the white male keeps that you see in the landscape around here or mine in the 1860s so basically these ribbons of larvae were like volcanic highways and they weren 't just important for Aboriginal people to get around but they became important for the early invaders colonists who came over these grasslands and that 's basically why major Mitchell came here because he was following an existing highway and Mitchell put mount Greenwich on a map because he followed this line and people who followed him called it the majors line he came through in wet year there were wheel tracks in the landscape and people followed it so I might just flick now to rick whom i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe talk about the clans and that sort of stuff because what you 've seen but you know to talk about what mitchell might have seen when he came down the highway well basically there was around 20 clans in the judge our our nation spread over basically around 2,000 square case guys from between Creswick and Ballarat down to macedon up north to apne occurring and then west again I have to Charlton and sign on it and back down through ViCAP back down to and there Creswick so there 's around 20 clients there in this area we would have had about three or four clans around us here so my veneer Maryborough there was a clan there 's a clan around Alfred and that Franklin another clan over towards castle mine so there 's three or four clans probably in this area and as you can see it 's quite an open grassland these were original grasslands so I wasn 't completely wooded it was hyper grasslands Aboriginal people would tend to do camp on the edge of the wooded areas so does not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape would have been yellow from the yeah indices of the Minang Daisy this was a staple fallback diet for the Aboriginal people and Augustus Robinson talks about coming over Smeaton Hill of Mount Fuji and virtually as far as you know I could see the fields were yellow there was open fields of yellow the yam daisies and as he got down to the foot of curry Chang he came across 20 to 40 women all digging up the yam daisies the men will go on off into the red gum forests and the women were digging up the yam daisies so what we see here in this is open fields around map grown up were probably originally like this I would say buried the agree with that yes well there 's there 's a bit at least about maybe 30 or 40 scoria cones which which have got this breast like shape in the landscape and each of those would have would have would have had names each of these would have had really rich grasslands but no them they would have had Springs coming out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber towards the bottom that 'd be an ideal place for creating a semi-permanent campsite and so a lot of these had ovens down the base of them where people cook for hundreds and thousands of years they 'd come back to the place obviously in the grasslands you couldn 't have a fire without wood there were no wood liveries in those days so people really have to have their oven somewhere near where there was trees and they 're often sort of adjacent to the red gums where there was plenty of plenty of timber bit of shelter bit of water and as you say Rick a lot of lot of um daisies so maybe maybe you 'll might like to talk about the clans around this area and what we know about them though there 's one clan just over the way around Carisbrook and we know there was a green stone quarry there when there were some people would get quarry the green stone and might mean to access stone axes so we know there was a quarry and a clan around Carisbrook of the castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caliburn rivers the gal gal baroque people lived over there yeah three or four clans around here we know that Mitchell came up onto some of these amyloid little Hills using for four high points to look out and Aboriginal people done the same thing I 'm used to high points for four luckily outs you know you can see the smoke off in the

Australia",3619,council acknowledges the color nation for their custodianship and management of these lands and waterways their enduring connection and their elders that pass these practices and wisdom across generations [Music] we are here today with counsel to celebrate World Environment Day and the biodiversity of the area we 're here with deputy mayor Sandra Wilson and David de Silva and Ranger Andrew Webster we 're going to have a chat with each of them to discuss their favorite areas and topics tell us about some of the natural assets and areas that we have in Hobson 's Bay what we don 't often realize over here in Hobson 's Bay is that we 've got twice as much open space there 's other councils in the Melbourne metropolitan region you know not only that but most of them are fairly accessible too we 've got the bay west bike trail that goes along the path we 've got tracks that go up through all the creeks and then we 've got a park like Newport likes where there 's great carpark and plenty of access points around there cool Doug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent years well what we 've actually noticed is that we 've had a bit of erosion or moving of sand along our four shores and we 've got down here just down here to see I 'm the altona coastal park there 's been a lot of erosion over the last few years but at the same time we 've actually fine is a big sandbar turning up couple hundred meters offshore now that 's sandbar which is naturally occurring is actually providing a very large shallow tidal area which is awesome for our wading birds particularly our birds that come from the other side of the world Siberia Alaska places like that in fact this year we had 19 different species that actually flew all the way over from Alaska or Siberia this year and then of course you 've got down the end of the Esplanade here you 've got down at the mouth 11 and Creek opposite Doug grant Reserve there you 've got that other landscape that 's warming down there as well now which again is providing awesome habitat for that the bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I 'll mention on this is what 's been going on in Council is that now we 've got this great sort of system of wetlands as well now and these wetlands are actually trapping the storm or to the rainwater so in the old days where maybe water rushed down the gutters down the roads picked up litter oil rubbish on the way took it out to the bay now we 've got wetlands like Cyril curtain at Williamstown the rifle range wetlands frog and ina park wetlands down here and even wetlands up at Laverton and they 're just aside from filtering out the baddies out of the water they 're really awesome habitat for whether it 's ducks frogs any of those sorts of animals awesome natural habitat and I suppose one for the sport finds sport guys out there we also use any excess water to irrigate some of our ovals now as well which saves us use in the drinking water so that 's a really good change can you tell us some more about these open spaces yes sure Doug yeah well one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having so much open spaces we 've got such diversity we 've got the parks like where we are here today Logan Reserve like manicured parks we 've got awesome sports grounds we 've got the Botanic Gardens down at Williamstown an awesome place and historically very very significant and then of course you 've got the places where I 'm really sort of fond of our conservation reserves where you 've got our old now old I 'll turn a tip that 's now trigger 9 a park you 've got the old explodes the reserve you 've got the old rifle range reserve that 's now what 's still the rifle range reserve but now it 's been rehabilitated you 've got the old quarry that 's now Newport Lakes yep you 've got the are Williamstown racecourse which is the alternate coastal park and then you 've got the old sort of dredging or dumping grounds down in Newport that are now actually known as the Sandy Point Nature Reserve and then of course don 't forget the creeks Quarry Creek Leviton Creek scold and Creek these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people dumping zones things like that now predominately with the help of awesome help from environmental volunteers friends groups and the like and obviously with council those areas now they 've got walking paths through them and they 're very desirable places to go now aside from the fact that they 're great habitat for our native animals what are some of the native animals that our visitors can expect to see well I 've already touched on on the birds we 've got a massive variety of birds and ducks around here in fact someone like Newport likes alone as more than 160 species in itself just there and that 's only one of our reserves then you 've got all your your reptiles or things like you Blue Tongue lizard you 're cutting em skinks our friendly tiger snakes of course which we all love and then something that a lot of people don 't really sort of I suppose we don 't see them is they 're nocturnal animals so we don 't think about them much I suppose we all know we 've got possums around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about again you tend to not not see them but they are out there and the other thing that 's worth touching on is our bats nice they will probably know about the grey headed fruit bats but what we don 't think about is a little microbe bats and as the name says they 're micro they 're only sort of so big and they 're the type of bat your love in your backyard on that warm summer 's evening they 're out there eating your moths or your bugs and most importantly they 're eating in mozzies so something really really important one of the animals we 've got quite a lot of different species and large numbers that we don 't tend to think about too much okay Andrew tell us how we can protect these animals I suppose I can simplify it by saying doing the right thing but what is the right thing we 've got a lot of I suppose I 'll start with our pets yep we 'll start with dogs we 've got a lot of signs around the place that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take your dogs in to an area of dogs prohibited well there for a reason now the number of times I get people say to me especially on the air for story area oh but my dog doesn 't chase the birds well it may not necessary chase them but it 's disturbing them they may be sitting on a nest they may be feeding there may be resting the dogs still making them fly up go somewhere else when perhaps they don 't really want to and then there 's the other situation where we might say no dogs aren 't allowed in there and then people put them on the leader think well that 's ok yeah are you because that way they can 't chase anything but what they forget is that dogs also leave a scent behind especially so if they go to the toilet now so if they walk past a let 's say a swans nest and the dog maybe its leg or something like that then that might be enough to stop the mother duck or the father duck coming back onto that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and then and then we 've got our cats now the statistics shown has been some recent surveys on it show that for every roaming cat that 's it cats that are allowed to sit a rhyme our parks and outside in the daytime and more importantly in the nighttime they kill on average one hundred and eighty six animals a year it 's a staggering number so obviously it 's really really important we care about cats inside and particularly in the evenings and then the other thing is that so you find an injured animal in one of our parks or something like that there 's an organization called wildlife Victoria they 're staffed by volunteers and if you do see something it looks like it might be struggling injured dehydrated something like that you give them a call and they 'll point you in the right direction either though come and actually take the animal off your hands and look after it well they might just suggest you take it to the local vet or something like that and can you tell us how we found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of different ways like we 've got there 's obviously information on the council website and dr. Google of course there 's lots of stuff as well but inside our conservation reserves we 've also got a number of interpretation signs in fact we 've got 54 at last count these aren 't signs that say do not feed the birds no dogs no cats not signs like that there are actually signs that actually highlight the wildlife that 's in the area what 's actually there so that you can actually when you walk around the park you can actually look for those particular animals maybe what you should or shouldn 't do to look after them and so I do find that generally any of their conservation reserves if you turn up there then we 've plenty of interpretation it 'll help help you about that and also we 've also got brochures and again like we said before on the council website as well right so look here for those science is a great Dave why trees such an important part of environment and what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important some people don 't understand how important they are again if you jump on Google you 'll find a whole range of benefits at trees herb to us as people you 'll find 2030 different attributes what makes them so variable for Hobson 's Bay there 's two in particular the first one being the reduction of heat whether you choose to believe climate change or not it 's getting hotter summers are really hot a lot of days over 30 degrees all of those over 40 trees reduce the ground surface temperature you know if it 's 40 degrees outside you go under a tree it 's 30 degrees so they make our environment a lot more comfortable in those instances as well as still encouraging people to walk if it 's a hot day you 're not going to go outside because top but if you 've got a nice trail that 's shaded you 're more likely to still go for a walk on a nice hot day well it 'll be a lot more comfortable the second one is cleaning our air we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy Main Roads trees are the ultimate air conditioners they catch carbon they clean pollutants out of the air make things a lot more healthy and comfortable for us so definitely the two biggest values that trees have in hops is by reducing what local temperatures as well as cleaning our air there many other trees in hovels bay area that are important for heritage reasons yes I touched on here in our town I mean we use town but in Newport as well we 've also got a healthy population of some native trees big lemon-scented gums in some streets here there are some trees of you know a great value due to the age and also just due to its size and contribution to the landscape there 's a fair bit there I want you to dig deep I 'm sure people wouldn 't go and discover their own can 't they yes exactly okay great could you tell us a bit about the important territories trees in Hopkins Bay and what makes them important yeah so we do have some pockets in the municipality which have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at like a reserve we 've got the Moreton Bay Fiegel on Queen Street which has just been put on the National Trust Register right and we 've also got the Norfolk Island pines just behind us on the Esplanade now these trees are significant for different reasons mainly due to age in this instance the Logan Reserve Moreton Bay fig is estimated to be about 100 years old we 've got photos showing the trees still being you know still showing to be a reasonable size in the early 1900s and we do know that the Norfolk Island pines were planted post-world War two right it 's part of a project with the show where we in Charvel town as it was call back then so listen even for their age but also just for the amenity value you know the Norfolk Island pines look fantastic provide a lot of shape the beachgoers typically in the late 1800s Early 1900s it was very popular for people to establish Cypress hedges to protect other vegetation within their properties or gardens it 's been done in Williamstown Botanical Gardens and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were part of plantations from the late 18-hundreds early 1900s again to protect the guards that they were trying to establish as part of the homestead here they do once they do get old they start to get a few issues but we try management 's best we can to keep them apart of landscape we 've also got a number of trees and we use ten we 've some being an older suburb or a lot of history there a lot of old trees in there as well which are covered in a heritage overlay within our planting scheme there 's some fantastic trees which are really strong heritage territories you 've seen hopson 's by that 's great thing I love about trees is they not only just provide just general comfort and make everything feel welcoming around you but that you can interact with them now we 're here at local reserve kids are climbing on the branches and some of the lower trees here people are playing hide-and-seek and pretend they 're camping so you can interact a lot with trees especially with the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawke 's Bay why is this important to you well Doug who can deny the majesty of trees in our neighborhood we 're standing behind behind and underneath are one of the most magnificent trees that we have in Hudson 's Bay which is a Moreton Bay fig it 's only significant tree register and it 's one of a multitude of really special trees in Hobson 's Bay but why I care so deeply is trees give us nature on our doorstep and the connection with nature is really important they are amidst a world of built infrastructure a magnificent array of green infrastructure which provides habitat taking away of carbon emissions the protection from the Sun the cooling elements in in a world that 's dealing with climate change and as I began the majesty of trees is just something that 's so special and if we need any further evidence or understanding well we just all have to read the Lorax and and and see why trees are so important in any community in any neighborhood that 's the great says thank you you do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's really difficult because I have many favorite places and many favorite trees across Hobson 's Bay this is this I 'd have to say as one of them but if I 'm going to start in a place where I spend a lot of time that 's very close to the hundred steps up in Altona Meadows which is close to where I live what we 're blessed with in Hudson 's Bay is a whole contiguous network and that 's a connected open spaces and biodiversity areas conservation areas that are all joined together and if you walk through those areas there 's a number of very special trees I mean there 's lots of trees but there 's some very special trees there 's a stand of sugar gums that runs on the edge of HD Graham Reserve which was the natural boundary of the truck Nina explosives was reserved and there 's something like I 'd estimate a hundred sugar gram gums that grow in a double Avenue and until you it 's actually pointed out to you you 're not really aware of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 're so beautiful if you continue along the Levitan Creek there is a remnant river red gum that sits just outside the fence of the explosives reserve and that is a very old and significant tree if you were to bypass it you just think it 's just a stump your gum tree gnarly old gum tree but it has a lot of specialty about it there 's a bench seat underneath it and I recommend that anybody go and sit and observe the beauty of this tree I want to speak a little bit about something that isn 't a tree but is also a favorite it 's in our wetland says Old Crow growth forest which is the salt marsh now it 's not technically a tree but it is a whole array of plants that provide the value to our environment that our trees and urban first will provide and so I just like to draw people 's attention to the fact that salt salt marsh mangroves and seagrass provide just as many benefits to our natural environment and our and our health and well-being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big part of the ecosystem an important part of the ecosystem and those connections between trees parks conservation areas wetlands river ways waterways is critically important and great to celebrate on World Environment Day that 's right a lot of people have connections with trees and hoppers Bay that aren 't a part of the national repair tree to tree register how do they let council know and get them engaged involved well as part of World Environment Day and listening to a very able conservation Ranger Andrew Webster and also our coordinator of trees david de silva well they are very passionate about our local area and they know many of our special and significant trees if you wanted to if people wanted to let our staff know about the process to get a significant tree on the national heritage tree register they would certainly know but we don 't necessarily need the council to do that I 'm undertaking a process on my own to nominate the stand of sugar gums in HD Graham Reserve and I 'm putting in an application myself with the help of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they 'll be known protected and celebrated by many more people so it 's easy to find out on Google how to do this process but anyone who loves trees as much as I do and as much as you do Doug could actually find out about that process and do it but our able staff are also very willing to help because we all love trees together I understand that you and a number of other residents have had a great deal of input into our World Environment Day celebrations what else are you aware of sure so as part of the World Environment Day activities Council is supported and created a conservation map where people can see biodiversity and heritage trees on a map of Hopkins Bay so they can go and discover their own near them and that 's a great feature that will be probably growing there 's a good word and discover what 's in there in their own area that 's fantastic and I would just like to thank you

Australia",21050,well good morning everyone my name 's susette rodarita if you haven 't met me before and the other bloke who 's been talking is andrew webster and we 're the conservation rangers here at hobson 's bay city council we also have the extraordinary jackie heron here with us who 's always one of the main drivers of world migratory bird day celebrations and normally she 's out front and center spinning her incredible yarns about migratory birds however this year jackie is going to be on the back end here with andrew and i helping out with the administrative duties of a zoom meeting it 's so it 's really great to see everyone who 's come along to help us celebrate this well some of you i can see and some of you i can see names so it 's fantastic to see you all here um and you know help us celebrate the arrival of the migratory shorebirds back to our beaches for yet another year um and today as you can see on the schedule we have a number of guest speakers lined up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds and hopefully also have a bit of fun along the way so as you can see we 've structured the day so that our four main presenter presentations are broken up with a half hour break in the middle and this can be a refreshment break for everyone we 'll also put this running sheet up on the chat if anyone would like to see what 's coming up in case you don 't already know and keep in mind that one of the big advantages of these zoom presentations is that you can come and go as you please now of course we 'd love everyone to stay around for the whole for the whole day but we fully understand that it 's not always easy to stay glued to a screen for long periods and hence the break we have in the schedule and that zoom link that you use to to log on will also enable you to log on again in the future if you if you drop out it will enable you to have the ability to come back on later on uh we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 3 p.m this afternoon that the hobsons bay wetland center group will be hosting which is a special presentation on zoom because today is also significant in that it is world mental health day particularly important i think to acknowledge and celebrate um even a lot of us have been dealing and struggling with uh isolation and lockdown and the hobsons bay wetlands centre group have invited dr rebecca patrick a senior lecturer in health at deakin university to present on the mental health benefits of connecting with nature andrew is going to put the zoom link to that up in the chat as well so you 're welcome to tune in to that at 3 pm this afternoon now you 've probably noticed that you 've been automatically muted as you enter we do welcome any questions on the chat function during the presentation and in a moment i 'll tell you a bit more about how to access that chat function if you 're not familiar with that and we have both andrew and jackie in the background to help with answering questions now if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also hit the little drop down button arrow where it says everyone and you can send either jackie or andrew a private question if you wish meaning that they will be the only ones able to see your question and you will be the only one able to see their reply we do actually ask that you keep your messages on the chat relevant to the topic because it can be quite distracting for all of us if the chat box is constantly pinging with people saying hello to each other for example so to ask a question on the chat this appropriate slide up in the not appropriate slide now there was an appropriate slide up in the background but anyway i 'll go through it to ask a question on the chat if you 're on a laptop there 's an icon on the toolbar that comes up on the bottom of your screen that says chat click on that and then on the bottom right of your screen you 'll see a message saying type message here if you 're on an ipad and hopefully other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're on a tablet tap your screen to bring up the toolbar and it usually comes up on the top of your screen and you can click on the three little dots and then you 'll have the option to chat or raise your digital hand it comes up as a little blue hand if you 're on a smartphone tap your screen and the toolbar will come up at the bottom of the screen and tap on the three little dots where it says more and then you have the option to raise your hand or chat and if you 're not comfortable with asking a question there may be on the chat function there may be a chance throughout the morning to verbally answer questions but we will have to play that by ear and see how we 're going for time and see how we 're going for the number of questions we 're getting in um most importantly we are recording today so if you don 't want to be on the recording please click your little video icon off in most cases it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen and if you haven 't touched it it may well be off it may have just started with you off it will have automatically defaulted to off when you joined when it has a red line through it that means it 's off um also note that if you do verbally ask a question your voice may be recorded now even if you 're not worried about being recorded we will actually ask that it 's best if you do keep your video off as this generally helps with the quality of the live streaming all right that 's all the kind of administrative stuff so i 'm going to stop sharing my screen now so you you 'll see me a bit bigger probably so can i just sorry internet one for one sec um to message to marilyn and nick um i 'm having trouble getting the link for the mental health um seminar this afternoon working on the chat um nick or marilyn do you reckon you could try and pop it up for us here when you 've got a second thanks excellent thanks andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by with a short acknowledgement of country so council acknowledges the cooling nation for their custodianship and management of these lands and waterways that that i for one am speaking on today and most of us will be coming to you from the lands um and waterways of the kulin nation although lindel and some other people may be coming from somewhere else and we acknowledge these first nations enduring connection and their elders that pass these practices and wisdom across generations all right so we 're going to start officially and first up today we have the newport community choir now hobsons may have been celebrating world migratory bird day since 2014 and from the beginning the newport community choir has supported the rangers in getting the word out and building awareness for the migratory birds that visit our wetlands every summer at our first world migratory bird day the choir appeared over the crest of the hill in newport lakes park singing about the eastern kuru a flash mob that brought smiles to the friends group who were elbow deep in mud at the in mulch at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share the screen in a minute the first image will show uh just a picture like a photograph of the choir gathering in the car park with their banner just before the event and this year 2020 will be the seventh year that the choir has lent its voice to our celebrations but this year in the light of covert 19 and the restrictions i 've had to find another way to sing so what i 'm about to share with you is the newport community virtual choir each member has recorded their part individually and then thanks to the amazing technical skills of kerry saxby one of the choir 's tenors it has been edited into a wonderful whole and this endeavor was supported by the hobsons bay community fund and the newport community choir is a group within the newport fiddle and folk club currently the choir meets weekly on a wednesday evening on zoom for a sing-along the choir founder and leader ellen davies welcomes all voices no audition necessary so if you 'd like to join in the singing please visit the club website and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post the website up on the chat for you all it 's nwfc.org.eu now just a little note when i when i play the the video it will start with a silent photograph and then it will go into the video you may need to turn your own volume up on your computer if you 're finding it a little quiet just so you know my my volume all my volume functions are at a hundred percent so if you 're finding it a little quiet you 'll probably have to turn it up on your own end depending on the quality of everyone 's internet the video may not be as clear as we would like so if it didn 't come through that well to you andrew is going to put up a copy of the youtube link on the chat so you can copy that and view it at your leisure at another time or just play it again to enjoy it another time so without further ado here they are once again launching world migratory bird day with a song the music and lyrics are by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace [Music] behind you [Music] is [Applause] oh [Music] thousands and thousands [Music] [Applause] thousands is [Music] wasn 't that incredible even even uh if you did if even if your video and sound did play that well for you i highly recommend you check it out again it 's so fantastic and on behalf of the members of um our team here at hobson 's bay we really thank the newport community choir your support your ongoing support means so much to us now coming up now is a short video it 's only about two minutes long and it features the late clive minton whose name has become synonymous with shorebird conservation in australia and around the world you may find it a little wobbly beaming this via zoom but clive says it all and we thought it was well worth sharing once again andrew is going to put the link up in the chat in case you 'd like to view it later now this video was initially posted by millie formby a zoologist pilot artist and adventurer millie met clive on her first bird banding expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passionate advocate for the birds in 2022 she plans to fly around australia visiting schools and spreading the shorebird word try say that 's try saying that three times fast the shawbird word if you wish to participate all the information is on her website um which andrew can post up in the chat it 's wingthreads.com so let 's hope we see million in hobson 's bay in a couple of years if not before um we 're going to put up a copy of the youtube video link of the video we 're about to to show on the chat as well as millie 's website so if you 'd like to watch it again or share it with friends obviously feel free to do that here we go well here we are in the middle of the wet season on the north coast of western australia it may look pretty bleak for us today but to the 500 000 migratory wading birds that live on 80 ml beach this is just heaven they have evolved to be able to migrate a round trip of 20 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to the arctic stay up there four or six weeks while they breed and then all the way back again we 've been banding them now for nearly 40 years and we find the same individuals coming back year after year two days ago we had a catch of red knot one of those birds born in 1997 is in its 20th year it was migrated to the antique and back 18 times in that period so that bird that we captured two days ago uh has flown just on migration alone more than the distance from the earth to the moon now that 's a little bird the size of my fist a hundred grams think how big a engine it needs to take man up to the moon this little magic bird can do that all on its own just by feeding in a really rich resource the flyweight like a chain with links in it these stop over points and if you break a leak by that stopover area not being an adequate resource then you are going to greatly interrupt the whole of the migration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time i hear clive talking about how far that that one little bird has flown in its lifetime oh yeah can you hear that on i 've got sound in my house sorry about that um so now i 'm go we 're going to hear from lindle kidd so lindell feel free to turn thanks you 're ahead of me lindell 's a shorebird biologist currently working for birdlife australia and she just let us know that she 's actually streaming from west australia right now which had me the one feeling very very jealous um and lindell has spent seven years monitoring breeding shorebirds in the arctic circle today she 'll be giving us an introduction to migratory shorebirds basically what they are and where do they go birdlife australia has been a great supporter of ours over the years and it 's really great to have you back again lindell this year so thanks so much for presenting and i 'll hand it over to you just make sure you unmute yourself as well wonderful thank you so much for having me i 'll just um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful to be speaking on my absolute favorite topic which is of course uh shoppers and migratory shorebirds so thanks for having me um can everyone see my screen wonderful so we keep talking about shorebirds most most of you probably know and i 'm going to start at the very beginning what actually is a shorebird generally as you might have guessed by their name they live out the shore except if they don 't they usually have long bills well except if they don 't and they 've got short legs except if they haven 't so when we talk about sugars we 're actually talking about an artificial group of birds and they 're usually associated with wetland habitats there 's over 200 species worldwide and they all belong to the same sort of taxonomic scientific order which i 'm not going to try and pronounce however gulls and turns which aren 't shorebirds also belong to this taxonomic order so generally when i explain to people what a shorebird is i say a bird that runs along the shoreline and that 's because they 're actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are a bit more of a sea bird they might actually feed and fish out over the ocean or they might actually land on the ocean whereas a shorebird won 't do that it 's feeding in the shoreline it rests on the shoreline hence the name and often people call these birds waders and they 'll use those terms interchangeably so we 've got two types of shorebirds with us here in australia and unfortunately we 're not going to give these guys too much attention these are our resident shorebirds they don 't migrate anywhere they actually rely on australia 's shorelines and wetlands to breed so we 're like enough to have them with us year round and as a general rule these guys are a little more brightly colored and perhaps a little bit more gregarious in their behavior so some of you may be familiar with the one in the top left the mast black wing or masked plover with the yellow face which is quite common in some urban habitats but today we 're here to celebrate our migratory shorebirds and as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brown or gray in color and a little more discreet you may not notice them at first if you 're in their habitat along beaches and coastlines now i like to say there 's always one exception to every rule and that is the ruddy turnstone in the bottom middle and you 'll notice that this bird has sort of more brightly colored orange legs even when it 's here with us in australia now shorebirds actually occupy an incredible variety of wetland habitat ranging from freshwater lakes inland uh even to filled grassland plains inland salt lakes rocky shores sandy beaches but usually our migratory sugars hang out on these intertidal sort of mud and sand flats or coastal habitat areas we 're so lucky in this country we 're very very rich in shorebirds so we have 18 residents that rely on our wetlands to breed we have 37 different migratory shorebird species that regularly visit this country and in addition we can have uh vagrant birds blowing from different flyways and i 'll explain what i mean there um further on the thing to keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birds in the whole world and those declines are actually true right here in australia so two of our resident shorebird species are listed under our environmental protection biodiversity act which is our threatened species act and seven of our migratory species are listed now that 's a huge percentage of our migratory species right here in australia some of you may have noticed a little eight in that bracket there and that 's because one of these species is actually split into two separate subspecies it 's a biotel godwin and it 's got different subspecies pretty much on the east and west northern coasts so i would actually love for everyone to take a look at this bird and if you 're feeling confident maybe you can type into the chat and have a guess at what this bird is called all right i 've had some funny guesses before like bruce or magdaler or all sorts of things i 'm going to tell you i 'm not sure if anyone got it that this bird is actually a red knot now who thinks that that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how about now the name starts to make a little bit more sense so this is actually a red knot in its breeding plumage and hence the name this is what a red knot looks like when it visits us in australia and actually there was a red knot in that video just shown of clive minton so i like to say we 're sort of only getting half of the picture um we 're missing this uh sort of journey when they 're not here with us in australia and they change their sort of feather patterns and colors so where do they go i keep saying you know they 're migrating away this is an example of australia 's smallest migratory shorebird a redneck stint which actually weighs less than a mars bar about as much as a fun-sized mars bar and you can see in the orange in the northern hemisphere the breeding habitat for this species so it 's arctic siberia and in it in the winter this bird will come down to australia now of course uh winter and summer are on opposite schedules in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the northern hemisphere by joining us for our summer but i 'll get into those dates in a minute so how do they get there that 's a long way to go they have a little bit of help they use what i like to call um a bird highway these migratory flyaways and there 's lots of different flyways across the globe they usually follow sort of wind tunnels but we 're lucky because we are in without doubt the absolute best of all of the flyways the east asian australasian flyway a little bit of a mouthful the reason this fly away is the best is because it is the busiest for birds we have over six million shorebirds that will use this flyweight every year and it 's a business for birds but it 's also the busiest for people so it crosses over 22 countries and nearly half the world 's population actually lives within this flyway so it stretches from the southern boundary of new zealand all the way up to arctic siberia northern china and arctic alaska and as i mentioned 37 birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 000 kilometers to complete the round trip and then they 'll head all the way back again now remember i did say there 's always one exception to every rule and most of our species head to the northern hemisphere except we have one called the double-banded plover now this operates on a different schedule to the northern hemisphere migrants and it flies between australia and new zealand where it breeds so why are they heading to the arctic this is an aerial photograph of where they 're heading in summer the sort of snow and ice melts off the tundra and forms this mosaic of wetland habitat and these pools spill out over because there 's a permafrost permanently under the ground and they 're going there to have chicks and the reason for that is because there is an absolute abundance of food when they get there so imagine all of those wetland pools basically absolutely teeming with invertebrate lava and that 's what they 'll raise their cheeks on it 's like 24 hours a day during the summer so it 's incredibly productive period but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arctic they 'll arrive toward the end of may start displaying and setting up their territory pretty much pair up immediately begin to lay incubate the brood it will hatch between after 21 to 28 days depending on the species and then they 'll pretty much feed like crazy try and build up to fly all the way back down to australia in just six weeks so of course as it 's like 24 hours a day and incredibly productive it starts to get dark 24 hours a day when it gets winter up there and completely inhospitable for sure birds and now it starts to make sense why they change color or they swap their plumage they put on their breeding plumage i would say and that 's because they actually perfectly match the arctic tundra and whilst they 're here on our shores with that brown gray color they generally do also tend to blend in with our coastal habitats their nests directly on the ground and their nests match the camouflage of the tundra perfectly as do their adorable chicks now they have some pretty incredible physiological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with the chicks just for about three weeks after they hatch and then they 'll actually head down the flyway back to australia leaving those chicks behind so when the chicks have just hatched at about six to seven weeks old they 've got to leave the arctic circle and fly unaided all the way back down to australia so we get a little bit of a different wave of arrivals when we 're looking at our migratory shorebirds here we 'll have adults here right now starting from september through to october and the juveniles will arrive a little bit later so from november and they 'll generally stay all the way through until march now some of these juveniles arrive and i think they think i am not turning around and going back there i just got here are you serious so they may well actually spend one full year with us in australia so you can actually see migratory shorebirds all year round and of course you can also see that double banded plumber which is on the opposite schedule and it is actually here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly different migratory strategy but they all use this east asian australasian fly away and the graph on the left just so shows some of the flight paths and some different types of shorebirds will take through the yellow arrows and i want you to just have a good look at this big straight arrow that stretches from alaska down to the east coast of australia and if you 're watching the little video on the right hand side which i 'll just get to play again you will notice that these little dots are um stints that were caught in australia 's uh north west and they put the geolocators on them and they can actually watch them as they tracked all the way up through to the flyway to the breeding grounds and then you 'll notice them coming back down again so that straight arrow that stretched directly from alaska to australia is the flight path of my favorite bird a bartow god witch and this is it dressed up in its breeding plumage now these birds um i have an incredible migration and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries in the way to get back from the arctic to australia they actually fly directly over the pacific ocean now you often hear of sea birds and albatross that fly all over the world so perhaps that doesn 't sound as epic as it is to you but remember that i said that sea birds actually stop and rest on the ocean and shore birds don 't that means that this bird about the size of a football or a little smaller will fly non-stop for over nine days constantly flapping its wings that entire time it doesn 't stop to eat and indeed it doesn 't stop to sleep and they 're not even sure how it 's physiologically possible they think it might switch off half its brain while flying or do little micro sleeps or all sorts of things now these birds are actually very long-lived and can live for over 30 years which means that in their lifetime they fly well and truly the distance to the moon and back because they 're covering you know 24 25 000 kilometer round trip every year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now unfortunately i did say that migratory shorebirds are declining um and a lot of the threats they face occur um within the yellow sea area so one of the major threats to this group of birds is habitat reclamation uh they stop oversights along the way they need to stop and refuel before they can make it to australia and unfortunately a lot of the sort of coastal mud flights on which they rely are being cleared and developments being put on them however i just want to reiterate the importance of australia for these shorebirds so absolutely australia is provides absolutely critical habitat for our shorebirds in our flyway and this simple example of a small uh lagoon in gippsland 400 hectares at 1.4 000 redneck scents were counted in that area now 80 000 hectares of tundra would be required to support 4 000 rednecks in and of course they 're using the habitat in a very different way they 're feeding here so they can go back to breed and they 're all spread out when they 're on the breeding grounds but you really start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to conserve that 400 hectare lagoon in victoria they 're also with us for the majority of their lives they can be with us for up to six months of any given year in australia compared to that short six-week snippet when they 're on the tundra so i like to say that in australia we 're really looking after these birds on behalf of the rest of the world and also our resident species of course rely on our wetlands and beaches year-round to breed so they 're absolutely dependent on us and like our arctic nesters they will actually lay their eggs directly on the sand and they 're often breeding on our beaches during our summer which is of course the most time of high use now port phillip bay indeed is especially important for shorebirds these sites are known shortbread count areas from a long-term monitoring program and actually internationally significant numbers of populations of migratory shorebirds occur at many of these sites that means that at any one of these sites a certain percentage of the whole global population can be found relying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole stretch of coastline within the hobsons bay area and they do face many threats here sometimes i hear people say to me well what can i do about the decline of shorebirds in the yellow sea area there is actually a lot that you can do firstly we don 't really have it in order here in australia either where we 're still developing their habitat right now one of our internationally listed ramsar sites that provides habitat for two or three critically endangered species is actually up for development right now in queensland where they 're going to clear um the wetland and potentially put a block of apartments on it so that 's tunde harbour in queensland and you can have a look about i would encourage you to have a look read and get some further information about that but indeed closer to home shorebirds still face major threats mostly through disturbance whilst they 're here they 've got to triple their body weight to make that migratory journey up so they 're pretty much spending all of their time just feeding frantically on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas where we love to hang out so they 're threatened by people going about their business recreationally potentially boating fishing if you 're four wheel driving on the beach and the number one disturbance especially in this area would be um dogs off leash or um dogs that actually chase the shorebird so always be mindful to just keep a safe distance and let the birds feed and get on with it so how can you help these declining amazing species if you 're a birder you can join our shorebird count we do uh biannual censuses of the population pretty much at all wetland sites around the whole of australia and i 'm proud to say that that program has actually guided international policy because we have the most some of the most comprehensive data on these bird populations in this country for the whole flyway so in terms of a citizen science project to get involved with it 's a pretty good one it can have global impact with your data of course reducing disturbance in coastal estuaries and habitats especially following dog leashing requirements and guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat just following appropriate um boat user or four-wheel drive guidance but absolutely what you need to do is help spread the word about the existence of these birds so what you 're doing right now is perfect celebrating them through a world migratory birthday event consider sharing information with your family and friends and potentially even hosting an event yourself now i thought i would take the opportunity to quickly run through a couple of what i 'm going to call the usual suspects the ones that you 're likely to see close to you and i know that later on andrew is going to go into some more detail about where you can actually find the specific shorebirds in your area but we did already mention the redneck stip which is the smallest of australia 's migratory shorebirds it 's about the size of a sparrow and when it 's with us it 's sort of gray brown all over it 's got a short black fill and short black legs and these ones actually occur all the way around australia another common one you may see is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sort of streamlined effect body size or body shape and this one has sort of more green yellowy legs and it often has a rusty red colored head and motley plumage now these guys can actually be found around the whole coastline as well as an inland wetlands and sort of hiding infringing vegetation and again they 're pretty much found around the whole of australia now this one you may remember from the first slide this one is a little bit more obvious and i like to think it looks a bit like a bird sort of dressed up in a tuxedo so this is a ruddy turn stone and you 'll see these orange legs and a bit more um brightly colored even whilst it 's here with us in australia and again this one can be around at all the whole of australia and often these species will be in mixed flocks because they all um they eat slightly different things but they all feed on the same habitat so it allows them to sort of co-occur and you can usually tell what a shortbread eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is helpful if you 're trying to identify them and i 'm going to finish with our curly sand piper now this one is a critically endangered bird and it 's especially um relies on areas around port phillip bay for habitat so this one is recognizable because it has a longer sort of down curved bill it is quite a small bird it 's a little bit bigger than the redneck stint but a little bit smaller than the sharp tail sand piper and again these birds are cruising all the way up to arctic siberia and the northern hemisphere to breathe before gracing us with their presence in our wetlands so i just want to say thank you to multiple shorebird conservation partners involved in our bird life australia monitoring program as well as to our account volunteers who help us collect an invaluable conservation data for these species and that 's actually it from me so um we 're going to throw over in a minute to kate goring smith who is a melbourne based artist with a long history of using art to engage communities with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade kate has initiated three group art projects with this aim at their core her current project over wintering project mapping sanctuary was opened as part of the 2019 hobson 's bay world migratory bird day celebrations at the louis joel art gallery in altona as some of you may have seen that last year the exhibition featured the work of many local artists and was the result of three months of print workshops at the wood street art space in leviton as well as numerous site visits to watch shorebirds along the altona foreshore in 2019 kate also was artist in resident at point cook college where she worked with teachers and students on art projects related to the local migratory shorebird habitat of point cook and the western treatment plant kate has also been a part of the last five years world migratory bird day celebrations in hobson 's bay bringing her miniature printing press for people of all ages to make prince of shore birds some of some of you may have participated in that in previous years and kate is also the vice president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art project aimed to celebrate and publicize the east asian australasian flyway and our migratory shorebirds the project involved 20 artists from nine of the 23 flyway countries since its inaugural exhibition in 2014 the flyway print exchange has been viewed by over 4 000 people in exhibitions throughout australia as well as in singapore hong kong indonesia and new zealand so it really brings together the almost the entire flyway and in her presentation kate will discuss this project and how art can engage people with the flyway and our migratory shorebirds so we 'll pass over to you kate just make sure you 're off mute and your videos on do i share my screen okay sorry um sorry i 'm just i 'm getting distracted um but thank you thank you so much for that suzette and um thank you for inviting me to be here um it 's it 's wonderful to be here today with everybody to celebrate world migratory bird day and um i 'm just that bar so that i can get to my um sorry can i just ask her a technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the screen share the the full screen bit of my powerpoint presentation there 's a black uh like bar that 's got the mute and the video one and everything can i remove that um i don 't believe you can but um i think if you uh so you 're impact are you in powerpoint yes i think if you press your little um icon down the bottom left hand corner of your screen it will launch your presentation and i think that will be fine and we we 're not seeing the bar does that answer your question great so yes with everybody 's got that uh we can see it inside of powerpoint so see see um say right down the bottom um of your screen there 's a there 's a little box that looks like yeah and go across two oh there that one hit that one that should yeah now we 're seeing it okay ready to go yes so thank you so much for having me here today and um so i started this i initiated this art project because i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea and also a really important idea for i think the current age we live in where we can forget that we 're part of a united global ecology that 's much much more ancient than the the maps we 're used to looking at which are covered of course with lines and borders and um but we have to remember that to the birds that use the flyway they don 't have those borders they just have been following those paths that are instinctively built into them for thousands if if not millions of years um and so birds the theme of today 's is world my greatest bird day is birds connect the world and and they really do and they 've been doing that for so long and they connect it both through space by joining up those countries i always think of the um the list of of countries on the um on the flyway which i 'll just read out to you they 're almost like points on a on a necklace like precious stopping points and um as as lindel said and as clive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical to their continued existence and so we have that we have that obligation to um to be wise stewards of the land for the birds to continue flying but i also like to think that the birds have been flying um they connect us through time as well because of course um you know i think of the birds flying while the great wall of china was being built while you know through history through those ancient times um those same birds following those same paths it 's it 's a lovely poetic idea the idea of the flyway as well as being a strong scientific you know truth um so the flyway countries are new zealand of course the most southerly ones in australia papua new guinea timor indonesia brunei singapore malaysia india bangladesh myanmar cambodia thailand laos vietnam the philippines japan south korea north korea china mongolia and finally up the top russia and alaska the us in the usa of course and in this project i 'll show you the prints of the project i had 20 artists from nine of the flyway countries i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them i didn 't know but i contacted them all by emailing printmaking workshops throughout the flyway and i ended up with the artists who were involved who i 'll introduce you to and the beautiful thing is that most of them i never met i still haven 't met and this was such an act of of generosity that they produce these beautiful prints for us all to enjoy today so i 'll just take you through them so this is a little mosaic of all the prints from the project um so we start in in australia of course uh this is a photo from roebuck bay and you can see that the um a lot of the birds are in there breeding plumage and then i 'll take you right through to alaska where the birds are headed on this journey through art so we begin with celia walker from new zealand and her print is called te kuaka because kawaka is the maori name for the bar tailed godwit which as lindel said was her favorite and it 's also my favorite uh migratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you think about it the shorebirds except in siberia and alaska where their nests are very hard to find these birds would arrive with the summer and then they would leave and it was a great mystery as to where they were going and you 'd never find their nests so where they bred how they bred all of these things were a mystery so there 's some very very old stories um from a multitude of cultures along the flyway about the birds and i know that the maori had had two stories that i know of and probably more um about the godwit the kawaka and one was that um they brought the maori people to the islands of new zealand in the first place that they followed the birds but the other story is that when the birds left as the winds were becoming colder and as the winter was coming they took the spirits of the dead with them on their journeys so that 's very beautiful um then uh so we 've moved slightly further north along with the journey we 're going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art um this is a friend of mine helen coaches edwards who 's another melbourne printmaker and she 's put if you see she 's used a melway uh page the map page for melbourne as part of the bird 's body and that 's indicating that the birds have these maps that are ingrained in their you know in their biology um and that enables the little chicks to to travel for the first time without having an adult bird to follow when they come south and this little bird has been everywhere and on its journey it 's picked up key rings souvenirs for everywhere it 's been so it 's got the panda from china and the kiwi from new zealand and the um the moose from alaska and so that 's helen 's way of talking about the migratory shorebird this is my print which is based on a very old map of the sky the milky way and if you look very closely some of those stars are actually birds and i 've always been quite fascinated with the um well the fact that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fly through the night they can navigate by the stars and they 've well they think and so some of my stars are actually birds that have become part of the night sky uh this is a print by alexis beckett who 's another um victorian artist and um hers was inspired also by the flight of the birds and you can see that the birds are part of the clouds um you know so that they 've become an integral part of the sky as well and vita pearson 's done a very beautiful and very accurate depiction of tarik sandpipers and she 's another victorian artist now oh there 's vida so you 'll notice that all of these works of prince i 'm a printmaker prince are a form of art that can be produced in multiples so i actually had everybody printed uh each print was printed 30 times um and each artist actually got a set of all the prints that 's what the word exchange means in the context of this project because we were exchanging prints so it actually it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prints and that creates a little community of artists as well because we 've each got a copy of each other 's works and that 's why they 're pulling a print on her printing press so we will all have printed that prints in a similar way to uc vita working there amanda 's is a lovely print it 's it always reminds me a little bit of a pop art andy warhol kind of print um she was inspired by the way uh if you watch a flock of shorebirds and they turn into the light and they can almost appear and disappear and the birds in the top half of that print are printed in silver and when you hold the print up to the light they will actually appear and disappear because they 're shiny in their silver so it 's a very clever depiction of that and the way the birds move and there 's amanda working in her studio in brisbane so we 're heading farther north and that 's her edition now where i was very very lucky to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burulula in the northern territory and this is gret 's picture which was great because it 's the only picture that really shows the birds on the um on the mud flats feeding in a flock and coming in to land um and the artists up in in walunga were um they worked with some people from charles darwin university to make these lovely prints this is by sharon also from the northern territory it 's an eastern curve but it also has the traditional name there which i 'm not going to try and pronounce and finally violet hammer um and violet 's print is a liner cut of the ruddy tone stone which we 've seen from photos of lindles and it was printed on ochre the brown that 's the the backing is the traditional ochre which is used in a lot of indigenous art in australia and um you can see it comes through it kind of blooms through the the white ink to create each of the prints is quite unique because of that reaction um okay i think we 're ready to leave australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made this wonderful wood cut called the wader and you can see like he works very um much more physically you can see those strokes he 's made as he 's cut the image out of the um the print there and there he is working away and then now we 're up to singapore uh where please stand this actually was very exciting this is the first print that poison ever made it 's a liner cut that he hand coloured and puisan has become a friend of jackie karen 's and mine and he 's been to visit us here so again making connections along the flyway that 's his original um drawing for the the print uh that 's the um the vinyl that he cut into to make his lino cut i thought you might be interested to see some of the process images as well and there he is and his hand coloring them at home it 's a big job now we 're in india and this was by the youngest uh participant in the flower print exchange radhika and she made a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe for love following their hearts and um so that was another it everybody was invited to respond to the idea of the fly away and it 's just was really lovely to see how each artist had a completely different take on it as well and this is kavita shah who 's the other indian artist and um as you 'll see hers are based on the traditional hana henna patterns of um the bride the indian bride and i like to think that this print is about how we all have to hold hands to make one chain along the flyway to protect these birds we all have to help each other and now we 're up to china i 've got three artists who came from china feng jiang ming um the first here his beautiful picture is almost you know captures the magic of how the birds um defy our own imaginations to pass from one hemisphere to the other every single year uh xiaohua who i 'm still in touch with this is another beautiful moody print um there 's a just a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description translated into chinese in order to get artists from china and when i was sent their prints and i saw this one in particular which you can see it 's geese it 's not a shore bird and i was said to my husband oh it 's not they 're not sure birds they 're geese what am i gonna do and he just said calm down calm down this is an art project it 's okay so i got a bit of perspective but and it 's a beautiful image and this you can see it 's an etching so this is a print that 's made in metal and pressed into the the paper to transfer the ink onto the paper and there he is he 's signing his prince and he 's got his gloves on so that he keeps the prince lovely and pristine and clean uh lastly new jian ming who i think is the eldest person in the flower print exchange uh his was a wood water print um and there 's a close-up the cutting his plate which you can see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he had a he had a small accident he ended up in hospital so he 's sitting up in his hospital bed signing the prince um junta lee is my artist from south korea and this i 'm very very fond of this print it 's very very minimalist but what he told me so he 's done a lino cut for the blue at the bottom and then he 's just had that little letterpress stamp that says birds with the stamp and in each print so in each of the 30 prints that word and the little arrow is in a different spot on the print and he said to me that that is his experience of bird watching the little arrow is pointing to the point at which he stopped being able to see the bird so the bird goes he watches it and watches it and watches it and it finally disappears so that 's what that little that 's the story of that print and there he is working away um kyoko imazu is actually she 's based in melbourne but she 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here where they 've got i don 't know if you would have been there um but you can go and they 've got the room with all the um a lot of specimens that are taxidermied so she actually drew this eastern curly from a taxidermied specimen at the um the melbourne museum but i like to think that she completely brought it back to life because it 's got that sparkle in its eye and it looks curious and it looks engaged so it 's such a lovely image and again it 's an etching and that 's showing so she was drawing them that 's showing the drawings that she made of the bird that then she turned into prints that 's drawings on the plates the etching plates now finally here we are we made it all the way out the flyway up to alaska and this is a silk screen print by gary collits who was the head of printmaking up at the museum the university of anchorage and you 'll you can see the big s where the birds have come in to land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print just is chillier than any of the other prints in the um the flower print exchange and it just has that hint of maybe the winter 's starting to come back and the birds are getting ready to go they 're getting restless they 're getting ready to fly off and lastly finally uh ed miguel i 've got his print uh ed 's mother uh was uh he 's was i 'm not sure a member of the inupiat so an indigenous uh american uh and so that 's its heritage and i think that this uh image depicts the indigenous way of life people going out in their kayaks up in the chile um alaskan waters she was from cape uh point hope uh up in alaska which i believe for a long time could only be reached by water um so they were probably very dependent on there on their coast for um you know food and their livelihood and this is a lovely image of the the person in the kayak and the birds flying past the moon through the sky so that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a part of the flyway print exchange to represent the bird 's journeys what i did was we we posted one of each print without any covering all the way up the flyway and back so it started um i sent them to cecilia walker who was in new zealand she posted them to tampui san in singapore and he posted them up to gary collett 's in alaska who then posted them back to me in melbourne so if you go to an exhibition of the flower print exchange you 'll actually see two sets of prints you 'll see the prints that we call the pristine prints and they 're framed and then you 'll see the prints that are the traveled prints which are unframed because um it 's nice to be able to see the back and the front of these prints and they 've got stamps and they 've been folded and they often have sticky tape um and they 've got addresses that have been rubbed out and rewritten and the thing is the birds can 't come into the gallery and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince are standing in for the birds they 've done that journey i was kind of hoping one might get lost so that you know i could have a cautionary tale but they did all come back um and yeah and i think that when people visit the exhibition the pristine prints are lovely and they 're very beautiful pieces of art but the travel prints are kind of intriguing so that 's and there 's um one of the other travel prints so you can see it 's kind of fascinating because it 's it 's got wear and tear and the layers of meaning which is really nice um so that 's the end of the story i just wanted to read you a quote if that 's okay maybe i 'll stop that said all right maybe i 'll get rid of that and it can come back oops does it come back to me anyway um it doesn 't really matter but i 'll i 'll leave you on that to enjoy while i read this quote which i did send to each artist and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called invisible connections which was published by the csiro invisible connections why migrating shorebirds need the yellow sea and i 'll just read it quickly from a human perspective australia australasia and the country stretching along the pacific rim are already connected in important ways by history and commerce alliances and agreements less frequently however do we consider the ecological connections between these nations spun by the dramatic journeys of migratory birds their globe-spanning flights link countries separated by thousands of kilometers as well as those separated by ideology language and culture in a world where diplomacy can seem a daunting challenge jesus fly readily from country to country with dependence on all but allegiance to none a feather groan to grace the breast of a godwit in new zealand may someday be used to line the nest of a tundra dwelling songbird near the bering sea tiny grains of stony detritus washed down from the highlands of central china may frame the burrow of a mud dwelling

by the borders drawn on our two-dimensional maps these feathered travelers remind us that we are connected in ways more profound and substantive than those set forth in the carefully crafted phrases of treaty and trade so there we are thank you so much um now but now i would love to introduce matt mcarthur so matt mcarthur sorry about someone tuning in there oh he 's waving there he is matt macarthur has a quarter of century experience studying marine systems with a particular focus on the small invertebrates that live in the sand and mud based in altona matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antarctic history matt migrates south each austral suburb to work in antarctica you 're going in the opposite direction of the birds mat however he still finds time to come and help us out each my each world migratory bird day and today he 's on the hunt for the same marine invertebrates the waiter birds are after when they visit our shores so without further ado matt i 'll hand it over to you thanks thank you so much suzette uh as suzette mentioned my interest in marine systems goes back to childhood i would visit the beach with my family and look into the rock pools and find interesting animals and sometimes i 'd recognize them i 'd seen snails before but i hadn 't seen snails eating other animals predators were a new thing to me so that really caught my my attention at the age of seven or eight and then looking a bit further afield i 'd see animals that i had no idea about so things like bivalves scallops and mussels and oysters don 't have any analog on land so i was seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups of animals i hadn 't seen before and i put on a mask and snorkel and i went a bit further afield outside the outside the rock pools and i started seeing animals that just had no connection matt um matt i 'm afraid we 're losing you um i 'm not sure if you can do anything do anything about your internet there but um sorry see that yeah we we just lost you a whole lot you came back in on i think echinoderms if i got that name correctly i 'm not i think it 's at your end i think the internet might be a little bit in and out i 'm not sure if there 's anything you can do about that okay you just check that i 'm unmuted please yep we can hear you you 're unmuted okay so i would put on my mask and snorkel and go snorkeling and see animals that i had no idea about animals like echinoderms which are the sea stars and the sea cucumbers and sorry sea urchins which have no connection to animals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mask and snorkel was like visiting an alien world and it still is 40 years on putting on a mask and snorkel at the beach is one of the most exciting things that i ever get to do so i got into a career in marine science mostly because of that interest in the the invertebrates the smaller things and my connection to world migratory bird day feels very personal because i 'm i 'm just going to tilt my camera down now and show you my tray i was trying to get a third camera working and it 's just not on the go um i chase the same sort of things that the birds come here to eat so this is what i 've been working with for the last 25 years trays and trays of sediment brought up from the sea floor and i pick over this with my forceps and i pull out the little tiny crustaceans and worms and mollusks that live down in this sediment that the birds are here to feed on so well that i went out on the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now and see what we can find in my tray so i 'm just going to highlight my microscope so that should now be showing you the close-up view of my tray i 'm seeing susette nodding so i 'll start picking over that and see what sort of invertebrates we can find these are the things that the birds are looking for and hopefully we 'll see the animals themselves but we 'll also see the trace of the animals that the birds might follow if they 're if they 're looking for these things sometimes they 're a little clues to where they 're living little trails or burrow burrow entrances i 'll try and move this slowly so you don 't get too seasick you can see some sea grass here seagrass is a plant that has an evolutionary history on land they are a flowering plant so they are separate to all of the algae in the sea which are we call them plants but they 're more closely related to bacteria this is a true vascular plant and it does flower so it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just recolonizing back into the sea and it 's only found in the shallows because it needs lots of sunlight to make the food that it uses which then acts as food for other other animals not many animals can actually digest sea grass the local swans are about the only species that can eat this stuff directly and even then they can only eat the very very freshest growing growing past manatees and dugongs up in the tropics will eat it but locally it 's mostly providing habitat for other organisms there are plants that live on or algae that live on the sea grass and animals that live down amongst the seagrass it 's providing habitat over a soft sediment so where there would otherwise just be sand and mud two-dimensional habitat it 's consolidating the sediment it prevents it from getting washed around in the wind and waves as much as it otherwise would and the plant the the algae that grow on the sea grass can then act as food for grazing snails and other species and that 's where the protein starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plant and the plant acting as a substrate for animals to feed on their algae and to live amongst with a bit of protection from the predatory fish so that third dimension is almost like a forest the little animals with their very keen eyesight and they 're very pointy peaks or bills and sift these animals out and here 's our first little candidate let 's just get that one under the camera where are we there we go a little grazing snail now that would be about five millimeters from side to side it 's got an operculum at the entrance to close the animal in and protect it from predators but it 's not got a thick enough shell to protect it from any sort of wading bird a lot of wading birds are able to pick these things open even the larger specimens but in this in this case it 's actually small enough to fit down the down the throat of most of the wading birds that we get visiting so that would be eaten whole and digested perhaps broken up by the crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar from the grazing snails that we have on land see if i can find a predatory snail for us the birds don 't much care about what they eat so long as they eat a lot of it these animals are really small so it takes a lot to fill up an animal 's stomach and give it give it the energy that it needs to make that huge journey back to the north again or in the case of the arctic terns that come visiting all the way down to antarctica and then back up to the arctic not a huge amount of action this is actually quite a coarse sediment i i went straight down greave parade from my home today and sampled in the high tide very close to shore because my gun boots were about to get over top so this was really close to the to the beach where it 's been replenished with um fairly coarse sediment and i was using a one millimeter sieve for my collection so i don 't get all the muddy silty stuff that would then block up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snails there 's a trick with marine snails telling whether they 're a grazer or a predator that was taught to me by mark rodrigue who i know from my days down at queen 's cliff he was at the marine discovery center when i was working at mafri and it 's called soup bowls and gravy boats it 's really cool if a snail has a round aperture to its shell that looks like a salad bowl it is probably a grazing snail it 's probably a vegetarian if it 's got a little flute on the side of its shell that looks like you could pour gravy out of it it 's probably a predator that little flute is where the animal will stick its proboscis a little a little tube of flesh coming off its off its um front and it will use that proboscis to give itself a directional sense of smell it can you can sniff to the left and to the right and work out where the best smelling meat is so soup bowls and gravy boats was a great boon to my sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach so this is one of the soup bowl ones i won 't bother it and roll it over i want to get some of these animals back to the beach later on and release them and i don 't want them to be too stressed so i 'm trying to keep the water cool and keep replenishing it every couple of minutes just to keep the oxygen up to them you can see they 've got little fleshy lobes coming out to the front they are using a bit of a directional sense of smell but they 're not hunting they 're just grazing you can see them working over the sediments there some of these snails won 't go to the sea grass to get their algae that they want to chew up and digest they 'll just graze it directly off the sediment port phillips a very shallow body of water for its for its surface area and a lot of the productivity a lot of the a lot of the um photosynthesis that goes on in port phillip is happening on the surface of the sediment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit deeper it would largely be in the phytoplankton in the animals living in the water column itself and that 's part of what makes port phillip such a a huge weight point for these waiter birds it 's got tremendous shallow waters where the productivity is happening on the surface of the sediment so the secondary productivity the the conversion from plant matter or photosynthetic matter to protein in animal form is happening in those shallow sediments so there 's this tremendous wealth of food really close to the surface that the birds can access it 's not unique in the world but it 's the reason that we have a ramstar site just kilometers from my home we are really privileged to be such a huge waypoint for these birds and that we have so many species visiting here i 'm going to dig down a bit now and see what 's going on beneath the surface we treat the surface sediments in port phillip mostly as a two-dimensional surface when we go snorkeling we we swim over it and it looks like a flat paddock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous amount of life going on beneath that circuit these animals probably make up more biomass in port phillip than all of the dolphins and snapper and flathead and nudibranchs put together there 's more soft sediment habitat import phillip than any other sort of habitat and there 's more biodiversity and more biomass in the sediments than there is swimming around free in the water even when you take into account those right whales and humpback whales that came into the bay that 's a big lump of lump of protein in a single animal but compared to the number of heart urchins and mollusks burrowing around in this sediment um it just pales in comparison so the birds are onto a winner coming into port phillip waters and feeding up the way that they do i 'm not seeing a lot of worms in this course sediment i think i must have filtered them all out at the half millimeter scale but fortunately i 've got some pr some that i prepared earlier so i 'll switch over from my sorting tray to some of my petri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seawater today i might actually put that on a white background hang on there we go now in that tray we 've got you know switching back to highlight that video okay this tray is almost entirely amphipod crustaceans the flattened laterally flattened crustaceans that make up the bulk of the biomass in amongst the seagrass so these animals aren 't eating the sea grass they 're eating plants and animals that live on the seagrass they move really quickly when they want to so the birds that are feeding on these animals have to have really good eyesight and be really adept at stabbing with their beak to catch these things species like flamingos are able to filter little tiny crustaceans out of the water on mass they 've almost got a filter feeding mechanism similar to a whale going on with their very specific structure in their bill i think the spoonbills are doing something similar but there are other species that have to have to grab these animals one at a time so they 've got to have good eyesight and they 've got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing so you can see these are crustaceans they 've got the the segmented body like an insect they 're part of the arthropoda along with insects and arachnids the difference between an insect and the crustacean is mostly well i say it 's mostly technical but so is all of invertebrate taxonomy it 's interesting to me but the the bulk of the difference is they 're got gills so that they live in water and get their oxygen from the water where insects have tracheal paths in the in the abdomen their body little openings that let air in and they get their oxygen from air two pairs of antenna is another key difference if you 've got something from your garden you 're not sure if it 's an insect or a crustacean look at the numbers of antenna on that first segment coming off the head if there 's an eye that 's usually a dead giveaway where there it is two pairs of antenna it 's always a crustacean one pair of antenna it 's an insect no antenna it 's a spider and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they called laterally flattened so they 're squished side to side if you think of them as having an up and a down there 's another group that i 've put into a separate tray called the isopods they are also ventrally flattened off these also occur in our gardens in the form of slaters or butcher boys or oh that 's a crab sorry where are my isopods there 's one so slaters are isopods they are a crustacean in the group isopoda they also also eventually flatten so flatten from the top to the bottom they roll up when they feel threatened and this is in my favorite family of isopods there 's all different families in all of these different crustacean groups they 're incredibly diverse the sphyro mataday isopods i think are the most beautiful they 've got beautifully sculptured and textured carapace um body segment coverings quite often got lovely colors on them too can be quite fast these ones tend to be scavengers um you might remember there was a footballer got very badly bitten when they stood in the bay for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the best of times and standing in cold water um leaves me bewildered but for some reason that 's part of their training regime and they got really badly bitten they came out of the water bleeding and they hadn 't felt the bites because it was so cold a lot of the bites were being done by the scavenging species within the isopods and the anthropods they can be really vicious so anything that dies in the water tends to get eaten very quickly by these little tiny munchy crustaceans i love them but in this tray i 've also put some very pretty little crabs these are hymenocemented crabs or sergeants hat crabs i can 't pick them up with the forceps because i don 't want to damage them but when you look at these from the side they look like a police sergeant 's hat you know that sort of flattened cap and very very common in port phillips sediments there are about four species that we find in port phillip on a regular basis and a tremendous amount of protein just wandering around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sand flats and seagrass beds that 's my specialty right there uh in the center of picture right now we 've got a bit of a worm tube i studied worms under robin wilson at the museum of victoria became the focus of my honours project and a lot of my my subsequent work there 's no worm actually in that tube they 've moved on but huge amounts of protein and biomass and biodiversity kicking around in the soft sediments in worm form polychaete worms we have oligo keats in our gardens pollock gates are a bit more interesting they 've got a tremendous like the crustaceans tremendous range of body forms and heads and different feeding styles some of them are feeding by ingesting the sediment and getting their nutrients from the protein from the bacteria and the fungus that live on the sediment some of them are predators feeding on the amphipod crustaceans and the other worms living in the sediment there are some that filter feed on plankton with a beautiful crown of tentacles sticking out of a tube oh they 've all moved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they they partly because robin wilson was an inspiring mentor partly because they 're just an incredible range of animals really rock my socks so i i get enthusiastic about crustaceans i get passionate hey matt hello there hello yeah matt kate kate has also asked um are chitins the same kind of isopod as your favorite one given that you were speaking about them before i thought i 'd interrupt you oh chitons are a mollusk so chitins belong to a group within the mollusks called the polyplaque offer are the many shells so chitins are those eight armored plates you 'll sometimes find suctioned onto a rock in the intertidal or the the low subtitle so they look like a crustacean because of that eight plated shell they look like an arthropod but they 're part of the mollusks because unlike arthropods they don 't have the jointed limbs that gives the group the name they have the molluscum features which are a muscular foot that they suck down onto the rock with they have a mantle covering their organs um gills for oxygen and yeah those those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polyplacophora the chitins the snails that i 've already discussed the bivalves that i 'm about to come to in a moment and all of the octopus and squid and it 's this ridiculous disjunct in the diversity account their entire life suctioned onto perhaps a single boulder grinding away with a tongue with teeth called a radula getting there getting their nutrients from either the layer of micro algae living on that stuff on that substrate or the bacteria through to octopus and anyone 's that 's seen that delightful documentary my octopus teacher recently um such an engaging and clearly intelligent organism at completely the other end of that that spectrum of complexity of behavior and structure within the same group of organisms it 's it 's just ridiculous the diversity in some of these invertebrate groups and it 's really interesting to me that invertebrates are starting to catch attention and drive passion to the same extent that dolphins previously sort of held the exclusive ground all through my career in marine science people here you 're a marine biologist say oh you must love dolphins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not what drives my my interest now the invertebrates these these documentaries about my octopus teacher and the the passion that 's going into the spider crabs in port phillip at the moment um it 's really heartening that people are finding it in their in their emotional and mental space to care about invertebrates is new to me and i find it really really cool but there 's us beyond polychaete under the center of frame now spionids are one of those group of polychaetes that feeds almost exclusively on the sediment you can see its gut is completely full of the the fine sediment that i collected it from the the little frontie tentacle sort of looking structures coming off the head they have a groove down the center that will actually select for the smaller particles they don 't want to eat the big grains of sand because there 's not as much surface area per amount of volume you 're not getting the same amount of surface on which the back eating be good so there 's a groove along those tentacles that fits a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if you look to my diver mat camera one small small particles will fit oh sorry it 's all back to front small particles will fit inside the big particles will be knocked off the top and that way they get to select for the smaller particles they get more bang for each mouthful and you can see that the sediment is actually moved down through the gut so it 's about an hour and a half since i did my sampling it 's taken an hour and a half for the sediment to move from the mouth parts to where we can see it in the gut now so it 's probably got a four hour gut retention time to digest as much of the bacteria and fungus off of that sediment and get its nutrients before it 's pooped out the end of the pagitium and you can even see the muscular action going on in there that peristaltic motion they 're trying to get the maximum amount of chemical interaction between their gut enzymes and the sediment so it 's pumping it around it 's making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation and maximize the amount of nutrient that it gets for the gut retention time after about four hours it 's it 's sort of done as much as it can so it 's it 's not a long digestive process like a cow it 's pretty straightforward stuff get get the sediment in there digest as much nutrient off it as you can and get it out the back end so you 've got room for more moving on from mice be honored more snail shells there is a sea urchin test see urchins i mentioned earlier the um the echinoderm the spiny skinned animals the econoderms includes all the sea urchins all of the starfish all of the sea cucumbers sea urchins protect themselves with an exoskeleton of plates of calcium carbonate the same chemical that we use to make our internal skeleton of bone it goes into an external skeleton for them which they then cover in spines and they 're pretty well protected against anything that might try and fit them inside their mouth nothing wants to eat a pincushion with a bunch of spines facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about its protective layers it 's just bashed through it on that side and munched the inners out unlike mollusks where the exoskeleton has to grow at a single margin so they 've got a sort of limitation to their body complexity because they can only ever add to that outer margin echinoderms are able to grow their entire exoskeleton incrementally because it fits together like a jigsaw puzzle it 's really cool when you look even closer at a sea urchin test or exoskeleton it fits together like a beautiful jigsaw puzzle and each piece of that puzzle can add to its margin so they can grow that that exoskeleton in all directions at once where a snail or a bivalve mollusk can only add to the the most recently deposited margin crustaceans grow bigger by shedding their exoskeletons so their complexity of body can 't get away with that incremental growth along a single margin and they don 't have the the cellular complexity to do what the sea urchins are doing with their jigsaw puzzle growth it 's interesting uh steer more closely related to us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we grow our anus first we we start off as a blob of cells and we grow an anus we are second to grow the mouth we got the name deuterostome which means second to grow the mouth i think we should have been called proto-anus first to grow the anus but that sets us apart from all of the mollusks and the crustaceans and the worms because they are proto-stones they grow their mouth first so at some point in the history of the development of life on earth the echinoderms split off from the proto-stones and we were part of that split we are more closely related to a c star than we are to a squid or an octopus and i 'm fine with that but it 's just weird that our closest relative sort of has this limiting body structure they have radial symmetry where most animals split down the middle and have a left and right side echinoderms have multiple sides i 'll just turn my i 'll switch to this camera as the main because we 've got some fairly big stuff going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they don 't have a front and back which is hard to think about like what 's it like to live as an animal with no front and back part of the problem with that well part of the advantage of that is that they can lose body parts and regrow them they 've got radial symmetry they don 't have a head there 's sort of no critical single structure that you can stab at and kill them in fact if you cut a sea star into its separate arms each separate arm can grow a new sea star so there is redundancy in that and it 's a huge advantage in terms of survivability but because they don 't have a head because they don 't have a central processor for all of their sensory inputs they 've never gotten particularly complex all of the smart animals or all of the animals that we think of is smart which includes mammals birds octopuses have three organs and their mouth are located and the sensory organs help the mouth find the food and avoid danger the intelligence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radially symmetrical animal so they 're all just stimulus response so all the sea stars and sea urchins and other radially symmetrical animals like jellyfish never really got the smarts going but i 've switched over to the the larger view of the camera just to show perhaps the the single biggest find that a bird can come across in its foraging in the in the sand flats and seagrass beds the bivalve mollusks that 's where the money is bivalve molecules are just a big lump of protein with an exoskeleton that exoskeleton can be quite tough but if you 've got a strong enough bill or some some behavior that will allow you to get past that there 's a huge amount of protein available in there that you can feed on some birds are able to pry them open other birds i 've seen dropping them from a great height trying to crack them open on a rock smaller iterations or smaller species they can eat whole but if a bird can crack open a bivalve mollusk that 's that 's huge news for them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single animal huh so i 've talked almost non-stop for the better part of half an hour now i think it 's probably only wise to hand over for some questions has anyone been lining up for me matt i 'm sure we 'd have a ton of questions because i 've just been fascinated by that um thanks matt that that was fantastic thank you very much for having me yeah welcome and yeah we 've had lots of lots of love for you on the chat line too lots of people saying thank you so much that was fantastic wow lots of lots of exclamations um and kate has just also added that the yellow sea is crucial to shaw birds as a stopover and it has been developed greatly but areas have also recently been world heritage listed which is really fantastic um and there 's some more stuff there on the chat so if you want to check that out check that out and if there 's nothing else from andrew or jackie i will move on and next we look we thought that andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm going to hand over to my partner in the conservation ranger space andrew webster to help us find some of our migratory waiters in hobson 's bay now also if you have been sending any private chats to andrew to him to answer please start sending um myself or jackie um you can send them to everyone if you want but if you have any sort of private questions or technical questions please um now direct the chat to my jackie as andrew won 't be able to answer them over to you andrew thanks everyone i hope you got me there thanks suzette hi everyone um hope you 've enjoyed the day so far it 's certainly not going to be a case of saving the best till last but um i did think in organizing the order of speakers today that would be sort of telling you all about the birds and now matt 's showing you all the cool stuff along our shoreline that they 're eating that is probably best to do that first and then i 'll try and answer that question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of you in tuning in from places other than hobsons bay welcome please visit us sometime it 's a great place and i still think i 'll have enough nice pictures to show you to keep you interested i 'm just going to start off today by just doing a short acknowledgment of country to that end i 'd like to acknowledge the peoples of the cooler nation they being the traditional owners of the lovely shoreline and coastal areas which the birds are coming to visit here and we also get great pleasure from ourselves of course and we recognise the first peoples relationship to this land and offer our respects to their elders past present and emerging now in today 's presentation i 'm just going to start with showing some lovely images taken by another andrew it 's a great name one of our local bird observers the photos you are about to see have all been seen or taken within the last 12 months mostly in the last month or so there will certainly be a few repeat images of birds that lindle and kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof that they are here and they are here now um without repeating what we 've already heard today i 'll probably just mention a quirky fact or two about each bird particularly for those who might not have been here this morning then i 'll show you some maps of you know areas around hobson 's bay here where we can see the birds and zoom in for a little closer look and then i 'm going to finish up with a few tips on on how to spot the birds just before i i bring up my slides i thought i 'd just briefly mention the bird the photo above my head here um this is a little redneck stint it 's a beautiful photograph taken a few years ago now by a friend of mine peter you 'll notice the orange tag on its leg i just sort of thought that was probably worth mentioning a group known as the australasian wader studies group formed about 30 years ago and they started banding the birds to help study you know where they go where they 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was banded not only in australia but actually in victoria for those geelong fans out there playing tonight the bird has a blue tag and a white tag on it well that means it was tagging taiwan for example so that 's what the tags mean anyway on with some pictures i 'll um i 'll share my screen here hopefully anyway that 's the idea just bear with me for a sec while i get that up okay hopefully we 've got this here we all we got me there cezad yep you 're all good okey-dokey now oh there 's my heading page we don 't really need to see too much of that do we um our local visitors okay now just to flick through a few photos first um about hard god we got mentioned earlier i won 't repeat too much but um the world record holder for the long longest non-stop flight about 11 000 kilometers in a round to the eight or nine days so that 's just down at the um we 'll call it way to beach but sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said before what you 're seeing some lovely images from andrew um these birds here have been here over winter which is a little bit unusual certainly here at the moment onto a wimble a little bit more unusual for us again we 've had one here over winter here at the moment um again down on our sort of altona slash williamstown for sure you can see the long curved beak especially designed to try and get some of those little mollusks and things that matt was talking about earlier and again if you missed lindell 's talk earlier the birds have all got different shaped beaks different size beaks and that 's basically so they 're all they don 't want to compete for the same type of food what they 're doing is they 're all got little points of difference so that they don 't all eat the same thing some might eat the ones at the top some eat halfway down some make the really deep ones down so they don 't compete it 's quite smart how they do that our redneck stint um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flocks you 'll see a flock in the picture there on the on the left there and i 'll talk a little bit more about them further along but the photo on the right i thought was really quite interesting again you those of you around would have seen um lindel 's images earlier of the the red color it 's called a redneck stint it 's got that red neck you can see it there very unusual for us it 's normally saved up for when it 's breeding over in the um in the arctic areas this bird did come over fairly early in our season i 'm not sure whether if we see the same bird today i 'm sure we will have lost it 's red by now so yeah we 're pretty lucky andrew is pretty lucky to get a photo of that for us to show today ruddy turnstone um called that from it 's sort of like ruddy name the colorations on it the turnstone is actually interesting it feeds by flipping over or turning over rocks shelves and seaweed um again if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little patch of seaweed like you 're seeing on the on the left there turn it over or pick it up and you 'll find little critters all pop out all over the place well that 's what the ruddy 's there trying to find out a common green shank not particularly common but usually seen in pairs or individually very rarely seen in groups being seen down at the ford at the altona coastal park this week i 'll get onto that a bit further on now i 'm not good at making sounds at the best of time but they have this cool like a choo choo choo i hope that came across okay but it 's quite distinctive when you hear when the bird flies into land or takes off you can usually tell they 're around by by listening for that our sharp tail sandpiper probably the one you 're most likely to see around our shoreline not necessarily because you 'll see flocks of hundreds or thousands but just it tends to pop up in most of our areas most of the areas i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see one of those a lot like typical of the the migratory shorebirds they 're pretty they 're carnivores they pretty well eat anything that moves um to help with your eye identification you can see the close-up pictures on the the center and the right they have this distinct sort of cap on their head which can help you to um spot the difference between the sharp tail sandpipers onto our great knot australia actually holds the largest population of these outside of the arctic area northern hemisphere and we actually don 't see many of them at all down here in hobson 's bay again this photo was all these photos were taken last week so that one is here it 's not particularly common but um is around and it 's great to see see at least a couple visiting us anyway latham 's snipe for those with good memories we 'll have seen lindell 's talk earlier and she said that shorebirds are normally seen on the shore you may have noticed that this one actually wasn 't on the shore this one was a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by andrew was seen at the williamstown wetlands down at the jawbone floor and fauna reserve last year and it was tucked away in amongst the reeds quite hard to spot um but yeah so they 're not all on the actual shore itself onto our curlew sandpiper federally critically endangered someone is an australian wine scale critically endangered we 're a little bit lucky down here in hobson 's bay spain that they 're not critically endangered for us in hobson 's bar for victoria they are quite commonly commonly spotted spotted so you know we 're a little bit luckier down here in that um we get our fair share of fair share of those although we could always get more i suppose we 've always loved more that 's it for my photos we 'll just go on to our municipality and um i 'm sure suzette will tell me if you can 't see my mouse but i 'm assuming you can see my mouse i 'm up here at spotswood at the top sort of top right hand corner there so hobson 's bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we follow the freeway down a little bit of brooklyn outside the freeway we come down our freeway down through laverne down to point cook road and pretty well hobson 's bay encompasses everywhere between there and the coast today we 're going to start over here at newport on the right hand side there we 'll come in a little bit closer to that one there so here we are we 're going to start off at sandy point and the spit we find them by either driving down to the strand in newport or if you 're on the bay west bike trail shared trail which pretty well goes through all of the sites i 'm going to show you today you 'll find this place there 's two little sort of isthmus or bits of land sticking out there don 't see great quantities of birds there but you normally always find the odd one or two out there and it 's a lovely little walk you can see from the interpretation sign there that not only are we highlighting in this case here we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got our red capped plava oyster catches some of the other resident birds that you 're likely to see in the area over there at sandy point in the spit we 're going to move around the coast a little bit here we are we 've come around to point jelly brand i 'm assuming you 're gathering that we 've got the little birdie with the um red circle around it 's what i 'm using today to show where we are so around at point jolly brand battery road for a short while there was called steve brax promenade named after um steve brax like a willie resident when he was premier a few years back but again it 's on that bay west bike trail easy to get to there 's a car park at either end of battery road there so if you if you are by car you park at one end or the other and wander along the path until you get to like the rocky areas the picture on the right now um we heard sandra mention it earlier um and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a flock of approximately 2 000 rednecks stints maybe more bit hard to count when you 've got that many flying around down there as we speak i believe they were saying i 've certainly seen during the week and i believe they were seen this morning so yeah awesome that they 're they 're down here and in great numbers so obviously good spot if you 're looking to see a large number at the moment we 'll track around air force or a little bit further to the the jawbone reserve slash rifle range reserve depending on which side of the fence you 're you 're looking at really there 's a few interesting spots along here firstly you 've got the main wall jawbone boardwalk the boardwalk that heads out and gives you a look at the jawbone marine point if you like not so much the marine sanctuary because you can 't get onto the coastline there but looking at my image there on the left hand side you 've got the bay so you 'll have your waders out there and again not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like our spoonbills egrets those types of birds and on the right hand side just out of shot there 's little lagoons in there as well which are lovely spots for bird watching as well so i certainly can highly recommend you heading out that way if you haven 't haven 't always haven 't done so yet moving along to the picture on the right there 's the williamstown wetlands or the lakes within the rifle range reserve there um a great opportunity for bird spotting again of all sorts not the major spot for our migratory waders but certainly a great spot to see the birds and i 'll just mention briefly the the sign we 've got their lovely interpretation sign we 've got approximately 52 odd of signs around our our areas this one here was designed by local artist rob mancini absolutely awesome it 's a bit hard to see all the detail on the on the screen here but even bunnies like me can help id you 'll find the id birds with with images like this going around we 'll move along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chalice wetlands i 'll zoom in here we 've got an aerial shot here to try and sort of put it into sort of perspective for us we 've got the mouth of corey creek here we 've got maddox road this road that runs up here little car park down the bottom we 've got corey creek road that 's running along where my mouse is running along this way you 'll be able to see the city up the background there west gate bridge in the foreground of the williamstown wetlands or the lakes where we just were a moment ago so down by the the bird hide down there there 's also a little path that goes around here as well on the right hand side here is the picture of our of our bird hide another one of our interpretation signs there you can see the tides fairly well out in in the picture here an absolutely awesome spot to go and check out the bird life and would be great on a day like today we should be out there not in here shouldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're just going around the corner little bit further here we are at the ford the picture on the left so we 're on corroid creek here it 's called the ford because when uh when we get rain or maybe in times of high tide the road that we 're currently that i 'm on there race course road gets flooded and water flows over there if you look closely you 'll see looks like we 've got an egret up there we 've got a couple of teals of some sort in the image as well but a very accessible spot there 's a car park just out of frame it 's also on that bike trail which you can see there as well if you follow the path a little bit further you 'll come down to where the image on the on the right is there 's a few other interpretation signs there this sign here is the brainchild of um hayden goodall from sardine designs another one of our our local designers and we 've got a picture of a you see a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut out of a red cap plumber on the top of one post here and a steel cut out of a great egret there now they 're actually made for life size so you can get a bit of a comparison of what size birds you 're actually looking for and this one when we say is a red cap plumber we 've also got a sign around it 's got our sharp tail sand pipe on it as well which is a similar size and also a redneck stint as well so they 're sort of aimed to give you a bit of a perspective of the actual size of the birds we 're looking for there 's obviously a bit of information on there as well this one 's interesting and you can see the bar across the top here underneath the great egret that was designed so that we could actually hopefully get a great egret perch on the bar there and you can actually see a real one next to a metal one we thought that would be pretty cool haven 't seen an egret on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit on there one thing we didn 't think about was that birds like sitting on there where my arrow is and then they like going to the toilet and you can see what 's underneath there and so i 'm with our 52 signs around the place luckily they don 't all have these perches on top because it requires a little bit of cleaning this sign here move along a little bit we sort of skip through most of the altona foreshore here it 's not to say there is nothing there there 's a couple of rocky outcrop areas where fantastic for spotting things like the cormorants your little pies and your little blacks if you go along a little bit further just past the swimming beach when the tide 's out you can often see things like our pied oyster catchers silly oyster catchers blackwing stilts our more um our residential birds you come down a little bit further and you get down to leviton creek or doug doug grant reserve and the mouth of lebanon creek we 'll just zoom in a little bit here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the interpretation little seating a little interpretation board is a roundabout where my cursor is here on the aerial there giving you a great view over these wetlands here and looking towards cheatham wetlands which is extremely significant as that 's known as what we call a ramsar site which without getting too technical is a wetland of international significance so obviously not too many of them around and of course the birds don 't realize that this area here is not actually a ramsar site or internationally significant so they come over and visit us over here in great numbers when all these little sand bars around here and the coming and going of the tide provide great spots for our for our waiters to pop in and have a meal and although everyone talks about the weary bee treatment plant as being number one in victoria which i 'm not disputing that for a minute um we like to think that an area like here is starting to come pretty close if you 're on the on the bay west bike trail walking or bike riding you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here there 's a little bridge over here you can come down to another parkland danny known as tragonian park you can also walk down this side a bit here you can spend plenty of hours down there exploring the area we 'll move around to tragonina swamp um we 're trying to give it the name of um more like trigona wetlands these days it sounds a little bit nicer i can zoom in a little bit closer on this one here it 's a little bit unheld it actually because it doesn 't really have an obvious access point it 's not on that bay west bike trail so it doesn 't get frequented by a lot of passing traffic but for those few locals who know about it it 's just one of those really great great quiet spots where you can basically be miles away from anywhere you just got to make sure you don 't look too far in the distance and see the industry miles away but um i hope i haven 't let the cat have out of the bag there but um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot to get away from it all and um aside from birds frogs all those sorts of things it 's a great spot to actually um to visit there now onto some tips i actually started with the idea of calling this section in the presentation my top 10 tips but then after talking to a few people and doing some googling uh we came up well there was a million top 10 tips out there so it 's obviously a very subjective area so what i 've done is i 've really just crammed a few things into a couple of slides that from my perspective are important so if there 's someone else out there who has got other great ideas by all means stick him up on the chat but here we are we 'll just start with the win and the wear i hope i 've helped you with the wear the wind um those obviously i 've been here for the long haul today probably pretty familiar with that basically spring and summer certainly from about now through to february we 've also got on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early some of them have come over earlier and as we 've also heard and i 've also said that some of them stayed here over the winter but certainly we 're probably getting into study to get into peak season now early morning early evening everyone probably knows the old saying early bird catches the worm generally probably the case um early evening can be a little bit of a catch we got a lot of quite strong sea breezes coming in the afternoon over here in altona and williamstown and the birds tend to um take cover in some of the more protected areas in those times of day and if they 're taking cover in the more protected area it generally means it 's a bit harder for us to see them as well probably the most important point i 've got up there is the the run out tide what we mean by that is that we certainly don 't want to full tide obviously if the water 's knee deep then these little birds that are only 10 centimeters high aren 't going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to wade around him so that it 's deep enough to stop the animals from hiding but not deep enough so that the birds can 't find them so what i mean by the run out tide is to use an example if we if we say high tide at six o 'clock oh no actually let 's say that was high tide at 12 o 'clock today as in midday today and low tide at six o 'clock tonight then you probably wouldn 't be seeing too many now at one o 'clock it 's probably still too high but you probably find if you went out around you know mid afternoon when the tide is low enough for the birds to be able to wade around and find what they 're looking for but at the same time the tide is still going out which means it 's revealing new spots which means new little creatures are basically coming to the surface that have no time to to hurry away so one thing i can recommend is that yeah you look up the tides before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app on my phone which i find really useful to work out when the best time to go and have a look it doesn 't mean to say that it 's no good at low tide or it 's low no good when the tide 's coming in but um yeah the main thing to avoid is high tide okay clothing to protect you from the elements firstly there i am um obviously some people are more susceptible to sunburn and things like that obviously you 're going to wear warmer clothes if it 's cold a couple of things i 'll point out here is the fairly tough pants and the fairly tough boots i 'm not going to say for a minute that 's mandatory but at this time of year we 've got our friendly tiger snakes our friendly tiger snakes love to visit where the birds go at the moment and one of the things you notice with bird watchers is that they 're not looking at the ground too often you know they 're looking up at the sky or they 've got the binoculars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don 't want to get up too close and personal to a tiger snake with your thongs and shorts on so i 'm not saying you 've got to wear those boots but we 've got to be pretty careful of where we 're walking particularly this time of year you 'll also notice that i 've got the binoculars the camera got the hat on now obviously the hats to keep the sun off off my head but it also actually helps to keep the glare away too you know if you 're taking photos things like that the hat can certainly help you um look that way make it the view a bit clearer i 've got the drink bottle there um you don 't see too many birds from the front seat of your into your car you 've normally got to go for a bit of a wander look i mean most people probably got a backpack with a drink bottle in it and a bit of food but that would have made for a fairly boring picture i thought so i 've got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i 've got a little pocket-sized identification book sticking in my pocket there so that 's me i 've got on the screen there hi viewers clothing no no now i 'm not sure if my old mate dave 's listening in today but a few years ago i organized a bird watching tour and i 've rocked up in my council standard issue the ears fluoro lime green and i still haven 't heard the end of that um what i didn 't really think about at the time is that the serious birds like to wear their camouflage gear so they can sneak up close and take a photograph well there was andrew and his high views gear scaring them all away before they could get anywhere near them so don 't do what i did um oh there you go it 's amazing we can get off powerpoint these days just a couple of images there socialize come to events like today check out facebook instagram there 's a there 's a group called um wildlife of hobsons bay i 'm always seeing images of birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when you 're out and about chat to people spread the word um it 's usually one of the best ways of getting to know what 's actually out there is to actually listen to others on to my last slide we 've got a few great digital resources one 's called ebird australia the other one of course birdlife australia they 've got a function there called bird data if you go on to either of those applications there you can look up hot spots you can you could look up for example rifle range reserve or jawbone reserve see what 's been seen lately you could look up a redneck stint to see where it 's been seen so it 's a really good place to start if you 're wondering what 's actually around of course we highly recommend that um any things you find you actually input it yourself because of course they 're only as good as the data they 're receiving from people so but a great place to start uh most of us have probably got a phone in our pocket when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app on there i 've got the pizzeria night app there cost me about 60 odd dollars [Music] i love it i think it 's fantastic to me well worth the investment there 's some free apps around at the moment the the cornell merlin lab app i don 't know a lot about it i just heard really good things about it though if anyone 's out there listening in as has it and has any feedback they 'd like to put on the chat i 'm sure that would be helpful but that 's another app that i that is out there then you 've got the old school bird guide book nothing beats that when you 're sitting down at night um there 's always some great illustrations and drawings and those sorts of books over on the right there i 've got to give our book a bit of a plug we 've got a little birds of hobsons bay coastline booklet there is an online version it doesn 't help you too much usually when you 're out in the field you 're probably better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there our email address if you don 't already have it normally i 'd say i 'll drop one round to you a bit hard at the moment but we 'll stick one in the post for you if you 'd like one of those and that suzette is that,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Australia",1498,[Music] you good morning everyone I 'm Andrew I 'm one of the conservation Rangers it Hobson 's Bay City Council and this morning we 're down at the enviro Center the Altona library looking at one of our taxidermy animals we have down there now we probably all know if this is a penguin what sort of penguin is it it 's a little penguin that 's the one we have over here now you may be a bit surprised to hear that we do actually occasionally get penguins in Hobson 's Bay this won 't that 'll one here was actually found in the Williamstown foreshore a few years ago now but we do occasionally see them around our tone away as well now we believe this one came over from the colony it 's and killed I think it would appear some of you may have been over there and somehow it found its way over here now what I want to talk to you today about was some of the ways the Penguins actually adapted to living into their local environment I think we all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold climates so here how do they do that I firstly start by just beginning with that the thing we often forget about is that the penguin is actually a bird penguins and emus are two very unusual birds in that they don 't fly we always think of birds as flying but when you look at this penguin if you look at the wings these things here they 're actually the Penguins flippers so they 're their wings have turned into flippers so although they 're too small to fly they 're very well designed to be able to swim really fast in the water which is what it needs to do now a few of the other features about this one penguin here is let 's have a look down its feet down here the feet are webbed we all know Ducks have webbed feet ducks have their webbed feet again so they can swim around and again so what this penguin does is it has the web fate to help but swim and you 'll actually find if you see movies of the Penguins alive swimming they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal and with the flippers and with the web fate pedals along really really fast I 'm not sure if you actually tried putting flippers on your feet at the local swimming pool or something like that you can swim a lot faster having like these flippers or web feet on the other thing about the feet which you may be able to notice is the long toes or claws on the end see that 's so that the penguin it can actually grip on on either the rocks or the ice now we often see penguins in icy areas and we wonder why don 't they slip well that 's because they 've got these little claws that can dig into the ice now little penguins they 're not found down in the ice but they come along and like where this one would have come from some killed appear big rock walls over there where they climb over so they use these claws to help them grip on to that under the rocks and help climb around or move around on land now a couple of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beak up the top up here or the bill it 's very strong and it 's very tough and it 's been specially designed to actually help it get its food now what 's its food I think we probably all know they eat fish they had other things like squid and also things like sea jellies as well so the the bill here has been designed to actually help eat those things they will come and have a look at the eyes most of us are probably been swimming down at the beach and you get salt water in your eyes it really stings doesn 't it we don 't like that so why don 't the Penguins get salt water in their eyes all the time they 're always out in the water aren 't they they 've got these special things called salt glands above their eyes and although you can 't see them on the camera here what they do is they like filter or catch all the salt in the water and then let the clean water with no salt in it run over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do that the other thing we 'll talk about is the fur of the penguin again I think we all know penguins are in and out of the water all the time leaving cold climate how do they do that or to start with they 've got like a waterproof fur on their back here it 's a bit like you and I wearing a raincoat so when they go on the water the actual water itself doesn 't get through that outer coating of fur now we may also you 've often probably seen documentaries things on TV where you see the chicks the baby penguins standing around on the ice though it 's actually usually for a couple of months on some breeds of penguins and you wonder why don 't they just go and swim in the water get some food themselves why they don 't do it is because it takes them about two months around about to actually develop the waterproof fur without the waterproof fur or coating they 've got they 'll just freeze if they go swimming so this little one he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also got a very soft downy feathery type feathers underneath as well a bit like me wearing this jacket so nice wooly jacket so really this penguins a bit like me going outside with this nice wooly jacket on and a raincoat on which is keeping me dry and warm now while we 're also looking at the fur here let 's look at the color for a moment you can see at the top there it 's sort of like a dark blue a gray color now if the Penguins swimming along in the water and one of its predators from the air may be around let 's think of a sea eagle there 's a common one the CEO was up there flying around and looks down into the water the waters always a dark blue a color same color as the penguin so what the Penguins doing is the penguin is camouflaging itself it 's making itself very hard to be seen by the air because it looks just like the water does now how about its predators in the water let 's think of seals I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on penguins if a seals swimming underneath the penguin looking for something to eat and looking up at the sky the sky is always light it 's always quite white when you 're in the water looking towards the Scots they might see the white of the penguin and not actually realise it 's a penguin so again the penguin is using camouflage to keep away from those predators like seals in the water now the final thing I 'll finish up on is what can we do to help penguins I often get asked that question when we think of their threats or their main predators usually humans unfortunately one of the main problems let 's think of fishing they might get caught up in fishing nets we hear of oil spills that might kill everything in the water and unfortunately there 's a litter of rubbish that finds its way out in the Port Phillip Bay here and out into the oceans that the Penguins sometimes think is food and eat it and we go yuck imagine eating rubbish so if we can avoid letting our litter go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that then we 'd certainly going to help the Penguins survive on land a couple of their major predators are foxes and cats introduced animals that love preying on our native birds so if we can keep our cats indoors and try and put measures in place or do things that keep foxes and cats away then we 're also going to increase the chances of this penguin surviving that 's it from me today thanks very much for listening I hope you enjoyed it and we 'll see you at near Park sometime [Music] [Music] you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Translation),rNE1TvpFL7k,20211027,729.12,"115 Civic Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",2028,[Music] deciding to breastfeed is a wonderful thing for you and your baby 's current and future health but it can be challenging hey hello how are you today there is a lot of conflicting information out there and we are here to simplify things for you and your family at hobson 's bay maternal and child health service we are here to support you on this challenging and rewarding journey the pregnancy and the birth were easy i think the breastfeeding part was the biggest challenge that i faced personally my birth i had a third degree tear so breastfeeding her in the first couple of weeks was difficult just in the sense that it was hard to find a position to be comfortable in my supply never really established very well and i had a very hungry boy as well so he would fade you know every sort of two hours well i had a c-section to begin with so the milk did not flow as quickly as it usually would i suppose so that was the first challenge i had and then the obvious latching issues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i was just so so happy that i got an appointment with jane because she ended up being able to help me with how to actually get sunny to latch on properly and she was able to you know pretty much um feed pretty much straight after that now we could perhaps try something different he 'll go on okay yeah there you go so show me how you were doing it before and then we 'll go through another position newborn baby speed every two to three hours what i didn 't realize was that that counted from the start of a feed so that was a huge shock for me i just fed him every single time he um wanted to feed i just knew how important it was you know if he wanted to cluster feed which i think he did on the third night pretty much constant feeding um i just kept doing it even though it was still incredibly painful when she was cluster feeding it could be every half an hour to an hour during the rest of the day it could be anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching other mothers have no problems and saying oh you know oh i just have to you know feed every two hours because i 've just got so much milk and and you 're sitting there and thinking why don 't i being a same-sex couple um you know the only way of becoming pregnant was to to go down the ivf road um and within that there 's the roller coaster rides of ups and downs and um you think all right well we 're going to do this at this point in time well sometimes that point in time can 't happen for a myriad of reasons you kind of learn you can 't control this you 're creating a life and it 's a human life and every single human is different so you can 't control any of that so for us we learnt that really really early on we 're going to remove any pressure from the back of its head and we 're just going to move that hand this hand normally is here so we 're going to use the other hand same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from okay sometimes do you find this bottom arm gets in the way and pushes so sometimes it can be a little bit awkward to do but it just gives you a bit more time if you roll that arm underneath okay and then you just lean back with baby bull 's-eye to your nipple okay so you 're just going to watch you don 't have to get him on your job is to provide the breast his job is to decide whether he wants to have a feed i 'd say that it started to feel more second nature at around sort of the three or four month mark uh in the beginning when my milk came in i felt quite full um i had maybe a little bit of over supply but not to the point of being engorged just a lot for a little baby how does that feel yeah good it tends the worst pain and zeros no pain yeah i mean that 's a very mild pain okay compared to what 's just a one or a two i 'd say so yeah very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit so you can just kind of shift them just millimeters okay just to see whether just a little movement will make any difference to where that nipple is in their mouth just see if that reduces this arm just using that hair yes so it 's lovely that you 've got him right on his side because that enables his head to be in a straight line and him to go straight onto your breast right if babies are like this and have to turn their head it 's putting a lot of strain on their neck muscles and shortening their tongue so it 's harder for them to put a good amount okay they 've also got little receptors in their tummy so when the tummy is next to your tummy they feel secure and so they 're more likely to feed more efficiently that 's nice i honestly don 't know how anyone does it without a supportive partner i really don 't because they have a massive massive role to play and you know for the first six months i didn 't clean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than look after sunny your partner really has to kind of come to the you know to the game ready to play and and do all those things that you really don 't have time to do and you know it changes over time but certainly in those early um first few months you really can 't do much more than just look after your baby i was really lucky that my partner is very supportive and he would do things like change the nappy overnight so that i didn 't have to get up out of bed if i was really tired my role was pretty much to support her as best i can to make you feel as comfortable as i can just make sure she 's hydrated so there 's lots of breast milk for a baby i find that i have to drink about three liters of water a day to keep hydrated and to keep you know producing a lot of water definitely so you need to keep up with your fluids and the moment you will have the fluids i remember you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where exactly it is flowing so definitely that and highly nutritious diet trying to take care of myself just in sort of eating well trying to rest as much as you can exercise moderately for my own mental health just to feel good as a person so that you have the energy to keep going you have to take over a lot a big responsibility so in my case so my wife could focus on breastfeeding and making sure she 's as well rested as she can be so have you noticed any signs of when he 's had enough uh he usually just pulls straight away gets he usually feeds until he 's quite sleepy and then he just pulls off do you ever see the action slowing right down so he does one two three stop yeah slows down yeah yeah when is that enough so some mums have been confused by that because they think if they 're still doing some sucks they 're feeding but when they 're doing one two three stop one two three stop they 're often just comfort sucking right if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're asleep or not you can just roll them baby back and forth and just see and if they 're not finished they 'll go hang on one don 't go away and they 'll grab back on again and have another good feed yeah because he often it 's like he loses interest or he forgets that he 's fading yeah and he 'll just pause for 10 seconds and then he 'll be like oh wait i know where i am i keep going bit more yeah like that 's that 's him for usually he just kind of falls off yeah like that it 's incredibly important to have a supportive partner and they can help you in the feeding process you know having just having them there to burp and change the nappy you know in in between your feeding is just really nice and you you feel like they 're part of it too i think that 's that probably helps especially if it 's difficult the the self-care that i have had has been allowing sam the time in the morning to care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a walk or you know feed her breakfast now that she 's on solids so how did you feel in that position changing from holding the back of his head to this position she 's going to take some practice i think so i 'm so used to the other way if you make yourself a bit of a throne on the couch and lean yourself back and get really comfortable you probably find it 's much easier because he 'll naturally be lying on you okay what i think is important is to listen to experts rather than just seeking random advice from internet from mr google dr google and things so if you 're planning to breastfeed talk to other mums that have breastfed do a breastfeeding class know what you want before your baby is born because that helps you to keep going if i can give anyone some advice it 's if like follow your intuition on something if you don 't think you 're going to get the right outcome or support going down one avenue then try another one because there are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i come back and see you just to um kind of check in and you can see how i 'm going or certainly if you get any pain again or you you 've got any questions that 's what we 're here for that 's why i give you my email address today so that you can contact me if necessary and another colleague and also so there are two two of us that put aside half a day a week to assist mums with breastfeeding yeah no worries that 's great thank you i think that the thing that made it easiest for me to keep breastfeeding was the support that i had around me um the fact that my own mother breastfed three children for somewhere between 14 and 17 months and was encouraging of it the fact that my partner has been really supportive and encouraging of it so in the mother 's group i can say that yes it was hard to talk to people about it but otherwise professionally no the maternal health nurse was very approachable i could actually pick up the phone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fantastic relationship with her if you have any questions or concerns about feeding your baby please get in touch with us as soon as possible [Music] you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

newest australians into our community and to witness the passing of the baton from our outgoing citizen of the year to our 2022 citizen and young citizen of the year for many of the individuals we are

tales to tell about how they got to be here all of you i 'm sure will play an unique role in the australians history uh going sorry australia 's story going forward on the subject of stories i have the great honour of introducing our australia day ambassador a woman with a very important story to tell in 2011 angela barker was named australia 's young australian of the year in recognition of her anti-domestic violence advocacy and education work after receiving significant injuries from a violent attack by her ex-boyfriend her continuing community work saw her awarded with the medal of the order of australia in 2019 and educates the public on anti-violence holds talks for students women men police politicians australia-wide in 2004 and story loves me loves me not featured in the australian government 's violence against women australia australia says no campaign to educate young people about domestic violence and respectful relationships this dvd is still in use throughout australia and also campaigns to stop young people ending up in nursing homes as this is where she has she was for two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is advocated for the national disability insurance scheme so that people with an acquired brain injury can have equal opportunity to regain an active and productive life and has a special relationship with it with hops and spay having featured in our 16 days of activism in 2009 2017 sorry and bravely shared a story and her image as part of an educational art installation in our city it 's such a great honor to have her virtually back in hopson

past and present thank you for inviting me to hobson bay for your australia day celebrations i feel very honoured to be your ambassador for this special occasion and for organizing this online celebration during what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country 's history i would like to now take some time to think of all the families and business that have suffered or been affected by covet 19 along with all the natural disasters we must remember all who have lost loved ones from australia and some from overseas and to their families who are grieving thank you to those wonderful people who work in our health system services and volunteers that are helping in some way with covered 19 and the natural disasters that are becoming more frequent and fierce it makes us sometime question how much more can we deal with it is now you see how amazing ordinary australians are i am one of many ambassadors in victoria adding our voices to the celebration of australia i am proud to be a part of this encouraging national program australia day ambassadors over the coming days will be participating in celebrations right across this land in every state and territory we must thank the national australian day council for making this possible let us all welcome to our australian family those here today who are new to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any hobbs and base citizens who may have been honored today being acknowledged and recognized by your community for your contribution in making your community in australia the amazing place it is my journey began back in 2002 at the age of 16 when i was brutally assaulted after refusing to return to a violent relationship i was left with a severe acquired axonal brain injury the doctors told my family that i would remain in a vegetative state for the rest of my life and that i should be put in a nursing home my parents wouldn 't accept this even though i did spend two and a quarter years in a nursing home to enable me to receive rehabilitation i was able to move home to country victoria three years after my injury it has been a long hard journey but i am getting there it took me five months to get my tongue past my lips nine months to move my thumb and five years to talk and for the past eight years i have been employed at the national australia bank in 2011 i had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year and i am now very proud to have been an australia day ambassador for the past 10 years in 2019 i was honoured on australia day with an order of australia medal i have received these great honors for the work i have done around young people living in aged care and the need for more appropriate accommodation and the national disability insurance scheme that now gives many people with a disability the right to receive the appropriate care respect and rehabilitation which we as people all deserve to move forward so we can take our rightful place back in the community the thing i am most passionate about is educating young people about respectful relationships after my brutal assault the government produced a dvd about my story as part of the australia cessna to violence against women campaign in 2004 which was sent to every secondary school in australia i have now spoken to around 45 000 students about respectful relationships throughout australia over the last 17 years i know i am making a difference and my dream is to see an end to relationship violence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can all contribute to this by treating each other with respect and not committing or remaining silent about violence in any form over the years since my injury i have needed to draw on those substantial australian qualities of determination courage honesty and perhaps more than anything else that amazing ozzy humor that we all share the ability to laugh instead of cry for me this has helped me get through 20 years of rehabilitation and i am sure many of you have used humor to deal with your own problems especially over the last two years thankfully yes i am still improving the other year i went skydiving it has been on my bucket list since i was 12 it was amazing in march 2019 i went ab ceiling to raise funds for police citizens youth club pcyc as you can hear i like to put myself out there never underestimate that australian spirit and the strength that you all have within you our nation 's story begins with the history of our aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples there is no better time to reflect on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some this day is a day of survival or morning we need to respect others views on this day today is a day we all should remind ourselves whether we were born here or those who have chosen to make australia your home why we love to live in australia australia is lucky enough to have a vibe in the air you can feel it all around us we can be happy and be who you want to be whoever that might be and there is an opportunity to have a strong support network we are able to believe whatever we want and the offer of education is there for all throughout australia even though this fight has been very tested over the past two years women in this country in theory have as many rights as men and although we need to improve further in the treatment of our women we have to acknowledge just how well we actually stand there is no shame for this country to say that we have to improve on some things as a young australian i appreciate that because of our freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows us to express who we are what we 're about and our individuality without fear and too much prejudice i would like us to also take time to acknowledge and remember our defence forces and peace corps of the past and present which have fought so that we have been and are able to keep our freedoms today we celebrate the fact that australia has heart and victoria has soul not only am i reminded today that i lived in the most amazing country but also the most exciting elaborate fulfilling creative diverse city that is melbourne the culture the coffee the food the beaches the art that fills the streets we cannot help but acknowledge how lucky we are although i now live in melbourne i was not always a city girl i was born and grew up in northeast victoria living in the country can have its challenges yet the rewards can far outweigh those hardships in life we owe so much to the people from the country for all the work they do to put food on our table country people are the true backbone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to many people for most it 's a day to do things we really enjoy from kicking around a ball going to the beach to chucking a snake on the barbie while catching up with family and friends on australia day we celebrate the community spirit we celebrate those who have been honored in the announcements of the order of australia awards and the australian of the year awards many of those honored will be volunteers from all cultures and walks of life working towards making a better and safer australia for us all volunteers are the glue that holds our society together someone is always ready to put their hand up to help we are seeing this in huge proportions this year it 's a bit easy to take all volunteers for granted until we need them and they are not there i hope you all take pride in wherever you live in this great country australia even with coveted 19 fighter and floods we are still a very lucky and inspirational country if you feel that someone here or someone you know is amazing for what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for next year 's australian of the year awards so they receive the acknowledgement they deserve one of my favorite sayings is believe in yourself and anything is possible and in our country this is very

Australia",1684,[Music] hi i 'm ranger suzette today we 're going to be looking for reptiles the kinds of reptiles we 're likely to find here in hobson 's bay are snakes and lizards you might also find some turtles in hobson 's bay but of course we 're not going to find any turtles here because you need water to find turtles also we 're not likely to see any snakes today snakes are actually quite cryptic animals which means they like to stay hidden especially from people they don 't really like people or dogs so if you are here with your dog or you 're here with yourself or a lot of people you 're unlikely to see any snakes now what should you do if you do see a snake let 's just pretend that this is a real snake if you are walking through the bush or anywhere and you happen to see a snake on the ground or maybe going across the track what you should do never approach the snake you should always back away slowly from the snake remember to look behind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything and keep backing away but watch where the snake is so you can tell if the snake is coming towards you or going away from you if we did see a snake in hobson 's bay it will almost certainly be a tiger snake tiger snakes are named this because they often have stripes like a tiger along their back but not always most reptiles can look very different all these snakes are tiger snakes but some look black some look brown and some don 't even have stripes other snakes that occur in hobson 's bay are the white lipped snake and the little whip snake these snakes are venomous but they 're very small and not really dangerous to humans we won 't talk about them much today as you would be very lucky to ever even see one if you do see a snake you should always keep well away from it tiger snakes in hobsons bay are not actually aggressive they won 't chase you like people think they will however they might stick their head up and hiss at you and that 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will often see tiger snakes out and about usually in spring and summer all they do is they back away and give them plenty of room to get away if you do see a snake you should always give it plenty of room to escape or get away from you when looking for reptiles i recommend using binoculars that way you can see some of the smaller animals or even some of the larger animals without having to get too close the best conditions to look for reptiles in are these kinds of conditions in melbourne you want the temperature to be somewhere between 18 to 30 degrees any cooler than that and you 'll likely see many less reptiles any warmer than that and the reptiles will start to shelter under the undergrowth or under logs to actually keep away from the sun because otherwise it it 's too hot for them and the last thing you need when looking for reptiles is patience since the best method for finding them is to stay quite still yourself and soon they may come out of the undergrowth and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binoculars i recommend looking at the base of logs or rocks or into the leaf litter to see if you can find them reptiles are cold blooded or ectothermic which means they get their heat from their environment unlike us humans and other mammals where we generate our own heat that 's why we generally only see reptiles in warmer weather and it 's why they will often be found around rocks or logs that are being warmed by the sun there are many different types of lizards in hobson 's bay we will mostly see skinks some of the skinks you 're more likely to see include the common eastern blue tongue lizard or tiliqua skincoities bougainville 's skink larista boganvillia and the most common the garden skinks lamprophola squiginode we also have a type of lizard from the dragon group here in hobson 's bay you might have heard of the bearded dragons or water dragons well the one we have here is a smaller one called the jackie dragon amphibolus murakatus it 's a very attractive little lizard we also have a species of gecko in hobson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are active at night so we probably won 't see one today although you might find one sleeping during the day under a warm brick or a stack of wood in your backyard always be careful if you 're moving things around in your backyard wear gloves and be careful to pick things up gently and if you find a lizard or snake under a brick or a pile of wood be very careful not to squash the animal when putting the brick or wood back down if it 's a snake remember to not make any sudden movements and slowly back away sometimes our team finds dumped animals including lizards such as water dragons bearded dragons and stumpy tails or shingle backs you should never release pet animals into the wild they could well spread diseases and cause problems with the genetic lines for our native animals and wildlife but also they 'll most likely die often the climatic conditions are not right for them so for instance shingleback lizards likely will never survive in hobsons bay it gets a bit too cold for them also they 'll very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or maybe foxes if you don 't want to keep one of your pet reptiles anymore please speak to your local vet about what you should do about it now because we weren 't sure if we were actually going to find any real life reptiles and animals today here 's some we prepared earlier this is a stuffed blue tongue lizard so this was once alive blue tongue lizards are named this because they have a blue tongue and they often slide their tongue in and out of their mouths which is how they can smell food they are omnivorous so they will eat berries and vegetation but also things like smaller lizards small snakes insects such as crickets and cockroaches and snails and slugs so they 're really good to have in your garden and like most reptiles the females are actually bigger than the males i can 't tell whether this one 's a female or a male to be able to sex a blue tongue lizard you need to do an internal exam and we 're not gonna do that these two are tiger snakes tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there they 're back see the stripes on this one here tiger snakes eat things like mice or frogs or smaller lizards or smaller snakes they 're pretty much exclusively carnivores most tiger snakes will also have a bit of a yellowish belly but remember you should never get close enough to be able to see its yellow belly people often think that blue tongues are tiger snakes because sometimes all they see is the animal 's head but let 's have a look at the head of the blue tongue and the tiger snake so you can actually really see the difference notice the head of the blue tongue is quite broad whereas the head of the tiger snake is a bit narrower almost the same width as its neck one of the best ways to be able to tell the difference between the head of a snake and the head of a lizard is that snakes actually don 't have ears so you can see here the snake doesn 't have any ears snakes are actually deaf however they 've got a really good sense of smell sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake has pretty poor sight but they can also feel vibrations in the ground however you can see with the blue tongue see the holes in the side of its head there that 's its ears so all lizards have ears and they usually just look like holes in the side of their head now remember never pick up snakes or lizards if you find them you should always assume that snakes are dangerous and with lizards you can actually harm them or scare them without even meaning to skinks and geckos drop their tails or in other words they can lose their tails this is something that they they can do to escape from predators so for instance if a bird is after them the bird might get their tail and the lizard drops its tail so the bird flies off with the tail but the lizard is still alive although the lizard will usually survive after dropping its tail it needs to use a lot of energy to then grow the tail back so it is at a disadvantage surviving in the wild especially if it 's attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same again now you can find lizards in your garden at home why don 't you head out to your backyard front yard or local park have a look around and you might just see a garden skink looking around for food well that 's all we have time for today but remember please wait till the end of this video where we have some resources and some questions at the end well thanks everyone and thanks for your time [Music] [Music] [Music] you,"(-37.863727,

lot of conflicting information out there and we are here to simplify things for you and your family at hobson 's bay maternal and child health service we are here to support you on this challenging and rewarding journey the pregnancy and the birth were easy i think the breastfeeding part was the biggest challenge that i faced personally my birth i had a third degree tear so breastfeeding her in the first couple of weeks was difficult just in the sense that it was hard to find a position to be comfortable in my supply never really established very well and i had a very hungry boy as well so he would fade you know every sort of two hours well i had a c-section to begin with so the milk did not flow as quickly as it usually would i suppose so that was the first challenge i had and then the obvious latching issues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i was just so so happy that i got an appointment with jane because she ended up being able to help me with how to actually get sunny to latch on properly and she was able to you know pretty much um feed pretty much straight after that now we could perhaps try something different he 'll go on okay yeah there you go so show me how you were doing it before and then we 'll go through another position newborn baby speed every two to three hours what i didn 't realize was that that counted from the start of a feed so that was a huge shock for me i just fed him every single time he um wanted to feed i just knew how important it was you know if he wanted to cluster feed which i think he did on the third night pretty much constant feeding um i just kept doing it even though it was still incredibly painful when she was cluster feeding it could be every half an hour to an hour during the rest of the day it could be anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching other mothers have no problems and saying oh you know oh i just have to you know feed every two hours because i 've just got so much milk and and you 're sitting there and thinking why don 't i being a same-sex couple um you know the only way of becoming pregnant was to to go down the ivf road um and within that there 's the roller coaster rides of ups and downs and um you think all right well we 're going to do this at this point in time well sometimes that point in time can 't happen for a myriad of reasons you kind of learn you can 't control this you 're creating a life and it 's a human life and every single human is different so you can 't control any of that so for us we learnt that really really early on we 're going to remove any pressure from the back of its head and we 're just going to move that hand this hand normally is here so we 're going to use the other hand same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from okay sometimes do you find this bottom arm gets in the way and pushes so sometimes it can be a little bit awkward to do but it just gives you a bit more time if you roll that arm underneath okay and then you just lean back with baby bull 's-eye to your nipple okay so you 're just going to watch you don 't have to get him on your job is to provide the breast his job is to decide whether he wants to have a feed i 'd say that it started to feel more second nature at around sort of the three or four month mark uh in the beginning when my milk came in i felt quite full um i had maybe a little bit of over supply but not to the point of being engorged just a lot for a little baby how does that feel yeah good it tends the worst pain and zeros no pain yeah i mean that 's a very mild pain okay compared to what 's just a one or a two i 'd say so yeah very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit so you can just kind of shift them just millimeters okay just to see whether just a little movement will make any difference to where that nipple is in their mouth just see if that reduces this arm just using that hair yes so it 's lovely that you 've got him right on his side because that enables his head to be in a straight line and him to go straight onto your breast right if babies are like this and have to turn their head it 's putting a lot of strain on their neck muscles and shortening their tongue so it 's harder for them to put a good amount okay they 've also got little receptors in their tummy so when the tummy is next to your tummy they feel secure and so they 're more likely to feed more efficiently that 's nice i honestly don 't know how anyone does it without a supportive partner i really don 't because they have a massive massive role to play and you know for the first six months i didn 't clean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than look after sunny your partner really has to kind of come to the you know to the game ready to play and and do all those things that you really don 't have time to do and you know it changes over time but certainly in those early um first few months you really can 't do much more than just look after your baby i was really lucky that my partner is very supportive and he would do things like change the nappy overnight so that i didn 't have to get up out of bed if i was really tired my role was pretty much to support her as best i can to make you feel as comfortable as i can just make sure she 's hydrated so there 's lots of breast milk for a baby i find that i have to drink about three liters of water a day to keep hydrated and to keep you know producing a lot of water definitely so you need to keep up with your fluids and the moment you will have the fluids i remember you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where exactly it is flowing so definitely that and highly nutritious diet trying to take care of myself just in sort of eating well trying to rest as much as you can exercise moderately for my own mental health just to feel good as a person so that you have the energy to keep going you have to take over a lot a big responsibility so in my case so my wife could focus on breastfeeding and making sure she 's as well rested as she can be so have you noticed any signs of when he 's had enough uh he usually just pulls straight away gets he usually feeds until he 's quite sleepy and then he just pulls off do you ever see the action slowing right down so he does one two three stop yeah slows down yeah yeah when is that enough so some mums have been confused by that because they think if they 're still doing some sucks they 're feeding but when they 're doing one two three stop one two three stop they 're often just comfort sucking right if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're asleep or not you can just roll them baby back and forth and just see and if they 're not finished they 'll go hang on one don 't go away and they 'll grab back on again and have another good feed yeah because he often it 's like he loses interest or he forgets that he 's fading yeah and he 'll just pause for 10 seconds and then he 'll be like oh wait i know where i am i keep going bit more yeah like that 's that 's him for usually he just kind of falls off yeah like that it 's incredibly important to have a supportive partner and they can help you in the feeding process you know having just having them there to burp and change the nappy you know in in between your feeding is just really nice and you you feel like they 're part of it too i think that 's that probably helps especially if it 's difficult the the self-care that i have had has been allowing sam the time in the morning to care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a walk or you know feed her breakfast now that she 's on solids so how did you feel in that position changing from holding the back of his head to this position she 's going to take some practice i think so i 'm so used to the other way if you make yourself a bit of a throne on the couch and lean yourself back and get really comfortable you probably find it 's much easier because he 'll naturally be lying on you okay what i think is important is to listen to experts rather than just seeking random advice from internet from mr google dr google and things so if you 're planning to breastfeed talk to other mums that have breastfed do a breastfeeding class know what you want before your baby is born because that helps you to keep going if i can give anyone some advice it 's if like follow your intuition on something if you don 't think you 're going to get the right outcome or support going down one avenue then try another one because there are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i come back and see you just to um kind of check in and you can see how i 'm going or certainly if you get any pain again or you you 've got any questions that 's what we 're here for that 's why i give you my email address today so that you can contact me if necessary and another colleague and also so there are two two of us that put aside half a day a week to assist mums with breastfeeding yeah no worries that 's great thank you i think that the thing that made it easiest for me to keep breastfeeding was the support that i had around me um the fact that my own mother breastfed three children for somewhere between 14 and 17 months and was encouraging of it the fact that my partner has been really supportive and encouraging of it so in the mother 's group i can say that yes it was hard to talk to people about it but otherwise professionally no the maternal health nurse was very approachable i could actually pick up the phone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fantastic relationship with her if you have any questions or concerns about feeding your baby please get in touch with us as soon as possible [Music] you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

he forgets that he 's fading yeah and he 'll just pause for 10 seconds and then he 'll be like oh wait i know where i am i keep going bit more yeah like that 's that 's him for usually he just kind of falls off yeah like that it 's incredibly important to have a supportive partner and they can help you in the feeding process you know having just having them there to burp and change the nappy you know in in between your feeding is just really nice and you you feel like they 're part of it too i think that 's that probably helps especially if it 's difficult the the self-care that i have had has been allowing sam the time in the morning to care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a walk or you know feed her breakfast now that she 's on solids so how did you feel in that position changing from holding the back of his head to this position she 's going to take some practice i think so i 'm so used to the other way if you make yourself a bit of a throne on the couch and lean yourself back and get really comfortable you probably find it 's much easier because he 'll naturally be lying on you okay what i think is important is to listen to experts rather than just seeking random advice from internet from mr google dr google and things so if you 're planning to breastfeed talk to other mums that have breastfed do a breastfeeding class know what you want before your baby is born because that helps you to keep going if i can give anyone some advice it 's if like follow your intuition on something if you don 't think you 're going to get the right outcome or support going down one avenue then try another one because there are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i come back and see you just to um kind of check in and you can see how i 'm going or certainly if you get any pain again or you you 've got any questions that 's what we 're here for that 's why i give you my email address today so that you can contact me if necessary and another colleague and also so there are two two of us that put aside half a day a week to assist mums with breastfeeding yeah no worries that 's great thank you i think that the thing that made it easiest for me to keep breastfeeding was the support that i had around me um the fact that my own mother breastfed three children for somewhere between 14 and 17 months and was encouraging of it the fact that my partner has been really supportive and encouraging of it so in the mother 's group i can say that yes it was hard to talk to people about it but otherwise professionally no the maternal health nurse was very approachable i could actually pick up the phone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fantastic relationship with her if you have any questions or concerns about feeding your baby please get in touch with us as soon as possible [Music]

health service we are here to support you on this challenging and rewarding journey the pregnancy and the birth were easy i think the breastfeeding part was the biggest challenge that i faced personally my birth i had a third degree tear so breastfeeding her in the first couple of weeks was difficult just in the sense that it was hard to find a position to be comfortable in my supply never really established very well and i had a very hungry boy as well so he would fade you know every sort of two hours well i had a c-section to begin with so the milk did not flow as quickly as it usually would i suppose so that was the first challenge i had and then the obvious latching issues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i was just so so happy that i got an appointment with jane because she ended up being able to help me with how to actually get sunny to latch on properly and she was able to you know pretty much um feed pretty much straight after that now we could perhaps try something different he 'll go on okay yeah there you go so show me how you were doing it before and then we 'll go through another position newborn baby speed every two to three hours what i didn 't realize was that that counted from the start of a feed so that was a huge shock for me i just fed him every single time he um wanted to feed i just knew how important it was you know if he wanted to cluster feed which i think he did on the third night pretty much constant feeding um i just kept doing it even though it was still incredibly painful when she was cluster feeding it could be every half an hour to an hour during the rest of the day it could be anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching other mothers have no problems and saying oh you know oh i just have to you know feed every two hours because i 've just got so much milk and and you 're sitting there and thinking why don 't i being a same-sex couple um you know the only way of becoming pregnant was to to go down the ivf road um and within that there 's the roller coaster rides of ups and downs and um you think all right well we 're going to do this at this point in time well sometimes that point in time can 't happen for a myriad of reasons you kind of learn you can 't control this you 're creating a life and it 's a human life and every single human is different so you can 't control any of that so for us we learnt that really really early on we 're going to remove any pressure from the back of its head and we 're just going to move that hand this hand normally is here so we 're going to use the other hand same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from okay sometimes do you find this bottom arm gets in the way and pushes so sometimes it can be a little bit awkward to do but it just gives you a bit more time if you roll that arm underneath okay and then you just lean back with baby bull 's-eye to your nipple okay so you 're just going to watch you don 't have to get him on your job is to provide the breast his job is to decide whether he wants to have a feed i 'd say that it started to feel more second nature at around sort of the three or four month mark uh in the beginning when my milk came in i felt quite full um i had maybe a little bit of over supply but not to the point of being engorged just a lot for a little baby how does that feel yeah good it tends the worst pain and zeros no pain yeah i mean that 's a very mild pain okay compared to what 's just a one or a two i 'd say so yeah very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit so you can just kind of shift them just millimeters okay just to see whether just a little movement will make any difference to where that nipple is in their mouth just see if that reduces this arm just using that hair yes so it 's lovely that you 've got him right on his side because that enables his head to be in a straight line and him to go straight onto your breast right if babies are like this and have to turn their head it 's putting a lot of strain on their neck muscles and shortening their tongue so it 's harder for them to put a good amount okay they 've also got little receptors in their tummy so when the tummy is next to your tummy they feel secure and so they 're more likely to feed more efficiently that 's nice i honestly don 't know how anyone does it without a supportive partner i really don 't because they have a massive massive role to play and you know for the first six months i didn 't clean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than look after sunny your partner really has to kind of come to the you know to the game ready to play and and do all those things that you really don 't have time to do and you know it changes over time but certainly in those early um first few months you really can 't do much more than just look after your baby i was really lucky that my partner is very supportive and he would do things like change the nappy overnight so that i didn 't have to get up out of bed if i was really tired my role was pretty much to support her as best i can to make you feel as comfortable as i can just make sure she 's hydrated so there 's lots of breast milk for a baby i find that i have to drink about three liters of water a day to keep hydrated and to keep you know producing a lot of water definitely so you need to keep up with your fluids and the moment you will have the fluids i remember you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where exactly it is flowing so definitely that and highly nutritious diet trying to take care of myself just in sort of eating well trying to rest as much as you can exercise moderately for my own mental health just to feel good as a person so that you have the energy to keep going you have to take over a lot a big responsibility so in my case so my wife could focus on breastfeeding and making sure she 's as well rested as she can be so have you noticed any signs of when he 's had enough uh he usually just pulls straight away gets he usually feeds until he 's quite sleepy and then he just pulls off do you ever see the action slowing right down so he does one two three stop yeah slows down yeah yeah when is that enough so some mums have been confused by that because they think if they 're still doing some sucks they 're feeding but when they 're doing one two three stop one two three stop they 're often just comfort sucking right if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're asleep or not you can just roll them baby back and forth and just see and if they 're not finished they 'll go hang on one don 't go away and they 'll grab back on again and have another good feed yeah because he often it 's like he loses interest or he forgets that he 's fading yeah and he 'll just pause for 10 seconds and then he 'll be like oh wait i know where i am i keep going bit more yeah like that 's that 's him for usually he just kind of falls off yeah like that it 's incredibly important to have a supportive partner and they can help you in the feeding process you know having just having them there to

and thinking why don 't i being a same-sex couple um you know the only way of becoming pregnant was to to go down the ivf road um and within that there 's the roller coaster rides of ups and downs and um you think all right well we 're going to do this at this point in time well sometimes that point in time can 't happen for a myriad of reasons you kind of learn you can 't control this you 're creating a life and it 's a human life and every single human is different so you can 't control any of that so for us we learnt that really really early on we 're going to remove any pressure from the back of its head and we 're just going to move that hand this hand normally is here so we 're going to use the other hand same arm as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you find this bottom arm gets in the way and pushes so sometimes it can be a little bit awkward to do but it just gives you a bit more time if you roll that arm underneath okay and then you just lean back with baby bullseye to your nipple okay so you 're just going to watch you don 't have to get him on your job is to provide the breast his job is to decide whether he wants to have a feed i 'd say that it started to feel more second nature at around sort of the three or four month mark uh in the beginning when my milk came in i felt quite full um i had maybe a little bit of oversupply but not to the point of being engorged just a lot for a little baby how does that feel yeah good it tends the worst pain and zeros no pain yeah i mean that 's a very mild pain okay compared to what it 's just a one or a two i 'd say so yeah very very good most mums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can just kind of shift them just millimeters okay just to see whether just a little movement will make any difference to where that nipple is in their mouth just use that reduces this arm just using that hair yes so it 's lovely that you 've got him right on his side because that enables his head to be in a straight line and him to go straight onto your breast right if babies are like this and have to turn their head it 's putting a lot of strain on their neck muscles and shortening their tongue so it 's harder for them to put a good amount okay they 've also got little receptors in their tummy so when the tummy is next to your tummy they feel secure and so they 're more likely to feed more efficiently that 's nice i honestly don 't know how anyone does it without a supportive partner i really don 't because they have a massive massive role to play and you know for the first six months i didn 't clean the house i didn 't cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your partner really has to kind of come to the you know to the game ready to play and and do all those things that you really don 't have time to do and you know it changes over time but certainly in those early um first few months you really can 't do much more than just look after your baby i was really lucky that my partner is very supportive and he would do things like change the nappy overnight so that i didn 't have to get up out of bed if i was really tired my role was pretty much to support her as best i can and make you feel as comfortable as i can just make sure she 's hydrated so there 's lots of breast milk for a baby i find that i have to drink about three liters of water a day to keep hydrated and to keep you know producing a lot of water definitely so you need to keep up with your fluids and the moment you will have the fluids i remember you can actually feel the fluids going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so definitely that and highly nutritious diet trying to take care of myself just in sort of eating well trying to rest as much as you can exercise moderately for my own mental health just to feel good as a person so that you have the energy to keep going you have to take over a lot a big responsibility so in my case so my wife could focus on breastfeeding and making sure she 's as well rested as she can be so have you noticed any signs of when he 's had enough uh he usually just pulls straight away gets he usually feeds until he 's quite sleepy and then he just pulls off do you ever see the action slowing right down so he does one two three stop yeah slows down yeah yeah when is that enough so some mums have been confused by that because they think if they 're still doing some sucks they 're feeding but when they 're doing one two three stop one two three stop they 're often just comfort sucking right if they 're doing that and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can just roll them baby back and forth and just see and if they 're not finished they 'll go hang on one don 't go away and they 'll grab back on again and have another good feed yeah because he often it 's like he loses interest or he forgets that he 's fading yeah and he 'll just pause for 10 seconds and then he 'll be like oh wait i know where i am i keep going a bit more yeah like that 's that 's him for usually he just kind of falls off yeah like that it 's incredibly important to have a supportive partner and they can help you in the feeding process you know having just having them there to burp and change the nappy you know in in between your feeding is just really nice and you you feel like they 're part of it too i think that 's that probably helps especially if it 's difficult the the self-care that i have had has been allowing sam the time in the morning to care for sonny and you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know feed her breakfast now that she 's on solids so how did you feel in that position changing from holding the back of his head to this position she 's going to take some practice i think because i 'm so used to the other way if you make yourself a bit of a throne on the couch and lean yourself back and get really comfortable you probably find it 's much easier because he 'll naturally be lying on you okay what i think is important is to listen to experts rather than just seeking random advice from internet from mr google talk to google and things so if you 're planning to breastfeed talk to other moms that have breastfed do a breastfeeding class know what you want before your baby is born because that helps you to keep going if i can give anyone some advice it 's if like follow your intuition on something if you don 't think you 're going to get the right outcome or support going down one avenue then try another one because there are different avenues for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see you just to kind of check in and you can see how i 'm going or certainly if you get any pain again or you you 've got any questions that 's what we 're here for that 's why i give you my email address today so that you can contact me if necessary and another colleague and also so there are two two of us that put aside half a day a week to assist mums with breastfeeding yeah no worries that 's great thank you i think that the thing that made it easiest for me to keep breastfeeding was the support that i had around me um the fact that my own mother breastfed three children for somewhere between 14 and 17 months and was encouraging of it the fact that my partner has been really supportive and encouraging of it so in the mother 's group i can say that yes it was hard to talk to people about it but otherwise professionally no the maternal health nurse was very approachable i could actually pick up the phone and drink her anytime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her if you have any questions or concerns about feeding your baby please get in touch with us as soon as [Music] possible you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",1246,hi everyone i 'm andrew today we 're going to do a quick little demonstration on planting one of these what we call tube stocks which is what you 'll be planting some of you have probably done it lots of times before some maybe not hopefully i 'll provide a tip or two for most of you so we 've got our plant i 've got my watering can i 've got my digging tools one option shovel we 've got maybe a pick or you might have a little trowel now the first thing i 'll talk about firstly is normally everyone thinks of let 's just use a shovel but when you look at the shovel and here 's our plant you can see from that there that the if you 're going to use a shovel you 're going to dig a hole much bigger than the plant now i mean that 's fine if you 've got nice soft top soil then you go for it but you don 't really need to dig a hole that big and one of the disadvantages of digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're disturbing a greater area of soil and the minute you disturb the soil you 've got more chance of the weeds going around there so i 'm not going to use this in my in my garden i 'm trying to dig a smaller hole than that now what i also you can have a look down here is that i had actually no room in my garden bed here to put a plant for the demo so i 've dug a hole in my grass and in all honesty i didn 't do it with this i had to dig pig out the big pit because it was hard to dig but so it depends on the soil you 've got as to what 's all you need but let 's assume here we are i 'm in your garden bed and i 've got my trowel today because my soil is reasonably good so the idea is is to dig a hole obviously as deep as the pot and a little bit wider of course you 're digging away you know when you 've got about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can see it 's probably just below ground level there the plant 's just below ground level now what you can do now is well the hard part usually is to actually take it out of the pot that 's usually one of the hardest things to do i 'll give a bit of a squeeze around the sides and tip it upside down you can either put your hand around like that or your fingers around depends on something like different preferences why don 't we just go like that a bit of a tap and it may not come out this one doesn 't really want to come out you don 't want to rip the top off but of course so you 've got a couple of options one option is i 've got a few rocks here i can tap it on careful you don 't lose your hot there sometimes people use their boot use their shoe and tap one down there i think you want to tap on the rock here a bit of a squash around tap like that and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickle the roots a little bit just pull the roots apart just a little bit like that and it goes now here you 've got the options to do basically different things you can either use the saw you put back you dug out in the first place often that 's not particularly good certainly around here in my case it 's um heavy clay so i 'm not going to use that you could use some potting mix um if you do that make sure you use something low in phosphorous don 't get your standard sort of potting mix from from bunnings or whatever or the alternative is you can use some homemade compost which is what i 've got here i always prefer to use a homemade compost just something with a little few a few little nutrients and stuff to help get the plant up and going again not essential but it always helps to give it a bit of a head start pop that around i 've left like a little bit of a bowl around the bottom around there so that when i get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll sort of sit in there and soak in she goes now one thing you can also do which is usually a good idea sometimes your pet your plants can actually get very dry um here 's one here for example oh i 'm digging the hole there i could actually have this sitting in my watering can or bucket or you know you could pre-water with a hose or whatever and you give them a really really good soak because you don 't quite know where that water i 've just put on top there has actually got all the way down so if you give your plant a really good soak in the in the watering can of the bucket first so you know at least the whole dirt whole root system is wet then at least you 're off to a good start so you can do that first check this pull around there now pretty well job done but what i also do i have a problem with snails here unfortunately so what i do is i have to use these things tree guards snails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also got dogs actually dogs like running over the plants as well so to help protect the plant i put one of these guards on just to get the muffins started they don 't have to stay on for too long you can get these guards from somewhere like newport lakes nursery they 're not that hard to come by and you need to make it into a bit like a triangle you 're not going to be able to see too well from this view here but the whole idea is you have to make it nice and tight because if it falls over your plant then obviously your plant 's not going to get any water or any sunlight and it 'll die and that defeats the purpose of putting the guard on the whole idea of the guard is to help protect it a bit it also helps a little bit if you maybe you 're in a in a windy area you know some of you are down near the near the beach somewhere maybe you 've got a lot of wind off off the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get them started yeah just to make it a little bit snail proof make sure you sort of put your do it around the side to make sure your snails can 't hop in underneath there that 's it thanks for watching happy planting you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

VIC 3018, Australia",18589,and um so one of my most important jobs tonight is just to acknowledge that hubsan 's bay is the land of the cooler nations who are the traditional owners of the land and also the waterways of this special place where we live and i want to acknowledge their really significant and ongoing role in protecting this special place and all its plants and creatures and in the context of a climate emergency it 's just so exciting for us that you 're here ready to step up and do your part to um putting back some of the habitat that has been lost uh over the last hundred years so thank you so much for being here and we 're really excited to work with you on this program and to help connect you to the experts that you need to help and give you a bit of motivation hopefully and a bunch of free plants to get it all started so we 're really looking forward to having on this program and thanks once again for signing up a couple of other things i need to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 'll do tonight we 're going to hear from hannah in a minute just about why this program is so important for hobson 's bay and how it connects strategically to the work that we 're doing we 're then going to hear from kiara who is just about the most inspiring example of a local habitat garden that i 've come across i know you 're going to love to listen to her and how her garden has been transformed and then we 'll have a quick break and then we 'll meet santia who 's going to help you go through the landscape design process and don 't be intimidated by that but it will just be like a common sense process of working out microclimates on your site and choosing plants to match um and then we 'll just do a bit of a cap off with some housekeeping um and i think the other things i need to let you know uh that we are recording tonight 's session for anyone who couldn 't make it and just for privacy reasons if you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video off otherwise if you ask a question verbally you may appear in it and i also want to let you know that you can change the name that appears publicly by going to the participants window clicking on your name the more button and then clicking rename if that 's relevant to you i will mute your mics unless um you 're intending to speak and at any point tonight if you want to ask questions use the chat window down the bottom to do that and we can either answer it in the middle of the session or we 've got some scheduled question time and if there 's anything that 's left over at the end then our presenters have been really kind in saying they can stay a bit longer to make sure we don 't lose any so that 's the housekeeping tonight i 'm going to hand you over to hannah briefly thanks hannah hello everyone i 'm hannah the biodiversity officer at hobson 's bay and i 'd just like to welcome you all to this habitat gardens in hobson 's bay program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's something that we 're really excited about um developing and i suppose producing to the community in hobson 's bay so habitat gardens are important for increasing local biodiversity as they create corridors or links for wildlife to move safely across the municipality by incorporating our local indigenous plants into our gardens we attract our native wildlife so you attract bird life reptiles amphibians and insects things like that indigenous plants are already suited to our local environment and they work well in residential gardens because they 're already adapted to our climatic conditions but also our soil conditions they provide habitat food and shelter for wildlife but they also develop those safe stepping stones for wildlife in a highly urbanized environment the habitat gardens program has stemmed from a community submission which is picture idea and it has been has been developed to encourage and promote residents to use local indigenous plants in their private gardens to create that broader ecosystem connectivity with our conservation reserves the initiative aims to establish that greater genetic diversity establishing habitats for wildlife food sources but also stepping stones to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at any stage of your habitat garden kiara 's been developing her garden for almost 20 years some people are just starting out so it doesn 't matter what stage you 're at the important thing here is to remember that by bringing native plants into your gardens we 're increasing the local biodiversity but you 're also providing habitat for native wildlife and you 're attracting that wildlife into your gardens so tonight our first presenter is kiara perry and um by trade she 's a qualified dog trainer and i 've seen she 's just got a little logo on her top as well but she also hired provides behavioral consultations for dogs with anxiety and aggression is that right correct yeah but she 's also one of the most passionate habitat gardeners i 've met so in 2003 she started her journey to develop a habitat garden she started small but it has constantly evolved and it 's always changing and i think it is one of the most inspiring established habitat gardens that i 've come across she 's got a wealth of knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this time through trial and error so tonight she 's going to walk us through the various types of habitat part of me that you can create in your gardens and what wildlife that you can attract cat briefly did mention that we 're going to have an extra session potentially after this for 30 minutes for additional questions so if you do have any questions we 're just going to keep them on hold until chiara finishes her presentation but you can also write them in the chat function or you can raise your hand we 've got a short time for questions after kiara and then further time later um so now i suppose i 'd like to welcome kiara you can share your screen um if you like and enlighten us on your passion and enthusiasm for habitat gardens ah where are we that 's it all right we 're good to go you can all see that that 's great thanks kara excellent okay all right so we 're just quickly to touch on again in regards to um what hannah was saying and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to encourage all the animals back to where they came from so they were all here well before us and we unfortunately have moved them on because we 've taken away some of their environment but it 's very easy to actually bring it back because they don 't take long to come back in i 've been here for 20 years and i think within the first year of planting some trees i already had native species appearing in my garden so it 's not like they just disappear completely they just basically give your place a wide berth until something arrives and then they make their way back as quick as they can um there 's new birds and there 's new animals appearing in my garden all the time insects this year i 've got new birds again so it 's not ever getting boring it 's actually excites me that i 'm seeing more and more new species and as my garden 's evolving it 's becoming more quite more fun um we 're creating corridors so that i i live in poincare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saltwater coast park so i 'm sort of in the middle and what i 've done is created an environment that at least it allows the birds to move from one into the other without having this massive gap where they can 't get access to water or food or rest so it was important for me to make that corridor available to them so they can get from one place to another and have that break um aesthetically it 's really quite pleasing to see green and field shade and just see color bursts of color from flowers so it beats looking at your artificial turf and it beats having that real barren kind of environment i had my children involved as i was growing up and as much as they 're mature young adults now you can 't take the nature out of them so they could quite happily be walking down the street going mum there 's one of those it 's just ingrained now so i love that my children have continued to have these skills and them knowing about nature as adults so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calming had i not had my garden last year through covert i think i would have gone crazy it get me motivated because i was doing stuff out there while i wasn 't able to work so for me it was my little piece of bush that i could escape to literally in suburbia sorry it has that ability to do that for you as well um i have predominantly used indigenous plants as hannah touched again the indigenous plants are suited to our environment right here so the higher salt content poor soil in general it doesn 't hold more moisture very well our rain is very on and off so we could have months and months of nothing and then heavy rainfall it tolerates strong winds so a lot of the indigenous plants here are bred for that so majority of my plants are from newport lakes as an example and i know that i 've had very few losses in the last 10 years because i 've picked stuff that is bred for the area i barely get weeds so if i get weeds it 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from neighbors but in my backyard i don 't have weeds at all so i don 't spend hours and hours every weekend weeding um i don 't spend hours and hours watering because all the plants are doing the job keeping the house cool and the plants because they can tolerate low water don 't need a lot of watering the only part of my garden that really gets water is my veggie patch and my native orchids but the rest of it is pretty much self-sufficient does its own job i don 't have air conditioning in my home and the majority of my house is pulled off by the shade produced by the trees in summer um so quite often people do comment noticing it 's significantly cooler when they 're in my backyard because of the trees and it just traps in some of that coolness as well and the soil has improved so when i first started planting trees 20 years ago in my garden it was just that horrible clay store that you get in point cook um i now have that beautiful rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful insects in there so and that 's i 've not put any stuff into the ground i 'll never use any gypsum i 've just literally put plants and let the roots do their jobs so it 's just become this one massive cycle that 's just working beautifully these are some of the animals that have been coming into the area so the pilots i 've been getting i have blue ton lizards as pets um i 've got tree frogs that make their way into the garden i 've had the nanky night here and it was last year i 've had a few moths and butterflies various ones because i 've now started planting in a lot of grasses i 'm trying to do more to attract the butterflies um and then in the top corner you can see that 's my water dragon who 's my pet water dragon so i have some animals as pets but they actually live all outdoors as wild animals i don 't live in tanks or in cages so i get to see them like in a natural environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well so it looks as real as it can be for them we also get these in the garden so i 've had all of these in my yard i 've had the geckos geckos i find them in my house and you will be surprised you 'll find them in your garden if you 've got a little bit of stuff a little bit of vegetation will get them there um the little tiny micro bats we often are hearing them this time of year they 're usually flying around under our head our power lights outside the street looking for little insects flying foxes come in now as well because we 've got the eucalyptus flowering through the night and the flowers actually open up bigger through the night and their little flying foxes are actually the big pollinators more than bees um blue banded bees have finally come into my garden and i only started hearing them over the weekend so there are delightful little bees stingless harmless beautiful to see in the garden and then we 've got all the insects of the birds so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look work out how to attract all of these into your garden they will come all right um so just again the whole idea is we 're trying to re-establish our these are natural environments so that we can you know basically bring back what 's being stripped away because of because of development um and you just have to start working slowly and it does get there if you start working at it you 'll actually make that difference and if a few houses join up and the idea is not just one person doing it but a few people doing it you create a lot of these corridors and lot of these stepping stones as hannah was suggesting so it actually all makes a difference my street now it 's not just me but there 's a few neighbors that have got involved in these programs and you can actually now see the benefits because the birds and the reptiles are moving their way up and down so it 's not just one house they 've got options so this is unfortunately what we 're seeing a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just it drives me crazy seeing houses with this artificial turf there 's not nothing there it does nothing for soil it compacts the soil in fact and what it also does is tends to create more heat because the rubber underneath actually heats up so it 's actually a little bit of a disaster for the environment because it 's not helping us in any way and trying to get that soil to recover afterwards is actually really difficult because it becomes so compacted and so dry so we want to try to become a little bit more natural start bringing on board stuff when i first started building stuff around my home i had nothing it was a block of land built a house we had lots of dirt first thing i did was laid out a normal real turf i didn 't put down artificial turf because i needed to stop the dirt coming in the house and that was pretty much my backyard at that point following year i started to create sections so i 've got reptiles i 've got turtles and lizards i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the first priority to start creating zones in my garden so that i could actually split things up and also do them effectively and also within budget you know just building a house is not a lot of money going around so we have to be quite realistic about it that 's that section now so i 've got a whole heap of dianellas there 's a gum tree there 's quite a lot of different plants in there that is a hot spot for blue banded bees and that 's just really nice and thick and i allow that to get like that because that 's how it looks in nature so i like my garden to replicate a little bit of what it would look like if you 're actually going for a bush walk and that 's one section that always stays green that 's always that height there 's no trimming there 's no pruning involved that 's just the way it looks so it 's just beautiful straight out my back door and that 's the next section that 's just little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog bogs and you wouldn 't know that but they 're in there and it 's full of frogs and tadpoles as well and that just continues through there 's a combination of salt bushes there there 's correa 's there 's gravillas and that little section there this has new hole and honey it is pretty much every day as many hours of daylight as there are the birds are in there because it produces food for them all year round so if not one flower is one plant 's flowering the other one is and that allows the birds to have food constantly that was the further point of my backyard so again we just had grass laid out just to keep the dirt down and that was that worked well for about a year didn 't take long for us to put some trees in that 's one section now so that 's another frog bog in there and it 's actually changed from where it is that was from october 2019 i 've actually since pulled out a lot of the um the salt bush i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few of the the chocolate lilies so it looks a little bit different now but i 'm trying to attract different butterflies and it 's worked within six months so as soon as i put in those new plants and they started flowering i noticed an immediate change in what kind of insects were coming into the garden and and for some reason the fairy rains like that section as well so they 're coming through into that you can see in the background as well that i 've got fruit trees so it 's not just an indigenous garden i 've got i 've got a bit of a mix i 've got a veggie patch i 've got fruit trees and i 've actually allowed to incorporate it into the garden so it doesn 't have to be just one or the other you can actually have a bit of a blend so back in the early 2000s i had young children i had preschoolers and uh and i needed to make sure the garden was going to be suitable for them so initially we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as much as i had some trees going in and i had the lawn forum they had some stepping stones they had some fun stuff to balance on and they had their playground and as i got older and they required less and less of the garden then i started to chop out more and more of it and then it became what it is now and you can again you can let it slowly just change over time according to the needs and according to what you want out of it you can see that it 's also in sections again i 've got one section along the back there then there 's another section in front of the cubby house so you can focus on those small areas rather than just all in one go cubby house is still there just so you know it 's become my garden shed now um no more kids cubby house it 's fine okay and then we can start creating these gardens no matter how small or big they are so i highly recommend you start small sancha will focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one go it 's disheartening it 's also very expensive and it 's exhausting and it 's just gonna you 're going to be overwhelmed before you start the best thing is to pick out a section focus on what you want to put there get familiar with the sunlight the rain what happens in that section and then start putting it together and you 'll find that you 'll gradually join everything up until it all flows cohesively and that 's pretty much how i 've done it this section that you can see now is where i started because i needed to have a spot for my lizards and my turtles pretty quickly as i moved home and then once that bit started becoming established it allowed shade for the plants and trees further over it started to have an effect on the soil and then i could slowly add in more and more until eventually it all joined up so that one section got two ponds um and that 's where my turtles live that 's where all animals live and it 's just yeah the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got native birds coming going in here nesting in here as well um i had my daughter build the decking so i 've got little decks that go around in the garden so i had little boardwalks so we 'd wear on the off the ground um i told my daughter at the time i think she was about 10 years old i showed her how to use a drop saw i told her to put on her goggles and a drill and a hammer and off she went and i got her to build it so it was really good hands-on experience for her to actually be able to use tools and actually be able to put together parts of the garden standing so get the kids involved all right and we can create any habitat so it really depends on what you 're after whether you want color whether you want flowers whether you want texture whether you 're more after grasses and also what you 're trying to attract do you want to attract birds do you want insects bees or do you want all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're after so again sanja will touch on this but i just want to i just want to highlight again when you 're looking at starting to get your zones that you want to start to landscape have a look at what you 're looking at from your lounge room where you 're sitting down and spending a lot of your time and look at those windows and that 's the area that you 're going to start working on don 't start working on a garden in a section that you 're not ever going to see out of a window because that defeats the purpose all my garden is predominantly where my windows are the areas where i can 't see much out of is where my veggie patch is i don 't want to look at your vegetables i want to see my garden so focus on the areas that you can see out of on a regular basis because that 's where all the entertainment will happen with the birds and that 's where you want to see those really nice the colors and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay so that 's one section there again scaling is really important you need to make sure that if you are going to put in trees they need to be up along your fence line so that they 're not going to block all the view of closer to your home we want to bring it down so that we 've got our ground covers on closest to the house followed by like your grasses then your shrubs and then your trees are on the fence phone you do have to also be conscious that if you 've got a neighbors you need to make sure that they 're going to be okay with the trees on the fence line they might not appreciate leaves i 'm lucky that i live on a corner so there 's no neighbours to worry about along my entire corner and that 's where i planted my gum trees so if there are leaves going over the fence they 're basically mulching my nature strip i don 't have anyone that 's going to be um concerned about that so do check about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are still interested in euclid trees you can get small ones they grow maximum three meters so they don 't have to become the 40 meter gum trees like i 've got i 've got one it 's a very big one we didn 't know was going to get that far all right um again just to just to stress about the difference between indigenous and native native means it can be found anywhere in australia but indigenous means it 's just within your area whether it be sort of the salt water area whether it be volcanic plains so we 're specifically looking for plants in the volcanic plains area that are going to tolerate the low low rainfall quite strong winds salty sort of winds as well and we 're looking for stuff that 's going to be sustainable in our area native plants can be weedy in some areas so you do have to check if that is a problem as well okay there are some native plants that can become weeds all right so we 're looking at ways how we can attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my favorites but then when i get down to the reptiles i go well so are they and so are insects i just love them all but birds definitely do i have a bit of a soft spot for them um they 're one of the things i really focused on heavily i wanted to see birds back in the garden i love watching them i love hearing them i love knowing that they 're breeding in my garden and that i 've created a habitat that makes them feel so safe and secure that they can so there 's not a day that i don 't hear screeching from lorikeets or ravens are coming in tapping stuff on the decking um recently i had a collared sparrow hawk that just made its way into my garden last week for the first time so i just love that i get new birds every year without fail there 's a new species um we need to make sure that we plant trees that i 've got a bit of height because some birds like to be up higher than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of density because we need to protect them from predators and predators referring to cats unfortunately um we need to have plants that are going to produce nectar most of our birds like nectar if not they like insects which are attracted to nectar so we want to have really good flowering plants that are going to supply food for everybody water is critical they need to make sure they 've got water because they drink daily multiple times a day but more importantly they bathe daily and that 's their parasite control so um i have water dishes literally just outside my kitchen window where i 'm sitting right now and it is all it 's like an airport okay so it 's all day birds coming and going some of them have select times the ravens love to come at nine o 'clock in the morning they have their bath the rainbow lorikeets like to come at 8 30 in the morning the day time is all day new home and honey eaters and then the waddle birds come in in the afternoon so it 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 30 new holland honey just having a bath and it 's chaos but it 's beautiful um we need to make sure that also we do try to keep them away from predators so if you do have cats we need to try to make sure that they 're in their enclosed areas and the birds are free to move and they 're safe so that we don 't have losses all right so gravitas are one of my favorite flowers they 're not necessarily indigenous there are some that are but i do tend to have an abundance of gravillas that are from all around australia um because i do produce nectar they 're very generous they produce flowers almost all year round and birds love coming in for these because there 's food the other thing i also find it loves the grillers as the geckos they come in and lick the flowers at nighttime so it 's not just the birds but it 's also for the geckos the eucalypts as well you as i said you can get dwarf gums now so they are small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties you can get dwarf snow gums you can get your flowering gums there 's a wonderful nursery down in mount evelyn that supplies a lot of these dwarf gums and they 're always coming up with new versions um they have the same size flower the same bark the same everything the tree just doesn 't have the same height so they 're little versions of it and they tend to bring in a lot of the birds and the flying foxes so um so gum trees you just can 't go wrong with uh you need vertical creepers as well so birds like new holland honey eaters and fairy rains love to nest in a lot of these dense sort of um creepers so i tend to have a few different types uh on one side i 've got a native jasmine and that 's generally full of little cup nests where the new hollands come in one after the other and the other one is a running postman and i 've grown it up along my fence line and the little uh blue fairy rings love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it tends to be a little bit of a magnet for praying mantises and one of the favorite foods for little blue fairy rants is praying mantises so they just basically live in there and they just munch away constantly it also makes it really hard for predators to get in there so birds like indian miners eat chicks and these guys have learned now that if they can nest in here the indian miners can 't get to them so dense shrubbery like this is really quite useful they 're also good for tight spaces if you don 't have much space you can go vertical these are great for vertical planting and there 's a little bunch of little babies which i see them all too often are just like a continuous now and i know when i 've got pear coming out with their babies my dog has to stay inside for a few days he has no choice so he knows babies are coming and we just wait for them to fledge and once we consider that they 're flying he can go back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time there 's a little picture there about the water dishes again so you can see i 've just got normal just normal bait but uh your bases from your plant pots they do need to have a bit of depth they can wash nicely they can actually dip in there but what i 've also got in each pot is a rock they don 't like to go in there with nothing to land on so they tend to like landing on the rock first and then they dive in for a little bath so you can have a look at a few of these little dishes for the birds and you 'll need to top them up every day especially during the summer because they will empty pretty quickly so have those in a spot where you can look out of your window because you 're guaranteed to see the birds coming in for a wash and a drink and these are some birds again that i 've had in my garden i 've had kingfishers i 've had cuckoos i 've actually had two three different types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've even had the silverizer come through every so often so it excites me all the time when i get a new bird musk laura keats i 've had as well crested pigeons are pretty much they live here all the time grey fan tails come and go and i 've got willy wagtails a permanent residence so um and they all get on together they all get on quite well what they don 't like is the foreign birds so the indian miners and the starlings these guys will actually all start to bomb them now so they don 't i don 't often get the pest birds coming in because the native birds don 't let them come in they don 't give them a chance so once you start the established native garden exotic birds don 't like native gardens they prefer open space you 'll find a reduction in the pest spurs and you 'll find an increase in the actual native birds all right so we 'll look at frogs so no doubt there 'll be a few of you that are interested in bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been living in my garden they appear out of nowhere they come and go i had this one here that lived for seven years in my garden in the same spot every night he 'd sit in one of my bird dishes and he 'd eat the bugs that were coming in through the light industry um i don 't go and collect them they just appear okay i 've got more in my front yard i 've got more in my backyard i hear them croaking all the time and it 's just beautiful hearing frogs poking for frog bogs we need to make sure we 've got a spot that 's not in full sun otherwise the water will get too warm they don 't like that so it needs to be partial sun because they also don 't like being in the shade if they 're in too much shade they don 't get a little bit of heat in the water they won 't lay eggs so they need a little bit of sun frogs are not good swimmers as much as you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land on something so you need to make sure you 've got sticks and and logs going into the water so they can come in and out so i 've got this is a frog bog at the top down the bottom is a pond there 's foxy both of those lots of plant matter in there so the fox can hide in between um if you are going to look at introducing frogs into your garden or encouraging them to come in you need to have no pumps or filters frogs like still water they don 't want this constant murmuring of a uh pump or a filter there 's no need to have that in your pond if you 've got if you 're going to get frogs in because your plants will do the job the plants elect is brilliant filters so some our plants in create your little pockets pop your logs in and the frogs will come in and out as they please most frogs tend to spend their time out of the pond and around on the ground in the moisture they 'll actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're breeding so when you get a big rainfall that 's usually when you start hearing the fogs broking and they will start laying their foamy masses in your ponds and you 'll see tadpoles in about three or four days about six minutes chiara before we 'd like to move to questions oh my god okay okay let me get through here all right um i did used to originally have the pond liner for my ponds but i found that with the branches and with sticks that were just perforating so they were just useless so i 'm saving you the heartache go straight to these kind of um these kind of shells so you can get them from running you can 't even use a bathtub um even your clamshell that the kids are no longer using it just has to be something that will hold a bit of water the deeper it is the better because that will encourage them to lay their eggs if it 's too shallow they get scared to dry out so they won 't lay their eggs uh you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code though in regards to depth what i 've done with a lot of mine is i 've actually put a lot of gravel and substrate at the bottom so i 've brought the depth to what 's legal and then i filled it up with the water mulch plants and water okay rocks around is really really important as well this is where the frogs are actually hiding so they like to go under the little gaps of rocks where there is a little bit of moisture bubble bonks in particular in particular like to actually also bury themselves into the dirt so once you start laying some rocks around if you 're going to decide to pull it all apart you have to do it quite gently because you will find that there 'll be frogs under there so around all my ponds i 've actually got a lot of rocks with little pockets you quite often will find the rocks on the side of the road people are getting rid of them or they 'll advertise and freon gumtree or marketplace so you can often find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start popping them into your garden and i 've got them i 've got lots of rocks everywhere and these are the kind of frogs that you 'll get so you 'll get bubble box uh you 'll get the brown tree frogs you 've got the spotted marsh frogs and we 've got the striped marsh frogs so i 've got these living in the garden i haven 't had popple bonk for a while so i 'm hoping i 'll get them back again uh spotted marsha everywhere in the striped marsha everywhere as well and i do have the um the the other type of tree frog not the southern brown so we get these we get these in our gardens if we have the established environments for them they don 't require much to get going um i think we tried this last time and you couldn 't hear the sound could you i 'll just try it again can you hear that are you having it just no okay it doesn 't work no i think i could work out how to get that going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rains uh the frogs start going into their noise so the males are the ones that make the calls they 're calling the girls and then when it rains that triggers them to start laying their eggs so usually after a heavy rain i start hearing that from my windows they can go through the night it can go all day um they 're not shy they don 't have a problem with your outside making noise they almost compete with it and they try to make more noise so i 'm in that pond there i 've got tadpoles all year round so that they 're constantly breeding in that section and it 's their favorite little spot oh next one okay what am i doing here ah there we are there okay and that 's my little tree from mr cackles he 's very cute he 's around somewhere who knows where he is they 're free to come and go nothing has to stay here except for my pet turtles but these guys are free to come and go and i love that they choose my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very cool all right do you want to do questions now or shall i move on to the lizards i reckon do the lizards uh and we 'll try and um get through this listen get some questions all right um so lizards as well we want to try to attract them back in as well they 're actually good pest controllers your blue tongues will love eating snails so snails and cockroaches they will quite happily just munch away at so we want to create these corridors for these guys to come through because it 's pretty vulnerable to pests um cats and dogs attack them all the time people attack them thinking that there 's snakes without realizing they 've got legs um if we do create these corridors from one house to another we can actually allow them to move from from a parkland and through our gardens and into the next section they 're harmless they don 't do anything they will bite if you pick them up and annoy them um their job is to just go around and just eat snails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to have access to something so some people leave little water dishes on the ground for them to especially hot days and they will find the blue tons of drinking out of them so this one here is darren he 's actually my blue ton he 's my pet um darren lives outside and has lived outside for 20 years so he 's actually more than 20 years old he was a grown-up when i got him and um still going so he has no no signs of aging which is good he must be happy okay so if we 're trying to increase encourage your reptiles to come so whether you want them as to maybe have them as a pet so that you can learn about them or whether you want to just encourage them to float through your garden we need to understand what kind of environment they need uh they 're thermal powered so they need actually a bit of sun and water to actually get going if it 's cold they can 't move they 're literally frozen as soon as it starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need flat rocks to lie on so they can sunbake to actually get their their power charging so it 's really important to have big flat slabs of rock with the gaps underneath and that way when they get too hot they can go underneath because they 're not that great at regulating their temperatures so if it 's too hot they need to come away from that um i have a lot of wedges under my rocks and i 've got a lot of layers so they can choose where they want to go and they can come and come and go as they play so they go under logs under rocks they want to get some heat they come out like if they want to disappear they go under um hollow logs are really good as well so they can actually go through the hollow logs and they can stop there and sleep there through the night so my lizards have plenty of options and often i find in all these environments i 've also got geckos so everywhere there 's a little tiny wedge or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they can camouflage quite easily through the grasses and they can get around without being spotted too well so i have a lot of grasses in the area where my lizards are and i often find that they 'll also pick the berries off my salt bushes so if you have salt bushes growing as a ground cover in your front yard that 'll also attract the blue tongues because i 'll come and eat the little berries legless lizards as well really love particular grasses so you can encourage regular scissors which are in these areas you can start doing mass plantings of certain grasses that will bring them on board and the geckos love to lay their eggs around tussock grasses so where you 've got tussocks they offer my little communal nests a little bit like what they show when you watch jurassic park except they 've got little legs that are the size of tic-tacs and they often will leave them they lay them and they leave them and you 'll find little baby geckos hatch out soon after so these little native grasses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll also get again the moths the butterflies are very attracted to the grasses i 've got a lot of these where my lizards are because that access is a nice way for them to protect it as well as through the front yard um water dishes as well really important they get a lot of water especially when it 's hot and when they 're shedding their skin they get very thirsty when they 're going to shed their skin so having some shallow dishes on the ground is enough they don 't need ponds they just need dishes um so making sure that that water 's clean some of my lizards when they shed their skin they go into the water and they actually will shed their skin in the water which is disgusting nelly loves to do that all the time so i need to make sure i empty those dishes out so there 's clean water in there not dead skin um and make sure that that water dish is away from where dogs and cats are so again somewhere where the cats and dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's separated so little dishes out in your front yard can go go mild for these animals it can be a lifesaver on these really hot days especially okay and then the geckos again you 're guaranteed you 'll get the geckos coming in no time i often have people say this and i don 't have them in my garden i was like you just haven 't looked in the right spot they will be there um i have geckos in my house and that 's how many i 've like i 've lost i don 't even keep track they 're literally in my bedroom i find them in my kitchen and i find them in my laundry i find them in my front door so i tend to walk around the night with a torch but i 'd step on and you 'll squash them um they often are licking the nectar out of the gravillas at nighttime right outside my window when i 'm watching tv so i 'm often honest watching tv or do i sit there and watch the gecko out the window so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmer period of winter they go a little bit more dormant but when it 's warm every night get your torch go out guaranteed find geckos they love layers so if you 've got layers of bark so anything that 's got bark and texture that 's where your geckos will tend to swish themselves between at the very front door i have a little pile of of just bits of timber bits of little logs and i just leave it there because i initially had a geckos appearing under there and i just didn 't have the heart to take away their little home so i 've got a little stack of people sitting outside my front door and that could be a guarantee there 's a gecko i could lift it up and see them so i am a bit impartial to these little guys you actually can also hear them sometimes at night squeaking and barking they make little bark noises when they 're having their little uh territorial fights um but go out with the tour do yourselves a favor if you 've got a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start looking and you 'll find them they 'll be everywhere just so you also know geckos are also impartial to whitetail spiders one of their favorite foods so if you do have white tail spiders you might find that these guys encouraging them to come into your garden will bring down the population of the whitetail spiders they quite like to eat them um i think that was a little video there of this little guy it was that was a little baby that must have only been about a month old it was so it was literally about five centimeters long and it 's just off it goes and they 're not scared they 're so used to seeing me out there with a torch like a crazy lizard lady but they just watch me and they 're just gorgeous all right there 's my darren i think that 's actually i finished it i think we 're done well coming at me son so he loves it um it 's i could sit in my garden all day i could i could move from where my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently built an aviary so i 've now also got birds that i 'm entertained by and it 's just i could just sit out there all day i do have to work and i love my work but when i 'm not working i 've got my garden and it 's just yeah it 's not a job for me doing my garden maintenance it 's uh it 's just it 's my down time all right well thank you so much kiara i i feel like that was just as inspiring the second time around i 've i 've got to say um i 've just noticed you haven 't done insects so they 're really yeah we have five minutes left do you want to do you want to give us the key points on insects all right let me zip through the insects okay let me do that the insects are actually something that i 've become more interested in the last few years because i as i started seeing more blue banded bees coming in i thought i need to do more here and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little butterflies coming through um and i 've seen in six months i 'd change just by putting in more of the indigenous grasses so it was interesting how quickly they started making their way in when i literally just modified the landscape by a tiny bit i also created a swale in my nature strip so i actually dug a sail out and i mass planted thermody and other native grasses so i found even just my nature strip now is attracting a lot of insects that i didn 't ever have before so it definitely can um make a difference these are the butterflies we want to try to get into our garden so it 's the altona skimmer butterfly in particular is one that 's becoming quite uncommon uh but in the more recent years has actually started coming on the rise because uh hobsons bay have actually gone out of their way to produce these environments with their grasses they have a particular grass that they 're attracted to and they 've actually been doing mass plantings and interestingly they 've increased so we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more and more to their environment um the little heliotrope moth as well is beautiful to look at just spiking with those spots and i 'm seeing more of those uh the cape white butterfly the cable white butterfly i 've seen these as well in my garden they 're coming through now these are making more regular appearances it 's not like a wow i saw one anymore it 's like irregular so i like seeing them and these are again some of the other ones that we 're trying to encourage um we 've got a little golden sun moths we 've got the cobalt wasp they 're beautiful to see a huge wasp and they don 't they 're harmless again they have a job to do and i see those in my garden around the summer and that 's just because the grasses so these are some of the new plants that i put in last year i put the stalk bill and the milky beauty heads in that section near one of my frog blogs and it 's transformed that whole section enormously so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daisies i 've started to focus on more as well and the native bluebells uh these are all plants that also once you put one in they actually will do a lot of their own propagating they 'll self seed they 'll continue to seed all right through it 's like you have to buy lots and lots and lots of them they 're actually very good at producing their own so you don 't um you just start with one small section let them take over the native buttercups again in the native ranunculus they 're indigenous you can get those from newport the native bindi weed and also the blue bells the blue this on the blue devils are beautiful um those again you can get those all at newport lakes they are indigenous to our area we should be seeing these plants everywhere throughout all these all our parklands we don 't because it 's just all been developed so we can bring this all back into our gardens it 's really really quite nice and the texture is so different and then this is how again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little everlastings and the drumsticks um the little uh thai lotus the tails those you can also get from newport i think they 're almost ready to be uh available to the public actually because they were starting to produce some um they 're lovely they will keep growing once you put them in the ground they 'll just go forever so they 're very easy to keep moving along don 't have to keep buying more and more chips and there 's a beautiful little blue banded bee so there 's no reason to be worried about these bees i don 't have a sting they don 't live in swarms i don 't have hives i actually live in their little bee hotels and if you did a bit of a google on bee hotels you can see how fun they are to actually construct yourselves um you find that you 'll hear them humming you can actually hear them when they come along into your garden they have a very distinct hum they don 't sound like a normal european b and their blue bottoms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first thing that captures your eye when you hear them is the blue bottom so if you want to attract the blue banded bees into your garden you want to make sure you 've got purple flowering plants in your yard so they love purple so diana 's your kangaroo your kangaroo apple plants they can even go into sage they love anything that 's purple so your chocolate lilies is well included your wall and burgers is what they want so think about that as well if you 're trying to attract these little rippers and there 's some purple examples i 've got a lot of purple in my garden because i want the blue painted these uh austral indigo at the top the bottom one 's the wall and berger then bottom right we have the chocolate lily so that 's not only a purple flower but it also smells like chocolate and then above that is the blue devil so you can also get beautiful scented flowers and that 's an example of a bee hotel so you can make those yourself they 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to wedge themselves into these little gaps as opposed to creating hives so i 've got them in my garden i love them okay there 's another little section just another picture so you can see um so it does look like a little piece of bush when you go into my garden it 's not a you know geometric it 's not a sort of very tidy garden i actually like my garden to look a little bit wild and a little bit messy i do trim things up when they need to be but um but i do like it to look as natural as it can so it appeals to some it doesn 't appeal to everybody but you can make it work to whatever design and style you like that 's it oh thank you so much kiara that was incredible and we just made a little um a little decision there to let you roll rather than cutting with questions but look at all that um that insect information and it 's also important so i think folks um what we 'll do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and so we 're gonna go to santia next and then uh what we 'll do is with those questions we can either stay after 8 30 and answer them or you will have lots and lots of opportunities to ask questions um in the rest of the program so we promise we won 't let you go without having some answers to them but it might just not be right now they 're all great questions um so i think we 're going to go into the second section with santia now so as you know this is a program that 's designed with a couple of parts and the next time that you come back together with us in a workshop format you 're actually going to be presenting a really simple design of your new habitat garden which might be a couple of pots that might be part of your nature strip it might be just a small part of your garden or you may decide to do a larger area of your garden whatever works best for you at this time you won 't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably very intimidating as well so what we 're hoping to do is break you down into small groups based on the size of the space that you 're working on and possibly based on the type of wildlife that you 're hoping to attract as well so you 'll be in a group of roughly around five other participants and you 'll be able to present your ideas with santia there and then she 'll be able to give you some feedback you 'll have a chance to ask her maybe um three or so priority questions like what do i do with this tricky spot that 's um got a water part running through it which i know is a question from christine or you know how do i navigate this area that 's under a big ash tree and then has a lot of shade throughout part of the year so that 's where those questions will be um well answered and what we 'll do is at the end of this session we 're going to send you a survey link so that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we haven 't given you times for that session yet so we 'll sort that out then the other thing i just want to mention now before sanchez begins is that as a council we have a subscription to this incredible service called near map which is like um satellite photography but a much much higher resolution than google maps and we can also get photographs at different times on different days of the year as well and many people find that instead of trying to measure their site by hand and draw up a map to work on getting just a high quality overhead photograph of your house is a real shortcut and to your design process so i won 't look you up unless you give me permission but if you would like some high quality satellite photographs of your property you just need to tick the right box in the survey that will send you after this workshop and i will look those up for you and get them to you on monday of next week so that 's an optional offer for anyone who would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce santia now who is our wonderful experienced vibrant inspiring landscape designer who specializes in habitat gardens of the sort that kiara has just presented to you and she 's also an educator so she 's going to just take you through the process at a hopefully a really nice entry level of setting up your habitat garden so um sanchez i 'll just invite you to say hello share your screen and if you want to add anything else about um yourself um before you start feel free to do so thank you cat i 've just got my dog in here i need chiara to come and help me discipline my dog it 's um well hello everyone i 'm sanchia and i 'm your garden design coach and today i 'm going to help you create a beautiful garden using indigenous plants my approach to garden design is holistic you do not need to have an all-native garden and i don 't want you to pull everything out there is room for exotic plants fruit trees and veggies but to support our local wildlife we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-native plants so this workshop is all about looking after your own little patch of land and rebuilding nature and it doesn 't matter if you 've got a big backyard a balcony or you 're working on your nature strip i 'm going to show you how to make a beautiful garden that meets your needs and the needs of our local wildlife now i 've introduced myself as your coach because i want you to understand that designing a garden is a process and there are four steps that you take to design a garden and i 'm going to show you how to do it so i 'm going to show you also what not to do common mistakes we will make how to plan and prepare your habitat area and what plants to put in to guarantee success so there are three things i want you to take away today number one is enjoy yourself there is no right or wrong way of doing this number two is gardening is not an event it 's not a weekend of planting and then dinner you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in a weekend have no soul gardening is a journey it 's building a relationship with your little patch of earth and the plants you put in and like all relationships things are not always going to go very smoothly but some days are going to be fantastic plants are going to die they 're going to run rampant but it 's just building that relationship and number three is be creative be bold and i just want you guys to just have a go and again just have fun so as kat was saying we have three weeks until we meet again and before we meet for the second workshop i want you to read the resource pack because it 's really really interesting and then submit a simple sketch to me and then a couple of three or four photos of the area that you want to work in i 'm going to look over your ideas before we meet and then i 'm going to start off so i 'll have seen your ideas and your design and then i 'll start off by giving you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions this the second workshop is like this sort of crazy speed dating event we don 't have much time and to get the most out of the event just keep it limited limit your questions focus on a few things that you 're really struggling with and you 'll get the most out of it so let 's go i 'm going to share my screen and sure so the warm-up let 's do this people stretching your design muscles and uh let 's uh and getting into the zone so let 's change into our activewear so let 's go you 're probably all very familiar with your 5k radius and now i want you to get out there and walk it again and this time i want you to take note of what 's thriving in in gardens parks and on the roadside so these are the plants that are adapted to your soil and your climate and when you 're walking i also want you to have a look at the styles of gardens that are out there so there 's informal gardens with curved paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiara 's got so just strips of plants sort of powers that weak through and um and sort of very sort of beautiful and naturalistic and then you also have sort of more formal designs so over here you 've got with the lamandra you 've got some repetitive planting planting into a rose and and it 's a bit more sort of simple and natural not natural but just very simple and just remembering that wildlife doesn 't mind if plants are sort of laid out in a row or if they 're informally placed they 're happy that they 're in there and then also you 've got your contemporary planting which is just really simple palettes and simple simple palettes of color and just simple planting as well so just start thinking about what do you like and what looks good and you get the best sort of idea of this when you 're walking around in your neighborhood now i do this all the time when i go for a walk i look at people 's gardens and i think about what works what doesn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this is really this is sort of warming up your design muscles and this is what i want you guys to do i 'm going to show you some photos of gardens in my 5k area and i 'll walk you through what i see so one of the biggest here we go one of the biggest design mistakes is people building a garden less than one meter if they have the space and i had some feedback with my last workshop that people said but i 've got a narrow really narrow garden bed alongside my um alongside my driveway but if you have the space to build a garden bed the smallest you want it to be is one meter because why so you look at here these guys had these guys had space this is the um the one with the hedging on the on the fence they had space they could have made it a bit deeper but at the moment they 've just got you know a tree that 's going to get awfully big which they 're going to end up sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll just end up with a trunk with these slaves sort of branches on either side and you 've got the little boxes hedged down the bottom but um you just want to what they could have done and when i look at this there was a sort of big tree in the middle of this lawn area and they could have really made this beautiful void this beautiful sort of grassed area in a nice shape which would have been able to so they would have been able to bring out you know planter shrub in front of the um the hedge and actually let the plants kind of just um you know grow to their potential so um try and make your garden beds at least one metre wide if you have the opportunity uh if you are having or if you do have a narrow garden bed along your drive or down the side of your house consider installing a trellis or growing a vine and climber such as a purple kit pete coral and also tall grasses are great and a great option along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's an ugly fence or there 's just one wanting some softening alongside the um someone 's driveway and they just have some movement and if you paint your fence sort of the charcoal color you know some of these beautiful plants they look amazing all year round in front of these um in front of fences the next photo okay this one has two things that drive me nuts um there 's only two plant heights there 's like really really tall and then really small and then the grasses are just sort of sitting out there on their own so when you get the plant list you 're going to sort of know the width and the spread of plants and out and you look out in the wild and you see that plants don 't exist in isolation so and they 're also they 're just not the same height so thinking about if i look at this picture i think gosh get some ground covers in think about different layers of different heights they 've got sort of really good ideas with this beautiful sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done so much more and now is a really good time if your grasses are looking kind of scrappy now well sort of between now and autumn is a really good time just before it cools down to just shock them off at the um at the base and um i usually get my my um my my dish washing gloves out and then you can really pick out all the sort of dead bits of grass and really tidy them up and you 'll get a fresh flush before winter it 's just been this beautiful crazy weather for uh the grasses at the moment so um so now 's a good time to to get stuck into some grasses and looking a bit sad and sorry so the next one all right pebbles pebbles are not the best mulch and i know many of you may have had inherited pebbles and really they 're just a pain in the ass and i encounter so many people who just go what do i do with them so um i i recommend just getting small children to put them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just give them away but um pebbles pebbles do not help plants grow they don 't give back to the soil you can 't add compost they raise the soil temperature and they 're really really hard to plant on and the second picture down the track this will invariably happen and you can actually see through this the weed matting so pooch grass will eventually get into your pebbles and all that hard work and expense that you put in will um be for naught what i just instead of pebbles use mulch but in the end the cheapest and lowest maintenance mulch are plants aim to cover your soil with plants ground covers wild flowers plants will keep the soil moisture in your soil and it 's habitat friendly and another thing i was just going to say is if you are mulching your garden it 's really good to put plants on the side of your um on the side of your path so then the birds don 't flick the uh the mulch out onto the path so just whilst you 're you 're growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ground covers to be the mulch and you 've mulched it it 's good to have these little plants in just to stop you going crazy um always raking the mulch back into the garden so the next slide ah the potter garden if you 're a renter you have a courtyard or balcony or if you 're like me and just sort of magically accumulate pots you might have something that looks like this now i want you to ditch all the small pots restrain yourself when you go to the nursery a large pot planted with a tree or shrub and under planted with smaller plants or trailing ground covers will have more impact than 20 random small pots and plants big is better and especially if you have a small space so you look at if you 're looking online and seeing these little courtyard gardens the ones that look amazing and have big impact have massive planters it 's like this sort of statement sort of planter and i 've just listed on the side and if you 've got your phone take a photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh for pots which which are all on the list and all indigenous to your area and um if you 're renting i just recommend you uh you buy large lightweight fiberglass pots because then you can just pick them up and take them with you and that 's kind of the same when you 're renting you you sort of you know lightweight furniture lightweight big pots you just want something that 's easy to move rather than thinking god am i going to get this out this massive terracotta pot out of my backyard so um and often i think people living in living with small outdoor spaces think that habitat planting won 't have much of an impact but it does have enormous impact to insects and also you 're providing cover for birds as they move around your neighborhood and you are contributing to the green corridors that our wildlife so much so need i 'm going to show you a couple of beautiful little um balcony gardens that i love uh the woman cassandra bromfield she 's in in new york and i just love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot just to to give a bit of height and a bit of variation of height and uh and these aren 't indigenous plants to your area but i just i love it because it just shows you that um it doesn 't have to be sort of over the top and fancy it can be simple and still be beautiful and this second picture is a designer who i i really love her work is in milan and she does a lot of balcony gardens over there i think i really wanted to show you this because this idea of bees better and getting trees into pots and making you can make create these spaces even if you live in a tiny space just remember with um with planting or sort of putting pots on your balcony you just want to check the loading so you want to see how heavy and how big these pots can be before you start sort of piling them in so just be careful and um and look that up before you you start doing something as magical as this so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a walk really look at people 's gardens and think about what looks good to you and that 's your warm-up so step two is i want you to go home sit down and have a good look at your own garden and figure out where you want to put your habitat garden so where do you start and chiara just sort of succinctly put this you want to start small and so i don 't mind if you 're planting out an existing bed or if you 're creating a habitat garden in pots or removing some lawn and starting from scratch just keep in mind start small have success with this program and um and don 't try and do the whole backyard in one hit so you 're also and karen mentioned this as well but you want to have a space that you look at nearly every day and it 's really for me who is a very forgetful waterer having it near a tap is also ideal so really this should be narrowing it down in your head as you sit there going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i can look out when i 'm doing the dishes or um or every every day when i come home from work i 'll be able to see it so now that you have worked out where you want to put your habitat garden now it 's time to sketch a base plan and i 'm going to take you through my design process and use a client 's house as an example and remember i 'm communicating with a client so it needs to be clear a little fancy but whatever you do don 't freak out about this drawing part just enjoy yourself my my example is our entire backyard and i want you to start a small start with a small space corner view yard i 'm just going over and over and over again about being small but keep it small and and also have in mind that i 'm doing a whole backyard but um just just work with me on this so i 'm going to show you my base plan oh there was another oh there was another then here these are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do a base plan i 've got myself a measuring tape and i 've measured the fence and the outside of the house and then i 've drawn it i 've also noted where the windows are so again kiara mentioned this she 's got she knows what she 's doing she 's created an amazing garden but it is really important to mark up where your windows are on your base plan because yes you do spend a lot of time looking out windows out into your garden i draw my base plans to scale but you don 't have to so in a large area like this one centimeter equals one meter if i 'm drawing a single garden bed or a courtyard two centimeters equals one meter and this is so i know how many plants i would need to fill a space and if a plant spreads to one meter on my plan i can just draw a circle of this one centimeter circle and just keeping in mind that so many of these plants on your list can be divided will spread will sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your backyard so don 't think that you have to cover the entire sort of garden bed that you 're doing but um but this just helps me understand how many plants i might need if i wanted full coverage of a garden bed so all i 've used here is a tape measure pencil a ruler and a black pen now if you 're using nema image which is brilliant and use this as your base plan just grab some baking paper and this is what i use to do tracing and trace your home and garden over it with a thick black pen and just sketch it and i 'll show you a bit later on some of the um some of the the um the plans that people on the previous program did and you 'll sort of start to get an idea of okay she doesn 't want a masterpiece but um and it 's just about having a go all right so we 're up to step three so we 're halfway there let 's recap you know the small area where you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan so the next step is to really really look at your garden and this is a sight analysis i 'm giving you permission to gaze out your window and sit in your backyard and drink tea and watch the sun sort of go across the sky or maybe not look at the sun maybe maybe look at the shadows going across the uh the ground um if it 's raining stop what you 're doing and go outside and check which areas are being protected by other plants or which areas get really boggy after a bit of rain so i want you to take note of the amount of sun and shade the areas receive and i want you to check out views like are you looking straight at your neighbor 's garage or or shared what a problem areas what 's going on over the fence a lot of people when they 're designing garden sort of looked down and looking around um in cairo 's moving um in kiara 's photos you could see these beautifully strategically placed eucalypts which were blocking out the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a site analysis you 're really just looking drinking cups of tea and giving yourself permission to be out of the garden i 'll show you my site analysis for the pro pro for this for this house so a site analysis it 's an exercise in thinking about your site now you might be sitting there going ah let 's just get to the design and it might seem a little over the top but as i work through a site analysis for a project i begin to formulate sort of design ideas and i start to think about where a plant 's going to go i 'm thinking about heights of plants what of my blocking um i start to see the shapes of garden beds i sort of look at how people use the the space you know where where they walk to um and and and where the kids use and where they like to congregate and where do they want to access really you you don 't impose a design on a garden designing is about working out the conditions of the site how people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also how wildlife will use and interact with the space as well so it 's just sort of thinking about thinking about um about what 's going on in your space so the first thing on a site analysis is which way 's north and you can see my little um my little north angle is pointing that away so that 's north it 's a south south facing backyard you also so the sun so you 've got morning sun near the kids bedrooms and then afternoon sun sort of that hot blazing afternoon sun on the western side and my little um yellow sort of smudges is where that sort of full sun hits when i was talking to the client she said one of the big issues is that morning sun sort of hitting the kids bedrooms and also just be mindful in in summer the sun 's high across the sky and then in winter the sun sort of shifts and is lower across the sky sort of towards the north so the areas behind the i don 't know if you can see my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of down here will get a bit more shadow than they will in um in full summer so having a look this is what i want you to do have a look at the um uh the sun i 've also got in the up top in the corner sort of what you know when you look at those labels and they say all right this plant 's full sun part shade you know um full shade so what does that mean and i thought i 'd just sort of put that up there for you to have a little read on because sometimes it can get quite confusing but mind you i 've got a um i 've got a chinese elm out the front of my house and it 's under planted with um indigenous grasses and which are all pretty much safe full sun on the um on the label but they 're all thriving and uh and growing quite happily so a lot of plants on the list don 't mind you sort of mucking up the rules a bit there are some that don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy of it just move them around give them a go and uh and have fun okay so i 'm also looking in my site analysis things to be kept or removed um there 's a there 's a dead tree which i 've marked with their lives that needs to go again what chiara 's saying don 't cut things up and throw them away keep them they make great habitat for lizards um you can use them as steppers for the kids or a balance beam they can be a pedestal to put a bird bath on uh so sort of sort of reuse recycle i 've also mapped out um good views which are the green arrows so that neighbors trees is you know being hidden by the but that 's a good view and the poor views which is a neighbor 's house which is a red um uh the red the red arrows and the circulation patterns which i sort of touched on before um and also soil type so this in your site analysis is something that you want to have a little look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program there 's three things that people always sort of say i don 't know what i 'm doing and that is compacted clay soil and what else have i got compacted clay oh getting rid of lawn and what plants will be bulletproof and help me succeed so i 'm going to just go through quickly go through these three things the next slide is a bit text heavy so you can quickly if you want you can run get a cup of coffee because this is all in your resource pack so and if you want me to just talk you through it then hang around but um this information i go into more depth in the resource pack so if something if this is sort of relevant to you um have a read and if not go for a coffee okay my soil is compacted clay the first thing i want to say is never add sandy loam i did a job in red hill which had um which is just sort of stick to your shoe clay and i went to the local um local um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do i how do i remediate this and he said and stanley loam and which i did and it turned to it was like concrete so that was my sort of fail so which i passed their pass on to you so never ends any loan you need to you want to put in um organic matter horse manure a little compost and this will slowly break it down if you have the sort of a bit of muscle or a bit of anger that you want to get out um grab your matic and just try and just disturb you know just try and beat up the soil a bit before adding all this organic matter on but otherwise it 's just a matter of putting it on and letting it all do its work and you might have to top it up but eventually it 's going to start to break down you 've got two weeks before oh no you 've got a few weeks before you get your plants so if you are dealing with um with uh um compacted clay i 'd get out this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compost from the nerd from the uh your local soil supply and uh get to it um do i need gypsum that 's the other question that everyone asks if they 've got clay uh not all clay soil needs gypsum um and it 's really important not to use gypsum if you don 't your saw doesn 't need it and i 've i 've got a link um to this really good guy who explains it so beautifully in the resource pack but basically it 's really simple to find out you just need a clear glass i 'm saying too but just you just need one a clear glass and get a um get dig down about five centimeters in your soil and get a little ball of of your clay rub it around you might need to sort of moisturize moisture in it a bit but getting into a little ball and then just pop it in gently into your into a cup of water and the water you want either rain water or bottled water or distilled water so it needs to be pretty clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the soil so then and then you can tell if you need gypsum or not so you need gypsum so there 's like two so it 's quite clear down there soils do not need gypsum if it hasn 't broken up and become cloudy and soils will benefit from gypsum if all the particles are sort of floating in the water so it 's simple fun to do and and and good good good fun little science experiment all i can say is it 's such a good thing to start a compost heap because you then don 't have to go out and buy compost so just compost heaps can be very simple and a lot of people sort of freak out with them but uh but i you know i 've just got two bays which i do nothing to and um and i just get soil and good soil so start a composting okay getting rid of lawn so this is the next one that um a lot of people want some information on and a lot of people are getting rid of their nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the first step to mowing the lawn um first step to to getting rid of your lawn is to mow it as short as possible and then you grab your hoe like this lady here that 's not me because i broke my hoe trying to do my nature strip but this is my mattock on the other side which is my my pride and joy and my tool of choice so grab your hoe or your mask and preferably on a warm day pull up your lawn um and then um what i recommend i think kat might have said this once she said just invite a lot of people over so put on a barbecue bake a cake uh it is a really big job um so more the merrier and once you 've heard or met octa of clumps of grass then you want to get as much topsoil out of the roots as possible because you don 't want to throw all this good stuff into your green bin you can use a hose if you 've got tank water use a hose to pressurize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't throw it away um just in the vein of keeping it small just remember that you don 't have to do your entire nature strip or get rid of your whole sort of thing of lawn you can just create a beautiful organic shape in in your nature strip or in your lawn plant it out and then the next year you can move a bit more lawn and sort of build it as your confidence grows your garden will as well so don 't be afraid to just have a a beautiful little circle in your lawn with some grasses or a little patch of wild flowers and you can just have a spade edge you don 't have to have sort of edging so again it doesn 't have to be super hard now if you find your grass is super deep rooted or spreading through rhizomes like kikuyu or kuch or if you have compacted soil you might want to think of polarization as a method and i 've got a little picture this is a veggie patch but you sort of get the idea this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week of hot days and sunshine cut your lawn really short water it spread out a sheet of plastic clear or black stretch it tight hold it down the edges and cook and kill the leaves i 've also seen solarization successfully done with old carpet underlay which you can go to your local um carpet place and just ask if you can have a look in the skip out the back and get some underlay you just want to remove this once the grass has died because it can um um it 's not very natural so you don 't want to you can just take it back to the skip after you finished um black plastic you can use cardboard if i was doing my nature strip i wouldn 't use cardboard because you might find that it just blows off down the end of the street and can cause a hazard so you um there 's a few few methods but again um wait to wait a week or a week and a bit for all the grass to die and then you can really just pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after you 've done that you aerate moisten your soil um i 've included my garden fork technique in the resource folder uh water it well and again compost or manure organic matter now the last major problem um that we encounter are plants dying so there are plants on this list that are super tough super adaptable and will set you up for success there are other plants that are tough that will struggle if you 've just put up all your lawn or you 've just started repairing your your um soil with composts and manures for example the chocolate lily is a really tough little plant out in the wild but it often struggles in gardens if you 've if you if you 've just started sort of working the soil it really needs a sort of a rich loamy soil to grow so i 'm going to show you my favorite bulletproof plants and again this is in your folder but um i 'll let you see the pretty pictures and uh and enjoy having a look at them so these are these are my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're going to grow and survive even if you forget to water them sort of you know in a couple of days because really once you put these plants in you want to be keeping the water up every day unless it rains for the first month and then the second month sort of every second or third day but um these are pretty tough so cut leaf daisy kiara mentioned this it 's you know fantastic purple flower loves just sort of it just takes over in my pink face um completely bulletproof if you 've got this sort of embankment that nothing grows the inline pink face would just spread and create this sort of beautiful deep green uh favorite they come in everlasting which is just a little ripper and again heavy clay sandy soils um beautiful little white yellow flowers uh ruby salt bush beautiful little ground cover super tough and the running postman which is this is like a brutal plant um i wouldn 't i 'd sort of sort of restrict it to areas where you just want full coverage like if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover that is going to be bulletproof but it does it does run um or even if you 're doing your nature strip and you just want a um a ground cover rather than and you don 't have much time you just want this beautiful indigenous ground cover this one 's a ripper because it 'll stay within those confines and you might just need to prune it every now and then native flax another tough one creeping booby allah and i 'll just go to the next one uh the gadinia avatar so this is this is on the list and this is probably the toughest of all plants and it also comes in a prostrate which isn 't at newport legs but if you are just sort of super struggling with an area under you know dry shade nothing grows um this is your this is the plant for you and it 's got these beautiful you know shiny little leaves um and then these are all again they 're on your list but um happy wanderer the purple peak coral p it can be a ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ripper so sans here we 've got about five minutes okay okay so we 're on the home street where we are um let 's so this was a this was a side analysis let 's go this is my concept design for that backyard um i won 't go through it too much but what i 've done is worked out which plants are going to work in sort of a boggy area which plant which trees are going to have a bit of height so they block out the neighbors fences just play with play with form and shape and heights and texture you 're thinking vertical as well as horizontal and layer and layer and layer the more diverse plants you get into your backyard the more wildlife you 'll have and so i 'm going to just skip this one and just go straight to the little wildflower meadow that i did um again this is something that 's doable you 've got the little water bowls and steppers a hollow log and it 's really just sort of ground covers um and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to think of is different shapes and leaf textures you 've got the the really sort of fine leaf and the strappy leaves and the corians that you can sort of shape into balls and then the sort of mounding ground covers in the lower ground covers so um i just want you to always think in of planting when you 're planting just sort of thinking drips i very very rarely buy just one plant it 's always minimum three and um then i go up by odd numbers so threes and fives and really just one plant and never two um why well i think planting in drifts helps your eye just being led through the garden um and also i mean what we 're what we 're attracted to is just being out in nature and when you 're in nature the same species are sort of clumped together because for pollination reasons viable seed but it just looks right and uh and that 's sort of something that uh that sort of i think is sort of deep within us all of how we how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn 't but um think of think of planting in sort of threes everyone 's so there 's the elevation um little bird bark often people will say ah sanchi i don 't want birds in my garden not you guys obviously i don 't want birds in my garden um you know why would i put a pedestal bird bath in and often or they because they eat my tomatoes but um often birds are eating tomato crops for the moisture so i often leave um bowls out around my veggie patch just so that um some of the birds have something to to nourish them um than my my tomatoes ah quick photo newport lakes nursery where you 're gonna go this weekend and you 'll have an absolute ball and this was a um a little garden bed that they had which again a lot of the plants have a similar sort of leaf um texture like quite fine which you know they could have you know changed it up a bit but um but i love these colors and the different heights and um and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this list and have a go at and the one at the back the austral tobacco it 's just a ripper plant bulletproof has this amazing scent in the evening and um and it just attracts moths and moths are great because of the caterpillars and the caterpillars are like little sort of sausages for the birds and we 'll bring more birds into your garden so we 're near the finish line i want you to walk around your neighborhood find time to sit down and observe your garden have a shot at drawing a base plan and i 've just realized i 'm just gonna say yes have a shot at drawing a brace plan and these are the plans plans that um the people on the previous uh previous um program did so this is this is what i love if people had a go got creative and had fun and i can just see the thought process that went behind these um these designs so this was one which was fantastic and she 's got their initial she 's sort of put down what she wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing this before the workshop gave me a um chance to say okay have you tried this or would you want to get a bit of height here or you know what do you need to set this little garden beds in a row can we do something a bit more organic so have a play um this next one 's well back one this one this one was great base plan um sign analysis and again great planting and this one was a ripper this lady was renting and she just wanted the this little garden bed outside her window um with some pots so some pots with a bit of height and hanging things and uh and i just love what she did so hopefully these inspire you um and uh and the most important thing is just get your ideas down take photos if you feel three to four photos but take photos of the areas if you don 't feel confident drawing just take photos and get your hose and do some um designs of garden beds and put your wheelie bins to sort of get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look out um just just play with it but the garden hose is a really good tool for for laying out garden beds and sort of walking around them and getting a feel for them um and at the end of the day just get your plants in because that 's the most important thing you can always take them out and move them um i 'm going to finish up and i just want to say thank you for all listening for everyone for listening and i 'm sorry that we didn 't get a chance to meet in person uh on the weekend you 're going to meet a few of your other people who are on this program when you visit the newport lakes nursery and in our next session you 're going to see the faces of the people who are also doing this program who signed up for this program so i just want you to know that you have just signed up with a bunch of smart like-minded good people who want to make a difference who want to create green corridors and habitat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're walking around your neighborhood and say hello when you see someone out in your front yard planting some wallenberg ears or out there and offer to share seed divisions of plants and cuttings um this is really something that we can all do together so i 'm looking forward to seeing your designs and i 'll see you in two weeks thank you thank you i really enjoy the way that you take it as a staged approach and step by step for everybody and you 've given us or what you say be creative involved and i think every time i hear you present it gives me different tips or tricks and as i walk around i know now i do little sight analysis of everyone that 's around my um area and i say i might want to put these little elements into my garden or when you see some of those images with the different plants it gives you an idea of which ones to put in to your garden so thank you for that i 'll just stop our recording one moment,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Altona VIC 3018, Australia",1531,i would like to welcome you all to my native habitat garden based in point cook i built my house in 2002 in a brand new developed estate there was nothing but dirt for kilometres and there were barely any trees let alone wildlife i always had a passion for flora and fauna but i was particularly attracted to natives i knew that if i wanted to attract the birds insects mammals and reptiles and even the amphibians that i would have to create a habitat that was suited to their needs so it was not difficult to make the decision to go native and more importantly indigenous so my journey began with lots of trial and error and in the first five years the majority of the plants that we had planted actually died and this was the result of victoria being in one of the worst droughts ever recorded at the time but i pushed on and the first priority was to lay down some grass to keep the dirt under control and it gave my young children a surface that was safe and soft underfoot then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create some shade on the house and the first were eucalyptus trees two of them survived and are still standing today proud big and very tall and they are the draw cards for the birds and the flying foxes the next area i focused on was where my reptiles live now as i had pet turtles and lizards that had moved from one house to another until i built this home so in went the ponds and the plants to provide my pets with as natural habitat as possible in this next section i have two ponds so my nine turtles have choices as to where they prefer to swim they have lots of space to sunbathe during the warmer weather as they spend most of their time out on land during the sunnier days i have my blue tons so i added grasses hollow logs slate slabs and mulch so they had a space that resembled their natural habitat as well plant-wise i added lots of dwarf gums more gravillas ground covers lots of dianella to attract the blue-banded bees and native wildflowers to fill in the gaps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lizards [Music] i then started to move to the rest of the yard chopping out grass patches as i went along and i added in two new frog bogs so the frogs had somewhere to stay holes were dug and initially i had pond liner but this soon failed with roots perforating the liner so i opted to use prefabricated molded ponds and have used them ever since i planted out all the bogs and filled them with water and i refill them when they run low from my water tank within months frogs arrived and they have never left as each section became more established the trees grew more and more and as a result the roots aerated and nourished the soil improving the ground for the next lot of trees to go in i added shrubs and flowering plants so i could start attracting the birds and at that point grevilleas were proving to be their favorites [Music] so my garden was soon filling fast with trees and shrubs so i moved onto ground covers and salt bushes to add further layers to my habitat these plants filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all no more mowing every weekend no more watering or fertilizing my garden is truly sustainable requiring very minimal watering or even weeding for that matter i only water the newest sections that have been planted in the last 12 months as well as my native orchids and my vegetable patch the leaves and bark that come off my eucalypts and cash arenas make natural mulch this keeps the soil damp and prevents weeds from popping up by keeping the soil damp the worms and earth-moving insects thrive too and they do their job to break matter down and nourish the trees this cycle is well balanced now in my garden this is my more recent alteration to my habitat garden and i am now focusing on indigenous wildflowers in this specific section the wildflowers i have here are chocolate and vanilla lilies native buttercups austral stalk bills billy buttons tails native mint bowl binds and basalt daisies i have plant guards around them because they die off after flowering and i did not want to lose where they were they also seed prolifically so by having the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot where new seedlings pop up making it easier when i propagate them with this section i hope to see more native butterflies and insects as i have noticed in the last two years that there have been more and more coming through i have also done mass plantings of dianella and the reason for this is because i found they attract blue banded bees when they flower i have a large purple patch and this is exactly what blue banded bees love every year now i have over a dozen blue banded bees coming to my garden and their numbers are growing each season this area has only been established in the last four years as prior to this i had chickens what i didn 't realize is how amazing the soil would become because the chickens aerated it and fertilized it the entire time in this section i have done a mass planting of native grasses and in particular thermador as i wanted to attract the golden sun moth into my garden i have started to see the very occasional one and would be wrapped to attract a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this has started to self-seed so more are appearing each year without any effort whatsoever amongst these shrubs i have various tussock grasses and this beautiful hardened burger that is currently in full flower and a big attraction for the new holland honeyeaters and the superb fairy rats in the background you can see i also have fruit trees so you can create a habitat garden that can serve more than one purpose it doesn 't have to be strictly indigenous in fact the native birds come in and clean up the parasites in the fruit trees which means i don 't have to use any form of pesticide nature does it for me here we are entering the front yard and as you can see i was not going to just plant up the back i needed the garden to flow and continue to as far as i could go i added in another frog ball to the front and added in a lot of gravillas more dwarf eucalypts wattles couriers bottle brushes salt bushes and more grasses during the summer my bedroom would become unbearably hot as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front has become more established my bedroom is now shaded and no longer becomes an oven i also have birds roosting and nesting in the trees all the time and there are always bursts of colour as well as fragrance from the blossoms do [Music] moving along my nature strip was not immune from my habitat obsession here i have planted more dwarf eucalypts wattles and flowering shrubs i also added in salt bushes to cover the ground and have more recently added in native mint so when you step on it you get bursts of amazingly strong minty aromas late last year i decided to dig up part of my nature strip as it was compacted and drab and instead i dug out a trench and created a swale this fills with water naturally when it rains to create a semi-dry creek bed i planted more thermiter and knobbly rush in the wet parts and interestingly canadia running postman has popped up on its own as well as a nodding salt bush so this entire area will soon knit up since the swale went in i have found more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ravens as well and this is partly because of the insects now found in the damp soil as well as the little berries produced by the salt bushes [Music] [Music] the majority of my native habitat garden has been established in the last 10 years so it doesn 't take a long time to get to this point it just requires some careful planning from the beginning making good plant choices getting your hands dirty and then some patience then all you need to do is sit back and enjoy as the wildlife makes its way back into your garden i hope you enjoyed your virtual tour of my native habitat garden and have found some ideas that will inspire you to start your own so do so you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"
AUS,VIC,Hobsons Bay City Council,Hobsons Bay City Council,https://www.youtube.com/c/HobsonsbayVicGovAu,Habitat Gardens in Hobsons Bay - workshop 1,vgAtnwtiNV8,20201123,4119.839,"115 Civic Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",14109,it started okay beautiful so an official welcome to everyone out there in um the zoom land uh my name 's kat i run the my smart garden program at hobson 's bay city council and i 'm joined by my colleague hannah camalieri who also works for hobson 's bay in a biodiversity role we 're just thrilled to be starting this program that we 've been planning away for a couple of months to deliver the most important job that i have this morning is just acknowledging the country that we 're on today and of course we might be um in some different places but i think most people are in hobsons bay so i want to acknowledge the cooling nations who are the traditional custodians of the land and also the waterways that make up hobsons bay make up a very special part of this um this community and um by way of an overview of what 's going to happen today we have two presenters for you today that we 're very excited about we have chiara and we also have sanchia and so kiara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing and very inspirational local habitat garden and introducing you to some of the plants and the creatures that are part of that place and then in the second part of the session we have sanchia from green joy who 's going to be our landscape architect and is going to be coaching you through the process of designing your own habitat gardens there will be time for questions but we 're actually going to hold them until the end of each of those presentations so feel free to pop them in the chat we know and we can kind of catch them at the end or just hold on until the end of the presentations before we can actually jump into that there 's a little bit of housekeeping i i need to go through with you just to make sure that we run this as smoothly as possible and the first thing i just want to remind everyone of is that we are actually recording this session and um the active speaker which is me right now with a yellow rectangle around my face the active speaker will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question verbally or you speak you will actually appear in that recording so if you don 't want to appear that 's fine just turn your video off before speaking and use the chat window to ask questions as well the other thing as i just mentioned before is please keep your microphones muted unless you are deliberately speaking we will mute you if you don 't mute yourself and that just makes sure we don 't have dogs and kids and any of the other chaos that might be happening in your homes coming into the audio feed if you would like to change the name that 's displayed publicly you can do that by just heading over to the participants window clicking on the more button next to your name and renaming yourself and i think that 's most of the main stuff so we 'll just use that chat window for most of the questions but if anyone 's on a phone or isn 't really good at typing you can ask a verbal question just type vq in the chat window or you can raise your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you know how to do that and we can come to you and you can ask a verbal question if that 's easier and that would just make sure we have a smooth session hopefully without too many people talking at the one time so that 's all the official stuff that i need to do this morning and i 'm just going to hand over to hannah to talk a little bit about the rationale behind this project and and why we 've decided to run this in hobsons bay all right so good morning everyone i 'm hannah the biodiversity officer at hobson 's bay i 'd also like to take this opportunity to welcome you all to this exciting program habitat gardens in hobsons bay so habitat gardens are important for increasing uh the biodiversity and also creating corridors or links for native wildlife to move across the municipality by including indigenous plants into your gardens you can attract native birds amphibians reptiles and insects as they 're now provided with habitat indigenous plants are already suited to the local environment and they work well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types and our climatic conditions of the area so by including these native plants into your habitats whether it is your private gardens or possibly even your nature strips you 're providing a stepping stone for wildlife to move across the urbanized landscape that we 're in and it in turn creates connectivity with conservation reserves so the major aim of this program is just to assist our community in creating those habitat gardens within their private properties by using indigenous plants so incorporating those indigenous plants to attract those wildlife but also creating those safe stepping stones that allow the wildlife to move amongst the municipality and connect to conservation reserves whilst also increasing the biodiversity within hobson 's bay so that 's just a little recap of what the program is about why it 's important to include indigenous and local species into our garden um and now i would like to just give you a bit of an introduction to our first presenter kiara so kiara kr perry by trade is a qualified dog trainer and she also provides behavioral consultations for dogs with anxiety and aggression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the importance of habitat gardens so she 's going to talk about different habitat gardens that you can create she wants to talk to us a bit about the wildlife that you can attract and what she 's attracted to her property and also the experience of of creating and developing a habitat garden so chiara was one of the first participants in the wyndham series of habitat heroes and she 's been enhancing her garden for the last 10 to 15 years she brings great enthusiasm enthusiasm i should say and passion and she 's got such an inspirational habitat garden and she 's great with supporting native wildlife and establishing household gardens with those indigenous plants um and as kat mentioned we 're just going to hold questions till the end you can write them in that comment section or you can raise your hand or i think it is qv is that right if you have a question cat i 'm not sure on the exact technicality um if you want any questions but we 've got a time at the end of this session to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kiara to share her screen and start the presentation thank you and there we are bear with me okay um welcome everybody thank you for attending today and today the weather couldn 't be even more perfect actually because this is really what we need to sort of get us out there and start plotting what we 're going to do and what changes we can make um as i mentioned this gardening thing that i 've been doing this journey i 've been on is definitely not my profession it is a hobby and it 's a bit of a passion i 've been into the whole wildlife native stuff from as far as i can remember and i 'm actually a first generation australian so it 's not like i 've been you know born and bred and and all my generations have as well my parents are italian so i have no idea about native stuff but it 's something that just appealed to me right from the get-go and as soon as i had the opportunity with a brand new house block it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just an experience i have learned a lot through trial and error so what i have done is not again because i 'm qualified it literally was by sticking things in seeing what survived and then learning the hard way unfortunately so the aim of this program is to make that easy for you so you don 't have to trial there for 10 years but you can actually get it right the one year um so here 's how we sort of present it and this is also how you can do it in stages you can 't do it only one go it 's possible so that 's i 'm going to be showing you today is how to get about there all right so the important reasons as hannah already mentioned it encourages the native wildlife and this is that these they were here already to begin with but because we have sort of removed some of their environment they 've had to make do and move out so the idea is to bring them all back in and it 's so easy because within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i first started gardening in my block um i had birds coming straight away and i had i had geckos coming away so it doesn 't take long for them to make their way back once the environment 's there the genetic diversity is really important we have to create these corridors so they can get from a to b so that they can actually they can breathe they can move and then we have got a better gene pool it makes the whole environment look so much better it makes the suburb look much nicer it 's nice to see green as you 're driving into your suburb as opposed to just um and it just makes it look natural as opposed to being sort of very artificial and synthetic which is where a lot of gardens unfortunately heading into this with the artificial turf and uh and i think it 's actually very calming i could sit out in the garden with a carpet it 's just so nice just watch birds coming in and and they 're coming they 're making it so much more pleasant so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the the habitats we also have less weeds so our plants are really good at what they do especially the indigenous plants so we have tinted we have a lot less weeds there 's a lot less watering involved because they 're adapted to the light rainfall my house does not have air conditioning and my house is cool throughout the summer purely because i 've got a lot of trees and green foliage that 's going around it that just blocks out a lot of that horrible heat um and the soil gets really quite quite healthy because you 've got all the roots work doing their job as well and the worms come on board and we get the whole ecosystem even under the ground improving so we don 't have that horrible clay saw that a lot of people have or does that really sandy spill all right so these are some of the the critters that you can start to attract um into your gardens um these are these animals have been so the lizards my pet i 've had parliaments i 've had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so and i 've got the frogs i 've got them all coming and that 's just purely because i 've created the environment for them and then they made their way through so this is what you 're hopefully going to be inspired by that you can get all these little critters coming into your home both day and night because some of them you can only see at night time but it 's amazing what you can find with the torch you go out into your backyard and you 'll start spotting geckos without even trying all right so just as just so everybody understands as the developments have grown our habitats have been reduced so it has been you know a lot part of it has been to do with development but we actually can make a difference we can start making these pockets again and we can start joining all those dots till we bring it all back on board so it 's not all just doom and gloom there 's actually a massive amount that you can actually make a big impact this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some areas and obviously the artificial turf is uh a bit of an environmental disaster because it can practice well as well that 's what my garden looked like well in the early 2000s so that 's the very beginning i started off with just dirt and i had to put down grass because otherwise i had dirt in the house and i had young children so that was the very very very beginning and then that 's what we have now so i don 't have any spaces left in my garden where i could stick another plant in so i 'm looking for projects now because i 've got no gaps left and i 've even done my nature strip but because i have filled up all these spaces it attracts so much they 've got refuge they 've got food they 've got access to spaces that they can they can feel comfortable in and every year i get something different so it really excites me all the time that 's another section at the moment that 's in full flower right now and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually two frog bobs in there as well so i 've got ponds i 've actually got seven ponds and i 've got plants all around all the way through shrubs and everything and i 've chosen plants that will flower at different times of the year so that i max the birds that come as well so there 's not a there 's not a period where i don 't have something blooming so that 's again another image of what it used to look like that 's just grass just grass and that 's what that section looks like now so i 've got another pond in there which is usually full of tadpoles full of frogs and there 's chocolate lilies in there native grasses um there 's a lot of plants and you can see in the background i 've also got fruit trees so it doesn 't have to be just just indigenous you can still incorporate it into what you may already have existing um you can create the top permaculture garden i do have my veggie patch and i do have my fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds that come through the native birds actually are parasite controllers so i don 't use any sprays or chemicals because the birds do that for me and they don 't eat my fruit so it 's really quite um quite useful my garden has evolved dramatically so when i first moved to point cook i had young children i had a 12 month old and i had a four and a half year old so i had to adapt it to what their needs were as well so initially the garden was a bit incorporated with the native plants but also made it a fun playground for them very sensory for them and as they got older and they required less and less use of the yard the grass started to get chopped out and it started to become more what it is now so i have no turf at all in my yard at all at all front yard nature strip included there are only ground covers trees shrubs plants so i removed the grass as soon as my children were past that stage of wanting to access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space is you can create vertical native gardens so it doesn 't have to be like a whole backyard you can just create little corners in fact my backyard is little pockets that i have slowly joined up so it wasn 't one massive project i started with one bit with what i could afford and then i gradually started to continue along so you can even work in little courtyards you can create gardens that are more vertical we have a lot of beautiful australian native climbers and you can do really well with pots as well so a lot of our native wildflowers love to be in pots so there 's so many options it 's not just for big big spaces my suburban house block as well by the way is just an average house block it 's not an acreage in a normal and we can get the kids involved my daughter built the decking most of the decking that 's around the yard around the plants she built it herself i gave her the tools i showed her what to do and off she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up with that nice yearning for nature as well and they even as they mature even when they think it 's a bit daggy they can 't you can 't get it out of it there so they 'll still be able to go oh that 's one of these and that 's one of those and then we can get something that really can create a habit that really just adapts to anybody anybody will appeal to it we do get the whole family involved so it 's a lovely part of it okay so so this is something that sancho 's going to talk to you about um but this will just get you sort of your juices flowing thinking about what kind of layout you want but it 's really important that you start working out what do you look out of your windows what do you see when you look at your windows and they 're the areas you start focusing on because there 's no point creating a garden if you can 't see it through your windows so sanchez will work with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh backyard maps for you or your front maps but this is something to get you get you thinking okay look at where you spend the most part of your day have a look at where the sun goes up sun goes down so you 've already got those those questions ready for sunshine to then fine-tune and also make sure it 's affordable we 've got to work with what we can afford and the beauty of things like little tube stocks they 're cheap but they grow fast um scaling is really important so let 's make sure that we don 't put our big trees right at the front we put our low shrubs at the front as i said closer to the house and then we gradually scale it back so we want the taller trees and shrubs towards the fence line so that way we 're not blocking the view and that scaling looks really quite nice be mindful of neighbours as well if you are putting in shrubs or trees that are going to lose a lot of leaves if your neighbors aren 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant choices you 're going to make i 'm lucky that i live on a corner so the majority of my block is not um buttered up with a neighbor so my bigger trees and my leaf shedding trees are all on my nature strip so it has no impact on anybody um just touching again on the the difference between indigenous and native native means they are found in australia but indigenous means they are found specifically within your zone and that means they 've adapted to the soil that 's in your area and they 've adapted to the lower climate the lower sorry rainfall the stronger winds we also get the saltier winds especially down in hobsons um so that 's the other benefit of the indigenous plants about eighty percent of my garden is is indigenous and i have not lost plants probably in about 10 years i 've made better choices in the last 10 years now that i have a better understanding of it and if anything i have to keep bringing things back a little bit because they they grow so beautifully and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what 's supposed to grow within your zone so it is important that you try to stick to indigenous as much as you can um in particular if you 're looking at creating ponds and little water sections because the the plants if they are not indigenous they actually can be quite invasive and they are regarded as a weed so just look into the indigenous over the just the native all right so we 'll start looking at how we can bring in birds um we need to make sure obviously we 've got trees with various heights and textures because some birds like to be much higher some not some prefer to be down low in the shrubbery majority of our birds are either nectar eaters or insect eaters so we want to provide them with plants that produce a lot of blossoms that actually connect in them that they can eat and also having some dense shrubbery so the birds can nest so birds like new holland honey eaters are very very predated on especially by birds like indian miners they appreciate having dense shrubbery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need water water obviously every day and we need to make sure that they 're safe from predators cats as well are one of their biggest nemesis unfortunately so these are some pictures from grevilleas they flower all year round they come in all different colors they produce nectar all the time these for me are what brings the birds in all the time so i 've got a variety of of gravelia that will encourage the birds to come all the time i 've got quite a few populations of new holland and also waddle birds that are permanent residents they don 't move they 've got all they need here all year round they bring a lot of color it 's beautiful the eucalypts are also really important because they 've got the blossoms but also the bark plays a big role so often they pick the bark off and they eat the little bugs that are underneath on the leaves we have what 's called lerps which are little bugs that sit in the leaves as well and that 'll attract birds like your spotted particulates so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geckos as well if you do have um any bark shedding type of tree you 'll find geckos actually live in the layers and i could easily walk out at night with a torch move over a little bit of bark and there 'll be a gecko there 's just looking at me so it 's quite amazing what will live just behind bark these are some of the vertical creepers that you can consider especially if you 've got a smaller space so one of them is a native jasmine so it 's actually an australian jasmine beautiful curfew that it produces and that is like a hotel for my new home and honey eaters that come on board full of nests all year round and on the other side there there 's a what 's called a running postman and generally it 's found crawling on the ground but it grows vertically quite easily and produces these beautiful little red flowers um little superb fairy rains find that one as a ripper for nesting in so it 's another one that you can grow upright on a trellis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as insects praying mantis love that plant as well and then you start seeing these little guys which just make you melt when you start seeing the little nests being built you see little babies and then they they fledge and then off they go and they just stay so they become so accustomed to seeing us that they 're also not even frightened they quite happily work quite inquisitive when they see us in the garden uh water crucial for the birds so they get thirsty very easily they get very hot very easily in the summer they can die very easily if the temperature goes over 35 so it 's important they 've always got access to birds um they bathe very regularly because that 's their parasite control so it 's important they can get in as well to wash themselves um i have a rock in the middle of every one of my water dishes because the birds like to land on something first jump in have a flutter and then jump out they don 't feel safe to just jump into a big dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rock or even just a little branch that goes in in the evenings i have anywhere up for 20 to 30 new holland honey is coming in for their regular bath and they make a racket and they empty that water dish and the rainbow lorries come every morning so it 's you know sit that as well in a space in your home where you can see that out of your window it 's awesome entertainment just watching those birds coming in for their baths you get to know them quite well and these are some of the birds that will come so these are birds that have been in my garden this is my gardening point cooked just because i 've created the habitat for them i do get the cookers i 've had three out of the four that i found in the area i get silver eyes i 've had kingfishers roll up the fairy wren 's come in seasonally and they nest which is just beautiful and i 've also had the loricates of various types crested pigeons are making a massive comeback so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting the different various fantails as well so i 've recorded roughly about 26 different bird species that have been in my yard over the last 10 years in particular um and every year i get another one every year something new that surprises me so i 'm looking forward to what i get next year alrighty so we can start looking at how we can bring in frogs again i i 'm i sort of love all of them i love everything there 's not a particular species that i prefer over another so i just want to bring everything that i can into my garden um frogs are another thing and i think it 's quite comforting when you hear frogs croaking and talking through the night during the evening especially summer um this little one here that you can see is actually a tree frog and they make their way occasionally when we have big storms they will find their way into your garden i had this little one in particular that lived in my garden completely free to come and go if it wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it passed away from old age in the end because uh it just suddenly was getting slower and slower and it could come and wanted to come and go and it lived all the time every night without fail it would sit on the water dish eat the bugs and then go back to bed in a little hollow log so we can attract them i 've created quite a few ponds i 've got about seven uh ponds all up from memory um you need to find a spot that 's got partial sun not full sun because the water will get too hot we also don 't want it in too much shade or they won 't lay eggs so they need a little bit of sun to keep that water just that right temperature you need to decide whether you want to dig it down or whether you want to build it up either either will work if you don 't want to dig you don 't have to and the example at the top is is exactly that i got to the point where i couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tolerate so i decided to build that pond up and what i did was just created a frame pop the pond in it backfilled it done and that one sits in my front and then i 've got others scattered throughout my backyard and they all are different i did start off with a liner but i found with a line of the roots perforating it and i just kept losing too much water so i did start opting for more of your your prefabricated type of molds um the the deeper ones are the ones that i found uh where the frogs are laying their eggs because i like a little bit of depth so you do have to make sure you comply with the council rules uh mine are not just water i have a lot of substrate in them so i have dirt in there i 've got plants in there i 've got rocks in there and then i 've done the same all the way around because the frogs don 't actually spend most of their time in the water they spend it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they don 't like that they like still water so there 's no need to worry about going out to buy any type of um pump system they just want nice clean water and with the plants they will act as your filter so you don 't have to do anything about the water the plants will do it for you again i need to stress that we need to look at indigenous plants for ponds because otherwise they can become invasive so we want to make sure we 're picking the right ones from the right nursery frogs are also quite poor swimmers so not um a lot of people don 't realize that and they will drown if they can 't get out so you need to make sure you 've got ledges and branches going in so they can hop on there and come out when they need to because they 're not designed to just hop out of water they can 't do that so that 's what i use now predominantly i 've used majority of those just because i know it cannot be perforated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i can just plant it right up as i like i can create ledges you can also use bathtub so someone 's throwing out a bathtub you can also use one of those even a clamshell will work so it doesn 't have to be something you need to go and buy and often on even marketplace and gumtree you 'll be amazed what you can find sometimes even for free so just look around rocks are really important again you can often find people are getting rid of rocks and they advertise it all the time for free and i 've been collecting rocks for years now i just i have a bit of a rock addiction um popping those around your frog will create a lot of these really damp pockets underneath and that 's often where the frogs will hide throughout the day and then they 'll hop into the water at night when they want to feed and they hop into the water at night when they want to lay their eggs usually after a heavy rainfall so pop your rocks so you can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of laid out strategic sort of like in some pathway form it can be just a natural just plopping rocks here and there you can pop plants in there as well to make them even more green but in there just next to the rocks is another frog dog and that 's here they spend their time in and out of those spaces and these are the kind of frogs that you 'll get within the hobsons bay area so you will get the bubble bunks you 'll get the brown tree frogs which sound like a bird at night time people often mistake they call for a burn it 's actually a tree frog um the spotted marsh you 'll get and uh you 'll get the striped marsh as well and i 'll just play a little recording of what the spotted one sounds like so just listen to this let me just bring the volume up you can hear that so there are frogs that live in that pond right there in amongst all that green there 's one pond and you 've got those frogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marsh so it sounds like a tennis match just so you know if you 're wondering what that noise is at night time it can be a little bit deafening when you 've got 50 or 100 of them so you do have to be aware of that um i don 't dies down i do stop oh all right move on all right and that 's the tree frog again sitting in there i 've actually had three all up i had two more that appeared last year two others that just came randomly so they will make their way i have not gone to collect them they 've made their way into your garden so you don 't go buy them you don 't have to go and and scour them from other places they will make their way if you provide the environment they just need it alrighty so we can look at reptiles and when i 'm talking reptiles i 'm not talking snakes i 'm talking blue tongue lizard geckos skinks the dragons um i personally have never had a snake in my garden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other um what snakes do love though is messy they like messy where you 've got piles of wood and debris lying around and grass that 's sort of elbow high that 's what they tend to like so if you 've got a native or an indigenous garden and it 's sort of reasonably in order you won 't get those snakes coming through they don 't like it because they 're too vulnerable um your blue tones will like that geckos will love it your little skinks your garden stinks will love it you may even get little jackie dragons um and you 'll just you 'll just start to get these lizards coming through so that 's what we 're trying to attract um this one 's one of mine he 's actually my pet one i 've got a couple pet lizards and then i do have the occasional one that happens to traffic through the front yard they just make their way up and down the street occasionally geckos i i 've lost count i find them inside my house now i find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls um it 's awesome watching the get-goes through the night they 're very very busy little critters so what we need for our reptiles if we 're trying to encourage the blue tongues to come through and the skinks and the lizards we want to have some nice flat rocks because they need that to help warm themselves up they are thermal regulated so they don 't um they don 't have a system like ours they rely on heat like a battery charger um they have to have a bit of a gap underneath the rock so they can retreat there if they feel vulnerable and also when it gets too hot they can 't cope so they will go under the rock to just continue to keep warm but not overheat and they are predated on i often i 'm one of the the call people for lizards when they get harmed by cats and dogs one of the vets often calls me to rehabilitate them and then re-release if necessary um they are very easily predated on unfortunately and the other problem they have is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't realize that they 're there and they mow over them so be aware when you 're mowing to just do a little check if you do happen to know that there 's a resident louis running around um and and also just watching out when you 're gardening if you see it don 't be alarmed i think immediately it might be a snake have a little look first and see whether you do notice the legs and the little ears and then you 'll realize that it 's a blue they are harmless if you do try to pick one up and you 're not experienced they can bite you and for every reason um so just leave them alone and just admire them and just watch where they go all righty um they like grasses as well so especially skinks and legless lizards thrive on our grasses so it 's important that we 've got those for them to continue to survive on geckos in particular prefer grasses as their nesting ground they actually will lay communal nests around the base of a lot of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that there 's little eggs lying around and these little geckos will hatch out um the vegetation is also soft so it 's not gonna not gonna hurt them in any way they would just move their way through they can hide underneath it very easily so it 's a really nice nice plant to have plant variety to have in your garden so that it really encourages those kind of species in as well water dishes as well critical for lizards lizards get extremely thirsty they get especially thirsty when they are shedding their skin so they need to have access to water a lot we need to make sure again the water dishes are not in a space where there 's cats and dogs otherwise they will be easily predated on so we want to have those dishes in an area where they can just go there have a drink and move on it 's not uh uncommon that you find even sometimes lizards coming in to drink at a waterfall especially through summer so have one maybe sitting in your front yard so if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and i don 't forget where the dishes are so they will remember it and they 'll make their way there quite regularly so i 've got quite a few different dishes for them because some of them like it a little bit deeper my water dragon likes to submerse herself completely so she lives in the pond now and uh when she wants to shed skin she goes into this dish in particular because it 's smaller and then she could scratch all her skin off and i find even the other blue tons i have particular dishes that they prefer at certain times of the year and here are our little geckos these guys are just little beauties they are so cute they actually also make little noises i don 't know if anyone 's ever heard geckos but they actually make a little bark and if they 're fighting they sometimes have a little squabble and you 'll hear them actually making these little weird yip noises out in your garden um yeah i 've said i 've lost count counters to where they are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might be able to see that so that 's a little touch of the baby gecko that i found uh just before winter hit and they 're back out already again and they just you find them stuck on the walls and stuck on the windows we just say hi to them and off it goes they are so easy to find and you will you 'll have them in your garden without doubt if the habitat 's there let 's move on and there 's my darren my beautiful darren who i 've actually had now for 20 plus years so he 's one of my pet blutons and they live long so he 's well and truly over 20 years okay let 's start looking at insects so in the last probably three years i 've started to shift my garden a little bit there 's some sections that i 've redone and i 'm starting to now try to attract more of the insects um i 've had blue banded bees appear in my garden in the last few years and and these are just absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like you 've hit gold and i 'm starting to see more and more little moths and butterflies and i 'm trying to now bring them into the garden as well they all play a massive role um even just this morning just going outside i can see a lot of little hopper flies are starting to come in so this is where they start looking for the habitats because they want to pollinate and they are important for that that area in particular with the pollination so this is what we 're trying to attract and i know for a fact that that in altona in particular the population of some of these moths are making a comeback because there has been a big planting of native grasses that they particularly require so we are seeing more and more of these and that 's that 's just purely because the humans have actually started to have an effective positive way we 've only got less than 1.1 percent of our native habitat volcanic planes that 's what 's left but we need to bring that back okay so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's taken the biggest toll and without the insects we don 't get the pollination without the insects we don 't get the food supplies for the omnivores so we 've got to get that balance back and i definitely have noticed in the last couple years the numbers are increasing dramatically so i 'm looking forward to what happens this year now that i 've planted a lot more of the wildflowers again these are some of your little butterflies which they should start to appear soon they need the plants to lay their eggs on the caterpillars need the plants to eat so they can then progress to more metamorphosizing into another a butterfly they need that environment or they can 't continue their process and we 've got these little guys as well i 'm seeing more and more the cobalts are wasp i see those all the time now they 're magnificent looking scary looking magnificent looking because their blue is just really iridescent the orchid wasps without the orchid wasp we wouldn 't have orchids they specifically are for orchids to actually pollinate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again with your uh you 're not really really critical to this area this is where they 're from so we 've got to get them coming back again these are the wildflowers so i started putting in a lot of these now and i 've got one section that i 'm really looking forward to seeing what happens over this spring spills and milky beauty heads you can also get a lemon version of the beauty heads that has lemon scent uh these are all indigenous plants they should be everywhere throughout the whole western side of victoria and there 's very small pockets of those now you 'll be lucky to find these growing naturally the basalt daisies are critical as well and you know if you 're more into sort of the cottage style garden these are the plants that you can incorporate that are actually indigenous so it doesn 't have to look like just a native bush but it can actually look like a native garden my neighbor two doors up um after many years gave in her front yard was just going nowhere her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of my workshops and her front yard has been transformed she wanted a cottage style garden and she 's put all these plants in her front and it 's amazing how it 's changed literally within eight months so she 's now got plants that are self-propagating the seeds of producing more plants she 's doing not much weeding at all and she finds that physically quite challenging as well um and she 's just wrapped and now that 's become contagious another neighbor has done the same and her front yard has transformed so you can create these lovely little cottage gardens as well and these probably boiling pots so beautiful in pots and there 's some more here the native buttercups might have come up this year beautifully the blue devils are again really really indigenous to our area the little bindi weeds they all they offer a lot of variety in color so you can have a palette of certain colors or you can have a bit of a blend and most of these will all tend to flower roughly around the same time so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through there 's some more examples so we 've got our drumsticks our clustered everlasting the little tiles at the top will pop up soon and also your drumsticks so if you 've got a bit of a yellow palette you can incorporate that and there 's a lot of these will actually self-propagate so and that what that means is that these seeds that will be pushed out once they finish flowering will actually come back on their own so you don 't have to continue to buy plants a lot of our native plants are designed in such a way that when they seed you just have to let them do their job and they will just self-propagate they 'll continue to come up there 's quite a lot of times that i 'll actually dig a few of mine up and i 'll reap i 'll pop them and i 'll move them all i 'll even give them away because i 've got so many so it 's actually quite cost effective and then just touching on the blue banded bees because they are another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anyone is concerned about bees or allergic to bees there 's nothing to worry about they don 't have a sting so they 're stingless they 're harmless they don 't live in hives and swarms they actually are very solitary and they basically just go from flower to flower loading up their little legs with pollen and just doing their job pollinating the flowers they hum so when you hear them in your garden you 'll know because it doesn 't sound like a european bee they have a hum and it 's the person that draws your attention and they are quite erratic and you see them buzzing around but you can 't miss that blue bottom they are spectacular and when you start getting them in your garden it 's like you 've had chris it 's just beautiful i have now got populations of these increasing every year and last year i had well actually over a dozen whereas two to three years ago i had one so it 's really nice that they all come through if you are trying to attract blue banded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite they tend to love purple in particular the dianella is one of their most favorites that 's their their main go-to however they will also go on uh any of the lilies or purple lilies kangaroo apple they go on the blue devils um they even like the flowers in my sage from my herb garden and i do actually also like tomato flowers so that 's another one that you 'll find them on they are just a beautiful little bee and these are the flowers that you can use to attract them so anything that 's purple colored will bring in the blue banded bees and you 'll admire them they do appear when it 's warm so as soon as you hear that get the warmer weather so they start to probably come in the next two months and they 'll hang around until the war weather starts to ease off and then they 'll head back up north so they are seasonal um this is the kind of environment bees like to shelter in so again they don 't create hives they like to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little do-it-yourself projects they like to wedge themselves into the little gaps so you can just use bamboo sticks from the garden cut them up at different lengths pop them into like a little box that you 've created and pop that in your garden somewhere and even the wasps will actually take residents in those gaps so that 's what will actually appeal to your blue banded bees and wasps and some of these that prefer burrowing into tight spaces fun project for the kids too all righty so if everybody and i 've just mentioned again here if everybody actually makes a little bit of effort we all actually can create these beautiful corridors and as i 've said i 've already got two neighbors in in not far from me that have already become a little bit caught up in this and have transformed their gardens and it 's very easy now for birds to make their way from one neighbor to my yard to the other yard so it means that they 're using a lot less energy expenditure to try to get from a to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that makes it so much easier for them so we can create these habitats i still have my children 's cubby house that 's become my garden shed so i 've incorporated that into the garden we 've got decks that go through so i can move around and step around i 've got rocks and i 've got a lot of branches on the ground to make it look as natural it doesn 't have to look bushy if you don 't want it to look like a bush you can have it a lot more orderly this is what appeals to me so i like look like i 'm walking through my little bit of bush and it is just my little urban backyard in point cook that 's it thank you very much thank you so much kiara that was incredibly inspiring and i 've taken two pages of notes um so we 've got lots and lots of questions that uh i 'm gonna rapid fire at you if that 's okay so welcome back everyone and we hope you enjoyed that um quite beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and motivated to set up something similar at home before i actually introduce santia i 'm just going to give you a quick overview of the rest of the session and and the workshop too that is coming up um so what will happen in the next session is um we 're actually going to have you in small groups and so you 're going to be doing a design task using whatever space you 've decided for your habitat gardens and in the second workshop you 'll be in small groups of about five people and you 're going to have about 10 minutes each to discuss your design with santia and also learn from each other as well and to try and make that session of most benefit to you we 're going to attempt to put you in some groups with similar spaces and similar goals for your garden so the goal is better than random so at the end of this session or at least in the next day or two we 'll have a short four question survey that just asks you what type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that will just help us sort you into those groups um so and the other thing i want to say before sanchez starts is that one of the first things to do when you 're doing a design is create some kind of a base map which is like your blank canvas on paper that will help you organize all your design ideas and santa 's going to take you through a little bit of how to do that but i just wanted to mention that one of the things i can offer you working for council is a high quality overhead photograph of your property which sometimes is a bit of a shortcut to creating a base map so i thought i would just share with you an example of my place and what that might look like so this is the sort of level that we can get to um quite easily and that means you can just trace your property boundary maybe trace the house outline and then you 'll see even some of the major trees that are in your property as well so um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drawing a base map that 's relatively to scale don 't worry we can help you out with that and send you those photographs but we 'll only do that of course if you ask us to so that 's one of the questions that you 'll come up across in the survey okay so i think that 's everything i need to say so i 'd like to introduce sanchia from green joy santia is a gardener and a landscape designer in 2017 she founded green joy and has designed gardens rooftops public parks and installations she embraces a pluralistic approach to gardening where edible ecological and ornamental intentions happily coexist for the past three years she 's been a design consultant on the wyndham habitat hero program and in a nutshell she 's all about bringing people together and connecting people with nature so i 'm so looking forward to your presentation sanchia welcome and over to you hello thank you i 'm sanchia and i would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land i 'm standing on today that of the boon murang people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emerging i 'm your garden design coach and today i 'm going to strip you all of your preconceived ideas the design is an ephemeral artsy fartsy thing that some people have and others don 't you are all here because you love being in the garden and design is just about giving yourself time to think about where you 're going to put the plants before you pick them up now i 've introduced myself as your coach because i want you to understand that designing a garden is a process there are four steps that you take to design a garden and i 'm going to show you how to do it after this session you will know what to do before you pick up the plants you 'll have two weeks until we meet again and when we do meet for the second workshop i want you to have in your hand a simple sketch of your habitat gun an idea of the plants you want to put in and we will break into small groups and you 'll have a chat to me and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback and celebrate your brilliance so let 's go through the steps and screen okay so first step is the warm up so stretching your design muscles and getting into the zone so let 's change into our activewear your we are in lockdown you are allowed one hour out of your home and you have a five kilometer radius to explore this is perfect i want you to go for a walk around your neighborhood or just down your street i want you to look at what 's thriving in gardens parks on the roadside uh these are the plants that are adapted to your soil and your climate when you 're walking i also want you to have a look at the styles of garden that are out there there 's formal designs with straight lines and repetitive planting or informal designs with curved paths and drips of plants what do you like what looks good everyone is different and there 's no right or wrong i do this all the time when i go for a walk i look at people 's gardens and i think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a garden better i 'm going to share with you some photos of just houses that i 've come across in my wanderings and i 'm going to walk you through what i see okay so here 's just some examples start with this one one of the biggest design mistakes i see are people building a garden bed less than one meter a narrow bed limits your planting it 's boring a garden bed one meter or wider allows you to plant understory ground covers and give the gives the plants a chance to grow these trees are sitting there going trying to breathe in you 've got to try and make your garden beds at least one meter wide okay so the next photo has two things in it that drives me nuts there are only two plant types you have this really tall magnolia and the grasses down low there 's nothing in between they 're thinking of layering and also the plants are just sort of sitting there on their own when you get the plant list you will know how wide a plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild and they 're not all the same height so i want you to think about sort of layering your plants um if this was my little patch of earth i would prune these grasses now is ideal bring in some plants of different heights get some ground covers in and sprawling plants just bring it to life also pebbles are not the best mulch pebbles don 't help plants grow they don 't give back to the soil you can 't add compost it 's really hard to plant in the cheapest and the lowest maintenance mulch are plants aim to cover your soil with plants ground covers wild flowers this will keep the moisture in your soil and it 's habitat friendly so the next one so the potted garden if you are a renter or you have a courtyard or balcony or if you 're like me and seem to accumulate pots you might have something that looks like this ditch all the small pots restrain yourself when you go to the nursery a large pot planted with a tree or shrub under planted with smaller plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random pots or plants pot sam plants big is better even if you have a small space and if you 're renting look for large lightweight fiberglass pots because you can take them with you okay so last pick if you have a tree or plant that 's overgrown and you have this sort of big massive green and you don 't like it don 't pull it out find out what it is look it up on the web and see what a good example of the tree looks like established plants in your garden ground the space and gives it structure give the annoying trees and shrubs of prune uplift the canopy and then plant the ground covers underneath so this is what i want you to do when you go out and go for a walk really look at people 's gardens and think about what looks good to you that 's step one that 's your warm-up okay so step two i want you to go home sit down and have a cup of tea and have a really good look at your own garden figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do you know where to put it it doesn 't matter if you 're planting out an existing garden bed or if you 're creating a habitat garden in pots or you 're starting from scratch i want you to start small don 't try and redesign your whole garden in one hit start with a small manageable area and one that you 're going to look at pretty much every day the plants you get on this program are young you 're going to need to keep an eye on them over summer so choose a spot that 's close to your front back door or near your clothes line somewhere where you 're going to see it when you 're coming home from work or looking out the window while you do the dishes and near a tap is also ideal so hopefully that kind of narrows it down for you so you 've picked your spot and now it 's time to sketch your base plan i 'm going to take you through my design process and use a client 's house as an example just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a little clear and a little bit fancy but you 're doing this for yourself so only you need to understand it so don 't freak out about this drawing part and just enjoy yourself so just share that share the screen so here is a simple base plan i 've got myself a measuring tape and i 've measured the fence which is this outside line and also i 've drawn the house which is here and i 've just drawn it on a piece of paper i 've also noted where the windows are because you spend a lot of time in your house looking out in your garden so i want to know what will i be looking at when i 'm sitting in my living room i draw my base plans to scale so for a large area like this i just have a ruler and one centimeter equals one meter and if i 'm drawing a single garden bed or a courtyard or balcony two centimeters equals one meter this is so i know how many plants i will need to fill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan i can just draw a one meter circle so all i 've used here is a tape measure a pencil a ruler and a black pen and if you 're using the near-map image as your base plan grab some baking paper so all i use is baking paper to trace and then all i do is trace the home and garden and then go over it with a heavy black pen so that 's your base plan all right so step three and we are halfway so nearly nearly through okay i 'm going to recap so you know where you want to plant your habitat garden and you 've drawn your base plan and the next step is to really really look at your garden and this is called a site analysis and this step also involves drinking cups of tea i want you to look at your proposed garden in the morning at lunchtime and in the afternoon you 're all home lockdown is perfect for sight analysis what i want you to take note of is the amount of sun and shade the area receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeking over your fence what 's going on i 'm going to show you my site analysis for the project so you 'll get an idea of the steps that i take but it 's a little over top for what i want you to do but it 's you 'll give you an idea a bit of an idea of what what i do with the side analysis so this is my side analysis and it 's really is an exercise to think about your site this may seem over the top but as i work through a site analysis for a project i begin to formulate my ideas i start to see the shapes of garden beds the heights of plants and the feeling of the garden you don 't want to impose a design on a garden designing is about working out what the conditions of the site are and how people will use connect and interact with the space so let 's work through the site analysis so the first thing i was trying to always find out is which way is north so i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the east so this is the morning sun the clients kids bedrooms that was on the east side and the kids were waking up sort of five o 'clock in the morning on a summer day so they wanted me to address this problem so this is your morning sun and down here is the afternoon sun so in summer this is your sort of hot afternoon sun i 've also marked where this sort of yellow area is the the hot area and then over here it 's quite a shady area i 've also marked where there 's a bit of a problem area so this is like a boggy wet space which uh they just can 't quite drain don 't know what 's going on there 's something something to think about whether i should well what plants should go there what plants like with wet wet feet i 'm also trying to work out what the views are from the windows and from the doorway so these little red arrows here are poor views so this here was the neighbor 's roof line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views so a a tree in your neighbor 's yard or three neighbors over can bring something to your garden uh these people have put the trampoline in front of the tree but this is it was a beautiful tree and you have the sort of hiding the tree so this is i sort of think well maybe i should move that out the way over here was the uh neighbors uh shed which was abutting the back of their fence and it was just ugly so again i 'm just thinking maybe bring some height in there to block out that fence and improve the view i 've also labelled plants that i want to keep i 'm a big sort of supporter of trying to keep most plants so the plants that you get on this program are very small and you don 't want to just pull everything out because the existing plants are going to protect those young plants as they grow and give them shelter and then as you as you go in a couple of years time you want to shift or move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do that but try and keep what you 've got and work with what you 've got so these were just weeping lillypillies and so we 're going to keep those and this was a dead tree over here so um the kids loved playing around but it was dangerous so we 'll remove that don 't throw everything out a dead tree is perfect for this for creating a habitat garden you can use the branches and trunk as logs in your garden for habitat for lizards lizards and skinks you can leave the the trunk and as a stump and then have a have a water bowl on that or you can have balance beans for kids or steppers through your garden or the kids can play with a um with a make a tp out of the branches you can use reuse recycle so i 've also marked the um sort of pedestrian circulation so this kind of helps me understand where to put the garden beds because people want to people are going to take the naturally the sort of the direct course and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work their garden so there 's a laundry there clothesline there they come around here this is the back door and then the kids love to hide behind this dead tree and up to the trampoline so that 's my side analysis also looking at your soil is really important as as kiara was saying the plants on this list are indigenous to your garden so they 're going to adapt very well to what your soil conditions are my sort of theory is if you 've got sort of three to five percent organic matter in your soil don 't do anything just dig a hole get a handful of compost pop it in and that 'll give the plants the best start it can get if you 've got a compacted soil you might be thinking of doing a no deep garden instead of of and then as it breaks down you 'll improve the condition of your soil drainage is another thing to consider digging a hole pouring a bucket of water in there and seeing how the water percolates through the soil is important but again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil and your garden so you shouldn 't have too much problems getting them in there 's a lot of i could go for another hour about soil but there 's a lot of really good information on the internet abc gardening has some great things about gypsum um ph and uh but really most of you will have not have to do anything like cara said get them in and they will grow the other thing that um i 'm a big believer in and is it 's recycling reusing and starting a compost heap so even the compost heaps don 't have to be fancy even just digging a hole or just putting a parlance in the corner where you put all your vegetable matter on your organic matter this is in six to sort of 12 months you 're going to have this beautiful rich compost that you can dig into your soil and just build the soil so i 'm a big believer in starting a compost heap and it 's not hard to do all right so we 're on the last we 're on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the last step is drawing and this is where doing your design and this is where you grab your baking paper or trace paper lay it over your base plan and get your ideas down have fun make mistakes be bold it doesn 't have to be pretty a beautiful habitat garden is not a bird 's eye 2d drawing a beautiful garden is a growing changing space this step is about getting ideas on paper and thinking about the shapes of your garden beds and heights of plants if you 're having trouble getting your design down on paper get out into your garden and grab your hose your hose yes your hose the hose is perfect it 's long and stiff enough to hold a curve i want you to lay it on the ground and experiment with garden bed shapes feel what it 's like to walk around a curved garden bed or down a straight path i also get my wheelie bins out and plays with plays that play with shapes and height what does the bed look like when you look throughout through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a potted garden move pots around and find balance think vertical as well as horizontal maximize your green space by installing planter boxes or tiered shelving hanging baskets with trailing ground covers also create vertical greenery you don 't want just a line of pots on the ground vertical lines in your garden like hanging pots or tall shrubs or a birdhouse on a pole moves the eye up and makes your space feel larger by planting indigenous plants in pots you are helping connect a web of green across our landscape it 's important so don 't feel like because you 're in a small space or a balcony or a courtyard that you 're not making a difference that you are i will now show you my concept plan for the garden and walk you through how i solve some of the problems that came up in the side analysis okay so this is my this is my concept and planting plan for the project so what i was looking at was we 'll start here so with the just to try and alleviate the the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up a pergola with a climbing climbing vine over the top this area was sort of uh was a bit sort of damp and dusky so i put down some dichondra i 'm not going to go too much into the plant names i 'll just talk about shape and form and math in this one because um and i 've got this in the resource list so it has all the all the plant names that i used um over here was the uh was a tree that liked having wet feet and um and plants that sort of didn 't mind a bit of inundation these plants here were the courier so i had this sort of are a bit for formal planting and corians really shape really well so you can prune them and shape them and i had this idea of having like a almost like a cloud prince rove courier so when you looked out the window you just had this sort of beautiful undulating undulating line and then grasses this family had two young boys and so they wanted to keep the lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here a little wildflower meadow um so this was quite sort of low planting and then behind this is is the taller planting which which sort of covered the fence but this was a reserve back here so you could still see through see over the fence and to the trees in the in the distance um so here a little y float for that flower meadow and then i have this kind of little path here for the boys to sort of run run behind the um run behind the wildflower meadow and really immerse themselves in nature and just sort of feel like they 're stepping into this almost this wildness of this little passage of wildness and then it tucks around here to the back of the cubby house that they had and again it 's like this little place to hide i 've got my um i put a bird bath just in front of the window near the um living room so you can just sit and look out your window and see the birds um in the bird bath um a few taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the house just to give it a bit of shade but not a dense sort of canopy tree i use the um banksia and uh and then just town in the corner i put the um tree violet which has a really sparky sort of um branches and uh put that there because it 's really important for habitat for birds for them to um to feel safe but i also wanted to keep it away from the kids so that 's tucked away to the side um yeah so that 's my that was my designer so move this out of it as well just to because this was quite a small space just so they could sit sit at the back and have a cup of tea and uh and just sort of enjoy the view i 'll show you a little close-up this is a little close-up of the wildflower meadow so if you 're doing just one single garden bed this um this might be what you what you come up with with your plan so this i did two centimeters equals one meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of when i 'm designing a garden bed is we 're thinking about texture foliage shape and heights now usually i put my sort of because people are walking right around this i 'm putting my taller plants through the middle and my lower plants and ground covers and sprawling plants towards the edge i 've also put a little water bowl on a pedestal there at home i 've just got a stump with a um a water bowl on it and also a hollow log or a little log just for a bit to bring in some habitat um some rock steppers to help you fill and change the water in the water bowl but also planting rocks with just little dips i 'm also a a collector of rocks with little dips they 'll capture the water and they can be used for as a little um place for for insects and bees to to drink out of as well when i 'm designing um i always think of if i 'm so if i 'm designing a a natural garden or a more informal garden i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fives rarely do i ever just plant one plant and never do i plant two plants this is sorry this is kind of um this is like the one meter rule of the one that don 't have anything bigger than a uh a garden bed less than one meter this is just it just looks good and uh and if you stick to this rule of threes and fives i think you can 't do any wrong um so that 's the that was that 's the uh little wildflower meadow and this is just a little elevation so this is what my um this is what i 'm looking at so different texture different strappy you 've got the diana and the really fine grasses and the um wildflower the little wallenbergia down there so it 's really it 's just getting different textures different foliage different color and sort of and it leads your eye through the garden bed okay so we 're near the finish line and so i 'm just a recap i want you to go for a walk around your garden around your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a shot at drawing a base plan and also want you to have a crack at drawing a design and selecting some plants for your garden i 'm also very happy for you to show me photographs of the area you want to work with and images of your hose laid out we can work with that and it 's what just bring along what you can and finally i want you to have fun the overall objective of this process is to get your plants in and start a garden remember plants can be moved every gardener makes mistakes in a year 's time you might look at something in the ah i shouldn 't have put that there and that 's okay because you can dig it up and move it i 'm gonna leave you today with two things and this is my favorite quote and i 'll bring this up and the second is a picture of a beautiful wildflower meadows here so all the plants you see here are on the list so have fun with your design get your ideas down on paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is to get your plants in you can make a difference and you can make a habitat garden and so i 'm looking forward to seeing all your designs see you in two weeks thank you thank you santia for your presentation it was a nice way to have a little walk through garden design and different elements for people to consider and just some little homework tasks or things to consider i suppose over the next two weeks before we see everyone i 'm just going to stop the recording and then we 'll go through and see if there 's any questions that have been asked,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Australia",1183,[Music] hi everyone i 'm andrew i 'm one of the conservation rangers here at hobson 's bay council and today we 're going to look at one of the more iconic sort of a australian plants it 's up behind me here it 's actually a eucalyptus tricarpa others will know it as a red ironbark tree and someone will just know them as a gumtrees i 'm just going to tell you a couple of things today about how these trees have managed to adapt over the years to cope with the tough australian environment and what we 're going to do today is we 're going to start with looking at the leaves now before i look too close to the leaves i just want you to sort of picture yourself for a moment you could be sunbaking down on the beach nice warm day or you could be standing up like i am now which way do you think you 'd actually get hotter well the answer is is lying down if you look at myself now you can see that oh there 's a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit of my head a little with my feet all right now i 'm going to come and lie down pretend i 'm sunbaking for a minute i 'm down like this you can see that i 'm covered in sun here there 's a lot more sun on me here than when i was standing up so logically it goes that i 'm getting hotter like this and the tree doesn 't actually want to get hotter we 'll hop up again and let 's have a look at the leaves you can see without even getting in close with the camera here the leaves all hang downwards it 's like when i 'm standing up doesn 't it that 's what the tree tree 's doing pretending it 's standing up now if i 'm down at the beach there and it 's really hot i might be getting hot and sweaty i can go and get a get a drink i can maybe go and get an ice cream and go for a swim there 's lots of things i can do isn 't there but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a drink whenever it wants so what it tries to do is to try and avoid getting hot in the first place and hot and avoid losing moisture or water in the first place so having the leaf hang down is one way that these eucalyptus trees or gum trees have adapted with the environment okay now let 's talk about the flowers for a minute now we normally think of flowers as being these big colorful things with petals what the petals do on most plants is the petals protect the reproductive organs the bits inside that have all the pollen and the nectar that the animal the animals come to get to help spread the seed around right now what the eucalyptus tree does it doesn 't actually have petals it uses another technique if you have a look up here with my hand is up here you can see some buds up here and a few flowers up here now what actually happens i 'm not sure how close suzette can get get there with the camera is but you can see we 've got on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap on top a little cap up there another one where the cap looks like it 's just come off and the final one here would have been flowers all opened up what 's actually happening with the plant here is that this eucalyptus tree rather than just constantly flowering for a long while it waits till the reproductive organs in here they 're actually ready to pollinate ready to be available for animals whether it 's birds or insects or things to come and get the pond and maybe wait for the weather conditions to be right as well and then what it does it drops its little cap the flowers open up and then it goes on to spread its pollen around so what the caps really doing is it 's actually protecting the flower or those reproductive organs as long as possible now the final part of the tree i want to talk about today was the bark it might be a little bit hard to pick up on camera here but the ironbark tree here has extremely thick heavy bark now there 's a reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever been to maybe say where there 's been a bush fire and you go along and there 's everything 's been burned all the all the all the leaves all the little branches they 've all been burnt off so look although it looks like the tree 's all dead when you 've been to a bushfire zone and it 's all black and everything after a little while you 'll notice that little green shoots start coming out now what 's actually happened is that the bark on these eucalyptus trees is actually so thick and so tough when the bushfire 's gone through sure it might have burnt some bark and it might have burned a few leaves and edges off but it actually hasn 't killed the living part of the tree inside so the bark what it 's actually doing is it 's protecting that heartwood or the living part of the tree and allowing it to regrow so it 's really really smart and a lot of eucalyptus trees not all of them australia have a similar type of structure with thick bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one in particular here it 's historically always been found in areas where fires have been common way back many many hundreds of years ago so over the years have adapted to be able to handle the fire that comes through the only other final thing is there 's a tree being burned what do you reckon i 'll run my hand over here i mean everyone thinks these trees are being burnt my hand you reckon if that had been burnt in my hand we were black with all the charcoal wouldn 't it but no it hasn 't actually been burnt it 's just one of the features of the tree that actually has this blackish bark so again you might be able to you know trick your friends up next time and ask me if it 's been burned or not normal we always say yes but in actual fact it hasn 't that 's it from me today have a great day and hopefully we 'll catch you out in one of our parks sometime [Music] [Music] you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

much miley for joining me today thanks colleen how how how are you i think it 's probably the first good question to start with how are you feeling how are you doing uh yeah i 'm actually okay today but before we start maybe i would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the people of the coordination that i 'm leaving and speaking to you today and as we share the knowledge in community environment may we also pay respect to elders both past and present and assisted their knowledge and experience hold the key to the success of future generations so i 'm i 'm quite happy actually today who have opportunity to talk to you and to the people at the hobsons bay thank you and thank you very much as well for acknowledging uh the first peoples that 's very much appreciated um we 're obviously living in very difficult times at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a whirlwind so far in 2020. how 's coronavirus and the pandemic affecting you and your family your friends and your community [Music] we are living in the challenging and uncertain times here nearly every country across the globe struggling to reduce the spread of kovac 19 and with the limits of health societal and economic consequences this great impact for us here in victoria the full impact on individual family community work and its intersection is huge and not yet clear so i 'm working in the higher education sector and as same as many universities across the country we are frantically working on strategy to deal with billions of revenue shortfalls from the loss of international students face my daughter she in pharmaceutical industry authored this being a value industry at the current times of coronavirus health crisis but she 's still facing tough challenges to contact her business activity like she has many of clinical trials she needs to do testing but have to be put on hold and because we do with the development of the coral virus rather than others medicine my son is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with job loss so same with my neighbors friends um chose one with young children um especially i saw my neighbor with young children they not fully understand the physical disturbance distancing and self-isolation it 's really tough for them then the organization which i involve or volunteer work with like the cultural group of faith groups the impact in various ways the cancellation of worship services funerals weddings the closure of the sunrise school yet every single member of each household has to adjust his the whole way in order of the life in order to cope and i expect that situation will continue to get worse in 2021 and many many years to come yeah i i 've i 'm aware you 've been spending many many hours uh volunteering your time helping some of our vulnerable community members and different different members of the community so tell me a little bit about but about what you 've been doing and and uh i i i wonder where you find time to sleep but um you 're an incredibly busy person oh i think the part of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and five groups and i think like i said when i received the city of the year uh citizenship of the year award uh volunteer is a part of my life and so i don 't think this does actually extra work and and i just delighted to able to uh able to to do it and um especially with now i focus more in hopsin bay um because i believe in the in few years back when i read through the week health survey that hosted by residents gave their general well-being an average score of 76.6 out of 100 so compared with the victoria is an average of 77.3 which means we are very much satisfied with hosting by where we 're living and so i believe that you know like president and hostile by really really you know like living and focused in the life of the city where they 're living so i wonder you know like the satisfaction that 's in this level that level is still the same during this crisis so i you know like i just like to be maintained do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the the residence of from hopscotch it is it is a challenging time because people 's stress levels are high and uh so there can be sort of more feelings of negativity um and i guess anxiety as well from people and certainly we 're hearing mental health is a significant issue not everyone can can sort of cope or find it easy to manage being sort of uh house bound and not being able to move about as freely as what you have in the past but that 's probably counteracted in some respects by that there 's been a new discovery of our open spaces and our coastline and various parks and walking and shared trails but um maybe you have some insights around your mental health and people 's sort of well-being and um in in in regards to what you were just saying about trying to help create some positivity yeah people i 've talked to many still feeling afraid worried and overwhelmed with this situation but um and especially when people don 't do much physical activity with lack of sleep and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the absence of the healthy destruction unhealthy distraction can cause long-term damage and one of the areas i notice impact most is what i call multi-generational living arrangement rising in the community because and that impact greatly in mental health and well-being some of the household i know of which three generations live together under one roof now and they feel trapped physical and mentally in this arrangement and leading to family breakdowns some families in other hands they love that multi-generation living situation because grandparents can help the the young ones um and um household chore and um helping with financial hardship so yeah yeah so it 's very very different different way at the effect yeah health and well-being yeah no one-size-fits-all yeah now uh something else i 'm aware of the vietnamese association of hobsons bay have been beavering away very quietly in the background making cloth masks i believe in the order of 4 um can you tell me a little bit about that project uh where those cloth are who you 've made them for and um how the idea came about um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly that was just time hopsin bay has had facebook launched calling for all residents and businesses to send the messages that are possibly um uh community spirit something yeah and on the next day i post a short message mention the importance of quiet kindness that can boast the well-being during the lockdown and many of my members while at home have reflected the message and expressed the way how they delivered that kindness and my approach to them was home soul mask and could be an act of kindness and if we can make them and donate them to the community health center community education center art center face group or whatever and if we could do it quietly and that will actually keeping our spirit and the first lot of 1500 masks finished in my are distributed to hofstede by local community center local businesses and local flight groups that another 1500 will make and donated to community group and fight group across western surface and eastern suburb not yet only us then in early june um when my mom 87 years old she living in north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate lockdown it was terrifying for her and for us to when they 're living independently in those facilities they have very little or no assistance with activities of daily living or medical care or nursing care like an aged care center so those have locked down caused so much confusion and fear for them and i 'm here hopelessly don 't know what to do to help them and last week when the council people i think jan and tracy approached me about support how to support the vulnerable groups in hobson bay i can 't think of anything acting out and offer mass making especially for the group the resident and for um floyd uh blush but large nelson has because i i believe they can be you know the same situation at north melbourne public housing and and i when i approach to my members and we know we have to do it immediately because somehow we got the feeling they needed so for two days almost two days last weekend we able to produce another thousand and uh they are now available for free at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that member of the vietnamese association in hobson bay have been offered free to the community center faith group and local resident and i believe that 's just one of the thousand thousand of acts of the kindness we do we i know there 's so many acts of kindness out there and wages a tiny bit and i did i have no words to describe how amazed and grateful i am for the dedication and support from the members um and without them i could not achieve this project and share that generously to the community it 's privileged for me to lead an organization that strong sense of community and good heart yeah yep i just think the work that you guys have done is absolutely incredible uh i didn 't know about the personal background of where that came from so that 's really uh interesting as well i too was horrified when i saw on the news uh what happened with uh north melbourne and flemington so um yeah amazing uh millie i think just just to wrap up um given we are probably short on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or would you have for other people in the community that you would like to share with people the coronavirus outbreak is is changing our lives uh including our relationships with others people in families communities our homes our workplace many of us have lost some or all of our normal ways of seeing others due to social distancing and trying to keep each other safe many of us are being thrown into much closer contact in such a tight very tight environment than usual and that can be very stressful and it may be worrying frightening or even unbearable so many of us um i believe it 's ourselves spending far more time than we used to so um the whole the whole thing just changed and the change changes in our relationship i think is probably the hardest the hardest thing to cope i remember in when i did the business management um course 10 20 years ago according to darwin 's origin of species this is not the most intellectual of species that survive this is not the strongest that survives but the species that survives is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the changing environment so renting on something like that we just have to adjust and adjust to change can be challenging so to me the message out there during this time young or old perhaps worth trying to be extra patient and understanding yeah both of each other and to ourselves maybe create a new routine be flexible when it comes to finding your new routine social distancing does not mean so so disconnecting um develop a new way of communication plan so that can enable us to connect to each other to family and to friends stay informed but not stay alone last but not least i think maybe be gentle and be kind to yourself give yourself a space and time to grief to celebrate and feel every emotion in between so during this challenge time make sure to look after yourself before you look after somebody else and be safe and be well thank you very much very wise words and i 'll be taking on some of that advice myself thank you very much for your time today nearly it 's been much appreciated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the opportunity to listen to this conversation thank you all right bye for now,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you the basics first once you get these basics down pack that you can always advance it afterwards depending on what your fitness needs are first and foremost goal is safety first yet okay make sure you 've got space wherever you 're exercising okay make sure there 's basically you move we 're not going to hit anything lots of space for other people just in case if you 're exercising at home you know anyone to walk through or you 're swinging around when you 're moving weights or you 're doing whatever you 're doing okay safety first the other side of it is make sure that you can handle these exercises all right if you want to advance it by means you can always advance it but just be aware that you need to know one how to do it but then also the aware of what we did it 's our okay you can always build up to it there 's nothing wrong with that alright don 't go healthfully that straight away and go wrong I 'm going to do the absolute advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's just a complete disaster and intuition deters you from doing it again so safety first all right all right guys we 're going to do the first three exercise which will read the leg exercises I 'm going to show you how you can do squats I 'm going to show you how you 're going to do lunges and also going to show you how to do a Romanian deadlift or a stiff legged deadlift okay first of all I 'm going to show first is the squat I 've got the stick here to help myself out in a position if you guys think 'll something like this at home by all means you can use it if you don 't want to you can just simply cross your arms okay and I 'll explain that in a moment how oh why don 't you have your ass crossed first of all what we 're going to do is when you take your stance for a squat position you 're going to have the feet roughly just slightly wider than your shoulders okay not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to narrow in either you 'll find that little happy space you should be able to sort of move your weight back and forth from there I want to make sure the toes are not completely pointed straight out pin straight we 're going to slightly point the toes and we 're going to slightly turn and outwards not complete duck feet it 's not this okay they 're not in words that 's the main thing we want to avoid us pushing in okay so what my feet turn them slightly up and then we 're halfway there I 'm going to take my stick I 'm gonna put up ears or risks across my shoulders okay what on my neck okay we don 't on the neck and we don 't have this far lower okay unless you 're a power lifter we 're not worried about that thing it should be roughly across the shoulder blades okay in a position that 's comfortable all right now just a quick note if you get into this position and you find that your shoulders hurt and you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance you 've got happening on power it 's at the end of the world though might be the best lot to do with the stick so what we 're going to do is that easy method I 've shown before is you cross your arms in front of you but when you do the squat or whatever we do through squats like this on your arms here we want to readies to start with above ourselves okay it 's going look as if I 'm blocking myself off but you 'll like your city what will happen is when we start to do the exercise it 's going to work out better for the shoulders because if I start if I have my shoulders here which is natural you 'll come down you 'll drop forward like this so in theory we teepee now weight forward from here the reason why we have up here as I come down you can see now much better position in my squat and their shoulders are more activated all right now you can 't do that you can always have your arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring your hands out what I want you to slightly lift up your arms and and as you come down cool you can stand up like so come back down again come back so sometimes these are called a Jose now if I 'm using the stick of course my shoulders as you can see with the stick it allows me to be in that position those were mentioned just before what we 're going to do from here is once we have our feet out turned the first thing we 're going to do is with our hips we 're going to start the tilt help so we push up on the back a little bit okay now I complained push this go push back and fall backwards it 's literally a tilt at the hips I 'm going to show you your slide you soon you 're going to tilt it the hips once you do that the team don 't do anything wrong from there imagine you guys sit back so you start to come down as far as you can manage and then you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gonna squeeze your glutes so slide till come down as far as you go back up squeeze the glute when you come up and squeeze don 't squeeze to the point that you push yourself forward alright otherwise you lose in the stability of the woods but also you put pressure through your lower back which is unwanted because that means all the way back here we don 't want that it won 't be strong now this is the side view so you can see the cup until as you can see I 'm sick from there that 's like tilt that 's it then from there you come down that 's why I can go and then we come back up interacting the glue as we said you can use a stick if you want if you want to keep that happening alright know about the other option use is to put this put the weights at the side of your body and some others will do all the different variations of it ok the main thing is although what you do is keep your balance alright so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 're going to do from here is we step forward and that 's the starting position from we 're just going to address what 's on the back from there the back forward side is from this video from the demonstration it 's my left leg alright with my left leg back what I 'm doing for my left heel is I 'm go slightly turning outward slightly so I 'm turning to the left not immensely so don 't be like an old Cindy like like this all right all we want is a very slight our turn the reason for that is it squares the hips out if we keep ourselves in with hopefully you can see you know I 'm very very artsy and wearing all black today you can see my hip now which I used to see he 's pointing this direction now we can still lunch but it 's not ideal and it 's not the most stable position whereas as soon as I turned that hip slightly out or something squared off better then from there as I come down more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see working bed through the motion so the other keys on this red lunch ok it 's done be so far powered that you completely lose balance but also don 't be so closing that your front heel and the front foot raises up again I 'll show you a side view and see with the upper body you can be upright you can slightly lean forward tipping forward so what I mean by that is you can certainly have yourself come as if you 're coming bending the knee but don 't throw yourself forward like this so yeah if I got weight on the side holding my side come down so just drop straight down and I back up if you want to touch the ground with your another knee so they 're coming but make sure you 're stable okay don 't crash your knee down the reason for the company to the ground is a complete dead stop it 's an advanced movement because from there you go keep everything tight again and fought back up really works your glutes on the other leg now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'll show you those later on me do the same thing make sure the heel unit it 's my bar leg now I 'm turning slightly out to the right okay not a lot just a very small amount you might think you 've completely turned you heel out it 's not okay just have back that you 've done the wrong thing from there we drop down we come back up this knee does not lock out to don 't go straight come down back up all right so this is the side view from their left leg up on the heel slightly turned the outside it 's a taut slightly turn to camera for me on everything my legs I thought okay from there I just bend both knees but they suspend coming down back up come down again all right guys next one the legs I 'm gonna show knee stiff-legged deadlift or remaining deadlift or some people call just add image really good exercise it 's the one exercise that I definitely agree with the fuse it 's trained coaches in ways if when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question what 's one exercise that I can do in the gym that 's going to give me the maximum benefit before I can do I 've got about half an hour I would say debit the reason being is just works better overall in terms of functionality great way to build strength works the whole body to compound very good from point of view on fat loss very much one build strength very good on your power right but also that we have a really good functionality towards everyday life yeah the way we 're going to do this one okay is more on the idea that I want you to focus on the stretching of your hamstrings so we 're working on the back of the leg muscle oh okay you may get some stretch residual through the calf area okay particularly you feel like me but at ICAST but generally you should feel the hamstring okay what will happen here is with the stick I may use this as a reference point if you don 't have a stick you can also hold your hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't have any weights holding the stick to your legs okay the stance now is going to be more in line with my shoulder so there the squat we were slightly a little wider gonna be a bit more in okay no this time so no so take my stance I stand upright right sometimes even helps practice the squats which glutes stop the glutes wait for me what you 're going to do is that same detail that we did in our squat that 's slightly dropping in the hip imagine you go up water new hips you just want it that 's all we want to do so if you can envision that in the idea to do that new hips you 're already halfway there so it tilt the hip then what I 'm going to do from here is I push myself believes back that way and it 'll have the rest of my body to tip forward okay coming down with the idea of the bar or the stick stays to my thighs so don 't come in like that no so took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself back back back into I feel stretch you know from here you might find most people or most you 'll get down to just under your knees or just before your knees that 's okay this one is not an exercise that 's going to get you down to the floor all right you get there before you really really flexible or you do a lot of yoga or you also have a indication of possible weakness but that 's something for another day so once I 'm in this position I feel the stretch I return back I simply go back squeeze include back to an upright position we 're not going to push okay and we don 't need to lean back up here okay don 't do that there 's a lot of uija 's of people out there with their dead lifting and what people see is they think that they 've come up with the deadlift and they 've listed three hunky loads and they 're doing this as they come back they 're actually not it 's just that the way that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up or squeeze back it gives you that false image of like they 're in this but they 're not you want everything solid and strong then we repeat till they push back and then from the bottom coming down Steve is close to my leg as possible I come down for me to my knees and then I suddenly return back up squeeze and glutes all right guys I 'll be showing you some of the basic ones okay well the three basic exercises for the intermediates okay well I 'm going to show you how small ways you can advance these movements if that 's what you 're after okay going to do a couple of things where if you are use a resistance band if you don 't have access to actual resistance weights okay any more resistance at home though will still resistance so what I mean by that is like if you got too old to lead our milk cartons or milk containers and you filled them up with water there 's some resistance wipes for you at home you 've got the hands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really want to although I 'm growing probably use them really if you 're wanting to use more of a crib thing because your hands exactly water holding the cans and we 're from a white point of view I personally wouldn 't use it that 's also because like yeah it 's it 's not enough to change all right you 've something that 's going to challenge you the beauty of the milk cartons is you prove water and if you don 't fill it up all the way you can use that slight change about your balance of the water to really work on the grip or as you get strong about you can fill with more fill it up with more water or if your son wants to use them all time you can film with rocks use pepper with whatever okay so but commonly what a lot of interviews is the resistance bands because one it 's easy to grab in use in the very very versatile right I 'm going to show you a couple of ways they can do exercise with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing you but first the other the other ways we can advance is a simple plyometrics now the first thing I want you to know about polite plyometrics is like explosive movement alright so I only do them one if it 's safe for you to do so secondly if you know you can handle it if you know you can handle it because it does elevate the heart rate quite quickly but also make sure you have a good amount of space around you as well plyometrics most of the time you 'll see is mostly associated big jumping and all that kind of stuff alright now if we want to apply metric squat the idea of it is is I want you to think of crouching targeting dragon so what I mean by that is there 's a scene in that film where something is coming towards them and then once they jump up to avoid but then when they land they land with their knees bent they don 't on the government they do this okay they actually physically land so they absorb their landing so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you jump up and catch your landing or you 're doing a froggy on it 's another way of describing it coming all the way down even doing the squat jump catch yourself back again it 's one rep so if we were doing ten repetitions that 's how you do it you can do it continuously if you want but the key thing is to catch yourself don 't be gonna smash and then Java smash and then jump try and absorb your learning as much as you can where I was bad you care two reasons one you certainly get a workout from it okay but the other thing is our hamstrings okay are almost like our brakes or our shock absorbers oh very commonly you 'll see people with injuries in terms of hamstrings but sometimes you 'll think okay it 's got to do with their running and so forth and we are most often it 's either they were beginning to take flight of running or when they go to slow down because they 're going to hit the brakes alright because when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever your run is it 's full fly your hamstrings have to absorb that force of you slowing down alright same with the jump when you come down but land they absorb that alright so you got to make sure that those hammies can handle it if they can 't it 's on the end the world there 's ways that you can explore that except for now I would say to make sure you can do that with a professional trainer or a coach and probably in a better environment than at home because at least you have instant feedback it 's not something that you can just wake up and start doing straightaway yeah the next one to do from that point of view of the advanced movements and plyometrics with lunges is that we set ourselves up in the same way as we were before just going to get seen you sliding the thing and from there what we 're going to do is like we can switch up the jump all right so what we do is we spring up switch it down and land as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so again only attempt this one in this way if you don 't you can okay or you 're any safer bargain so you got plenty of space but also knowing that you can handle it alright I 'll show you some other movements in a moment to advance everything but this is this is one level advancement this is probably like level 3 okay so we come down catch ourselves okay so switch and if you love that okay so that 's one way of advancing it alright in terms of the audio you probably would continue doing that okay because why we want to work on the emphasis of the stretch and the attraction in the blue it 's also pretty good feel all back from the safety point of view I haven 't seen anything myself personally on a bridge that shows explosive movement like this is good for your back I was just not to do something like that always stick to resistance training when it comes to something like hinging and particular when it comes to your back okay want to make sure you protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance both the squad lunch is referred to as one reporter rep or sometimes referred to as a cycle squad what you don 't do it from there if I 'm squatting there my feet stop in the same way from squat when I come down I can do it two ways you can come down back up back down all the way up again that 's one way of doing this on school the other way you say you come down halfway you go back up all the way down and then back up the reason that you 've got those two variations depends on what you want to hammer the most so if I 'm coming down and I go back up and back down again what I 'm emphasizing there is more of the bottom face the actual coming up and back down against that initial start come back up I 'm trying to put more tension in that area because I want to get stronger in that area the other way around I want to get stronger over here in terms of the tension of back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life or motorsport is that if you 've got someone who 's always in that state of ready chances are they want to practice more here tension in the quad area up here knowing that they 've got a lot more strength and stability here but a lot more endurance whereas your bottom face maybe something could be a long jump up because they want to practice the idea of this getting the hamstrings used to stretch in different ways okay you don 't worry about that much your long jump then you should be seen your coach taught me make sure your grip yeah what this will be is or from here you see the band slack and then I 'll stand up as I stand up that 's where the resistance will kick in if I 'm holding a very work so okay so you can come down all the way up and then you introduce the resistance that way that 's one way of doing it same thing for lunch the only difference is that you just sort of give yourself a position we want resistance cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then so there 's one resistance right if you want more give it a little bit of tartness okay as you come down draw it back up alright guys so we 're never gonna do is the show press okay the reason about my knees is just so this is one way of doing at home okay ideally if you can do it as by standing up great alright no the reason I 'm doing any human days is like if you 're in space and you 've got something like a white bar or someone died and you go press up you want to bash the ceiling that 's one thing but you want to make sure you 've got enough room however the other things if you can 't do this standing up that 's fine pop there on your knees the main thing they were saying standing isn 't this is that where you can still protect your glutes okay you can sit down if you want if you want to do that that 's fine however I would suggest to be more upright only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower back a key indication of someone 's upper body strength or the way that they can push about their head is how much they can actually physically press about because it shows how food or strength or stability they have in their lower back you know if you find that you 're auditioning your lower back isn 't the best you want us to do this week on arch and so forth I would suggest bring yourself up to your knees or do it standing up alright now I 'm going to stick for the demonstration the reason I want this angle is because one means those icky points of water I address here but I want you to see where the bar goes or where the steep works in terms of the bar part all right when you take your grip or have you set yourself up is I 'll show you this way first with your stance if you do it standing up just make sure it 's tense don 't be too narrow don 't be too wide just make sure it 's a good stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone 's going to push you over and you had to resist work out with your stances from there to push okay but that generally will give you an indication taking the stick what I want you to do is grip the stick alright thumbs around I don 't see any other thumbs down like like that okay if I find out that you 're doing a shot like that I 'm going to whack you with this stick alright the reason being is if you handle any form of resistance it 's always good to grip the bar with everything including your thumb there 's a reason why we have it and it 's because we need to do things like these a good way to rid of the stable ribbon any bar is instead of gripping from thumb down go from pinky grab from a pinkie first work your way around then the thumb what that does is it brings your wrist as close to the bar or as close to the resistance that you 're pressing or using in a ways that there is much more stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a way sort of chopping up underneath the way so he comes over there you 're gonna choke it out the better or the more purchase you have underneath to come through your arm that there is from a pair of pressing point of view okay in terms of the grip itself so I grabbed from the pinky around both sides then finally the thumb all right when I start what I want to do here is have my wrist roughly in line with my elbow so what I want to happen is from there you know a whaling indicated where you need to be is 10 degree slowly work yourself out sideways very lightly and then once you feel like you haven 't got that need to push anymore probably that 's a good spot for you okay that is too wide and also if you feel you have to do that a shoulder press there 's probably a good chance you 've got that pinching going on as I mentioned before and we don 't mean like this okay doing that we 're just giving a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to find a spot is our short legs in the back glass isn 't straight so straight around that 's fine all right so everyone 's different so I find you a little place okay so now once I 've set up key things I 'm going to do here the reason healing is that way I 'm going to squeeze my glutes again don 't push it forward just squeeze your clothes so now I 'll bring myself in the angle so you can see once I 've set up elbows in line with the wrist I 've got my grip okay I 'm squeezing my glutes I simply started from where druffle my poor babies I press up to the point that I can go no further but I 'm not falling backwards and I 'm not dropping it forward just pressing now as you do this movement you come back down to hollow bone what you want to say any kind of your head to move naturally okay it 's going to go back and forth ever so slightly you don 't need to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going forward and don 't be the other way all right it 's going to naturally do that of course we go too quickly not really of course you need you some of the chin but again it just be one where it 's up bring you back down the collar you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Australia",1679,1884 Melbourne is a growing place the city is expanding rapidly the expanding city needed new stations and in 1886 Lebanon was chosen coming here was my dream when I was really young I heard the name of this country Australia the first time I went to work on the job when I heard a sigh what is your name my name is Giuseppe intern no more Giuseppe from now on you know this job ok we 'll back then back then Lebanon was known as like drugs if you got a lever hi are your into drugs and I 'm not gonna say it 's true but we drove in I said to my daughter on Karen it 's a commission says what 's smile to him now it 's ministry of healing area which she said mum now stop it you waiting to see the unit and and I walked in here and because it was brand new and I looked and I thought I love it and and I still love it just off the freeway as you head west towards what used to be the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those of us who take the exit we find a pocket of Melbourne that 's unique with a diversity of cultural and economic influences that play out across the streets of shopping strips and public spaces well we were first in this walk and then less moved in next door a young woman with a little girl very nice so it 's fairly quiet and blocks of units and made me very happy and it got a bit noisier and as the years went by I come in Australian 1962 it took me one month of each year in cycle 25 dial tone a block plane as I build my house he was the dream of my life I 'm ambling at night and I live at Wood Street which is the street where is now slowly over time a lot of the businesses it closed down so for about probably 15 years it was a pretty quiet day when I was an awesome dog they operated on and go away you 're walking into Austin says oh we 've got a year we go to you I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should drive past year before they put the big barriers up along the freeway and always remember ting no never I 'm Justin Timlin I was born in 1982 and when I first came to Levin I was halfway through great prep there was a lot a lot of stoned people a lot of a lot of boys trying to be tough yeah it wasn 't it wasn 't it wasn 't a nice gentle place first time I came back on me the 500 in my pocket I couldn 't speak English I was in a like in another Southern College Station I didn 't know how to buy ticket and this a guy he helped me to buy a ticket on for my own money and I still remember that that incidentally is always in my mind and up to now I have ground I saved 10 people when someone I see in that situation I remember my time and I buy ticket for them they say it because someone bought it for me you know I think that that 's why I can sort of say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I built the Royal Sky ring I started 1964 and he was like a meeting place and this meeting practically had a lot of job they created a Laura smile a lot of friendship the whole immigration profile that 's come to Melbourne I think has been reflected from the 70s 80s 90s in our community as well over the last four or five years Levin and generally I think has had an increase in multicultural families moving to the area they 've bought their grocery shops and restaurants uns and things into the block all the suburbs become here for their services so I feel proud sometime that yeah they know me know who is me know she got a beauty salon hair salon in Levitan but definitely if you are going to any country you need a lot of guidance if you want to settle there if you don 't want to waste your time and your family 's time so the people Marty are pretty friendly and safe it 's slowly improving rabbiting I 've been here for now Nymeria proximately 9e his business is fantastic I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you know you talk with people every day and it 's sort of allowed interacting with people I 'm people person and it 's Joe when I wake up like Iraq a photo clock in the morning and it doesn 't really I don 't really feel like I 'm going for work it 's sort of I feel like I 'm going for party like so much of Melbourne it 's an area that 's transforming new developments and the beginnings of so-called gentrification sit alongside abandoned shops and empty blocks Nash mash is it 's a lot of things it 's a screen printing program it 's also a collective of young creative people in their local area we run guest workshops with local artists and young people come in and they learn how to spin prints and we make merchandise we make t-shirts I 'm councillor Sandra Wilson currently the mayor of Hobson 's Bay so to have this wonderful shop front in Wood Street is is just fantastic and it 's really activating a lovely part of Levitan close to public transport and a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formal evident post office into a vibrant art space and a base for a number of cultural and community groups hi I 'm sandy from the Wood Street garden space you know we have a lot of people that are quite interested they 're not really Lucilius yeah but they won 't know what we do here so they 're open at the laundromat and I 'll just walk up a stream ago yeah what are you doing yeah what 's going on can we run a workshop program here as well as an other activities but I 'm the foundation of the Art Center is the workshop program so we have like drawing or we had pottery we had those fantastic free art classes for kids called outsource on a Saturday morning we 're getting a lot more people from just from the street looking to us coming in engage in the in programs here so it 's been bad yeah I met Glenn when I did the person art exhibition here and invite him to exhibit because I thought his work was fantastic and through that then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know obviously met his mum and she 's gorgeous like your name real me mum and he 's a top way everybody loves her yeah I 've got no patience at all none at all but when it comes to drawing or painting I 've got all the patience in the world no man so I just keep drawing we paint and these people here that have helped me out a bit because they 've sold a few join [Music] we 're here at the limits of both parties [Music] with the far more advanced potential advice here at the Roasterie athlete oh and it 's just a it 's just a great space that we could come together and share [Music] the community keeps getting bigger every time we come back it is really exciting to see this is the biggest event or even not as good for us also to see the other artists that use the spaces now I love the fact that it is multicultural I like the option times sake that 's probably about the most profitable visitors it 's just got a good feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the same space the same kind of physical space yeah I think that is probably the only thing that 's going to help us realize that our fear is not with other people but [Music] find something else to fear I don 't judge people whoever they are so if someone said I I would like this is this area a bit of miss a bit of drug-addicted thank you I 'm friends with them do and I 'm friend with the police too so friends with everyone it 's improved so much from the the name that it had previously in the past it 's been a little bit of a backwater Levitan house is becoming quite popular and a lot of people are coming here and it 's really great I just love living here to be able to see what we 've achieved in in the few years that we 've been going together it 's really great there 's a country giving me the joy to have a secure job they give me the joy to make more friends and

Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",3300,hi everybody again it 's me Cara exercise physiologist and today is our very last video so we 're going to recap and do the things that we have learned over the last few weeks if you 'd like to learn more make sure you click on the videos movement in isolation and we cover the topics a little bit more so whatever you like that exercise is great in a nutshell many benefits of exercise including management of some chronic health conditions such as cancer type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease and this goes on other benefits include improving our sleep stress management and always like I 've said it and making us feel good so overall exercise is superb and beneficial we then talked about how we can hand this into our day so lots of different types of ways we can exercise first one is aerobic exercise now that 's where we spoke about adding in some walking or some vibrating awesome swimming things that use our big muscle groups and that we can easily add into our day what we can do is start with 10 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you slowly progressed down the goal for that one is roughly around half an hour a day so get walking we then spoke about our strength exercises and the importance of adding strength training into our week so that can include just some home exercises using our body weight it can include using some weights it might be something that you enjoy like going to the gym or going to a group bus lots of different things we can do strength training but really really beneficial to keep our muscles strong and getting help with managing chronic conditions as well as keeping our joints and everything like that happy next thing we covered was stretching which is really really important for a mobility again about joints and keeping us mobile to allow us to do activities and everything doing home putting in our socks putting on a jacket all that stuff 's made a lot easier if we do some regular stretching another topic we covered was balance training so exercises we can add any from falls prevention preventing Falls is a big big theme so we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well and we also spoke about reducing to the entry time so maybe saw that if we do have a prolonged set of time or from line down whatever we might be doing throughout our day so we make sure that we break up our day which stretches or walking and yeah so all in all what I want you to guys to get most out of our weekly chats is that any movement is good movement so please pick something you enjoying whether it 's dancing around room walking with a friend doing it strength training you enjoy whatever is please just make sure it 's something you enjoy and that will make it so much easier to add into your week also being consistent is really really important so I always say to everyone pick two days a week those two days you must do something anything after that is a bonus so do your strength training your balance exercises on like a Monday food is going great tick them off and if I 'm sailor you feeling good you want to do something extra even better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some movement anytime you can through any day and I can guarantee you 'll start to feel better and in general there 's just sorry so many benefits alright so today what we 're going to do is a combined exercise program so we do a little bit over to aerobic warm-up will then do some strength exercises some balance exercises and then end off with some stretching so there 's everything we were spoken about combined if you need to throughout please make sure you take your rest and again only do exercises that you feel safe to do so and you can always just have a look and see how you go if you do have a new health condition you have an exercise before or you just unsure please make sure you speak to your GP or a trusted allied health professional before you complete your exercises today just give it a go and as I said anywhere is good movement so let 's get ready all right guys today we 're serving with anaerobic warm-up so we 're just gonna start with getting the body moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a little rest and get into our strength exercises so first what I 'd like your stomach is marching on the spot you can again put on to shape if you need to hold on to the back of the chair hold on to the sides here with one hand or no means whatever you now feel comfortable with so I 'm going to start with doing here today and I walk in the spot today we 're going to up it and we 're going to 30 seconds look at the clock a beyon seems really good get some renovation for your trunk and again get the shoulders moving which we need to do so let 's get matching thirty Seconds does feel like a long time can challenge really to me today so once we get to the 30 seconds have a little great up if you need to have a rest anytime like I said please take your rest but I 'm just going to keep moving through it again if you need to always pause the video have a greener and then keep going today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast feet so up down up down up down up down if you need to hold on to the chair just small movements lift up up down up down up down and again arms easy major rest at any time make sure you take your reps small feet fancy and rest have a breather all right and next one is our sidestepping so I 'm gonna take your big step forward just because there 's a chair there big step up up bring the feet together apart together okay and then all the way back you can think a little bit quicker if you need to see how you go the main thing is we 're going to get our hips moving and our legs nice and warm again if you have super coordinated sometimes I 'm not yeah Josie if you 've got a nice long hallway you can do a few steps otherwise no arms step across step across a little bit more and then rest okay have a breather if you feel like that 's not too challenging for you you can repeat those again so pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast feet and do side to begin that 's absolutely fine otherwise we 're never going to get into some strength exercises alright our first exercise is at a seat Tuesday and so a Bhangra variation in a few weeks so today I 'm just going to start with the C stand and I 'm going to give you a weighted option today just to make it that little bit harder for those who need it so feet flat on the floor arms across the chest standing up and sitting down we 're going through ten let 's go that 's two eight no I and ten have a rest down always rest about 20 to 30 seconds in between your exercises have a great life and you do your next round much much better than if you just keep coming through and really really beneficial for the muscles if we do that so and the second round we 're going to do some weights so if you 've got any weights at home I 've got one Gilad one or twos it 's also fine you can hold both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them at your chest okay as we were saying to and lower into a squat so I 'm gonna put my weight together and I 've actually got them on my chest and they 're resting on my chest I 'm then gonna push through my heels stand up tall and then sit down okay so you pick your option let 's get going now you can have arms on the side you can use the handles on the chair tell them across your chest or now you can start to add weight to do ten to and ten are done have a rest okay and next one is our wall pushup I do explain these enough strength training video so we will go through it now again I do have to face away from the camera but main point up arms out nice and straight start with about half a meter away from the wall and you 're aiming to bring your nose towards the wall and then ad against you want to really focus on bending your arms keep your body nice and straight and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms reach taller might be their way I 've been my elbows no to the wall and then I come out again and my body is staying nice and straight we 're going to you ten ten again have a Rex putting 30 seconds if you found that was too challenging you can step closer to the wall and give it a go or if you found that a little bit easy your next progression up would be using your kitchen bench as long as you feel safe again and have your hands on the kitchen bench and just making sure again that your buddy is nice and flat and you 're not doing it too bent over okay so say it 's going to use the wall a little extra challenge if you go further back onto your tippy toes and in your aim and app let 's do dogs in say nice and straight you know so lots of ten of your more push-ups next one is our car phrase cheer next to you if you need it coming up on two tires and then down again on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do ten 10 have a rest also receipt adoption if you 're unable to stand safely have a sit down the chair and again lift your heels off without blue arrest when you 're home make sure that wrist is 30 seconds then we go again make a chair use it up and then Danny you want challenge no games and again your speed that you are comfortable with but then all right thought it 's time to grab your weights to the next one so water boils cancer through whatever you 've got I 've got the one kilos today just try and stay light if you have these weights before we 're going to start some bicep curls so hands by your side lifting the weights up to you shoulders and then down again having a nice wide base of support with your feet for balance we 've got ten eight nine ten have you rest you do get every stain you can 't pull them to the other way that 's also fine so you pick whichever is comfortable for you today I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten two more nine ten bicep kiddo well done alright well we have the weights are going to do a shoulder press again are these if you feel comfort with your shoulders and you can also do this for that way to start with but today we 're into it so your knee right up to the roof and then back down let 's go ten breathe that as you go up breathe in breathe out breathe I 'm all ten probably the brave up bring the weights down if you need to shake it up check it out again you see what way you 've got solid something light and then just see how you feel after today all right you 're doing everything together so let 's go again next ten breathe out breathe in again you can hold the weights different ways you can hold them out that way just use different muscles three months nine ten well done that one is your shoulder press falling from up strength exercises we 're now going to do some balance so to start we can go and stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a chair next to you just for support and we 're going to aim stand on one leg for thirty seconds let 's go ten more seconds if you do need to hold on and reset please do that is absolutely fine and then you can check it out and start again if you need to swap sides so they do have our necks to the side that you 're standing on just for safety but again lifting that leg half the chair nearby so we know 30 seconds I don 't want you to put your foot down or up or your right touch that 's going if you haven 't started already if you do touch that 's fine I want you to start again and use that whole 30 seconds to keep touching and keep standing and just putting that weight through that leg try your best for that whole 30 seconds and you will start to improve you might touch the chair list or you might have ten seconds of a good one start again and keep going about ten seconds to go and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise is tandem walking or better known as heel toe walking and this is another one before our balance so always see this one next to a wall or in your hallway where if you do is balanced you do have something to hold on to so we stand next to the wall and we 're going to walk heel toe as if you 're going to tightrope in a circus I am your best the triangle of your head if you can that can be tricky and then we turn around and go back and just make sure the whole set if you need it if you 'd always hold on okay yeah October the challenge is to move ahead it 's hot a little loose we 're going to do another lap up and back around and making sure heel-toe heel-toe okay that contact me make it a little bit harder that 's another balance exercise for you I got something a show we 're going to do a few stretches so we 've done aerobic warmup we 've done some strength exercises and we 've done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we 've done the last few weeks is our ankle circles so within the feet are five one way the other stop just to be able to be for the joint so this is where I like to move the joints make sure they 're nice and mobile five one way and again as slow as your nature you 're also fine the next one would trash all it is is shoulder rolls so let 's get the shoulders moving you again can do them as big as you like or as small as you like you might do some creeks and creeks that 's fine we 're just moving those muscles good next like a shave their shoulders out and when you started trying to bring out each about shoulder just something last little stretch just go to way you can do that running down it slowly looking up the other side nice and slow good job okay standing up we 're going just move the hips make sure I keeps a nice and mobile this one for me is a favorite just nice and easy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the hip joint if you want to add in your circles it 's going to be a little bit tricky for some people but you see how you go that 's absolutely fine [Music] one for the knees really good is your bottom keep up now again I 'm going to do them where you can some people might be a little one others might do a nasty one keep moving good and then the last time history went through enough stretching program he 's out hamstring stretch so sitting on the edge of your chair put forward with your toes on the roof and then place your hand come to you by sliding roll down when you feel it stretch your stop remember don 't be pain feel that stretch have eight legs I don 't like guard that strike ties to the roof and you thought down and then last one which is allowed to Eddie in just food for our shoulders as well and just to get some breathing making sure we are cooling down is coming up overhead breathe in and then breathe air now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder movements so if you can come to here and that 's as far as you can go also fine so you breathe in breathe out if you 're kidding you 're high up go higher breathe in breathe that deep breath and breathe well done everybody you have just completed a full body exercise program so you started with your aerobic warmup we did our strength exercises where we added some weights in we did our balance exercises and then we finished off with our stretching so a full body program that you completed at home hopefully you 're feeling good and you realize that it is something that you can add into your week I mean if you can to do this twice a week and then any extra is a bonus I do recommend having a rest day so try and do them two days in a row have a break and then do it the day after and again adding in any movement that you can throughout the day so that 10 minute walk that 20 minute bike ride whatever you can fit in any movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for watching it has been a pleasure if you do want any extra information I think I spoke about today have a look at the other videos and I

Civic Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",1438,I came to Australia in 2006 so this is way back way back a couple years ago before that I lived in refugee camp this was in refugee can call Kakuma in Kenya so my parents escaped to a war in South Sudan and they travel all the way to Kenya usually by food maggiore them traveled by food then their fan of Salam 's at the refugee camp the refugee camp was actually very interesting because the lifestyle there was what we used to everything was quite as quite normal everything that 's just normalized because there was it wasn 't that much expectation on what 's on the outside world it 's just like one of those philosophy where if you exist within the box the whole thing you know is what 's in the box so wherever does outside of the box you won 't be able to really question that of had the desire to escape the box so I was basically satisfied and this is probably based on the fact that I was I was young as well so my life expectation went has you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get older so life was basically simple then and then finally week we came to Australia that was in 2006 at that time I was I was just amazed by everything where everything was so new there 's so much lights in particular the the airport the airport is just amazing it 's just it 's crazy you know I was like where was this part of the world you know of it I had I had never seen anything like it I never seen so much buildings never seen so much shiny stuff you know got to a point where some time I hurts my eye because I was used to the dock when I was in refugee camp we had no we had no electricity so there was too much light there was so much brightness too bright but I was just super excited you know it 's just so happy and there was so much nice people too you know there was a lot of incredible people Clowry was one of them as well he 's a godfather he 's a friend of mine a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old person 's very nice person as well a religious person so how full as well he 's the one that actually helped our family come to Australia he helped pave the way for a family to to pay for the ticket and so on and obviously he 's not he 's not South Sudanese not African and so on like he 's Australian but it was just incredible that somebody out there that is a stranger I 've never met before never heard of them have no idea about me that I exist but they just think that you know I think we can just help them so it was just so much it 's always a kind of overwhelming to come to a new area where everything is just so new I think the term refugee to me to me I think it means the fact that there 's certain human beings out there who who have haven 't been given that basic lifestyle or the life the living standard that is sufficient or the right standard that people need to sufficiently live a healthy life so has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe the other side of the world have for example shelter you know and resources such as food support as well and and usually a lot of refugees there there 's always an issue with the the country that they lived in like the original place that they started from there 's always some sort of political issue or or something that 's that 's thus given that huge disadvantage in life for them to really like like at least chase their dreams or at least we leave at least be free at least be a free person without having to constantly worry about all these needs of life and and and not die of course them there 's a huge misconception about what does it mean to be a refugee I 'll give you I 'll give you an example a refugee I 'm just a this is just an assumption someone out them I think someone who 's refugee is somebody would need saving somebody who just needs to be given everything we spent food because their struggle like they they 've been through the hardest life so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free days free days so when people will look at refugees like that they start to to not understand that these people are human beings they were working hard before life circumstances hit them there were human beings like everybody else there was just there they 're hard workers there they had do do possess some sort of intellectual ability whether even if they don 't speak the language that is the standard their stool they still are very intelligent you know they can communicate the conform ideas and they can participate in the workforce there so there 's a huge misconception about what does it mean to be a refugee a lot of people believe that these people are just getting saved for no reason and they have not contributed back to humanity or they don 't deserve it and that is a that is an issue or the fact that there 's other misconception such as these people have suffered so much and they 've gone through so much trauma so therefore who knows there might be psychological have been affected which could affect the way they live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to function within our society will they be able to know that you should not still you not you should not do this you should not do this it should not do this oil she speak at this certain way so every refugee is unique in his own way because of where the environment they came to including the experience they 're gonna go they 're gonna go through a refugee camp just allowed allowed me to really express my creativity and I think that 's where my creativity initially started from I was able to create something out of absolutely nothing or out of something that 's not the ordinary way of creating that thing King Jack well I 'll start with Jack so Jake is my full name my initials so John a you guy so that 's Jack and King was just I just try to think of core something cool you know and then my bed was like oh come on you know just this is good King you know I 'm like yeah I 'll start king and yeah this became King Jack so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I started the brand name all I had to do was just create a Facebook account and King Jack Creighton you know and just start pulling stuff and people started perceiving as King Jack you know and I started seeing their attraction so music became one of our biggest passion I still do consider myself as as a refugee if somebody labels me as a refugee I don 't see that as an offence I 'm not offended by that in fact I would also appreciate the fact that that person at least has tried to label me or categorize me to certain certain group at least you know so I wouldn 't really I wouldn 't be offended all the refugees are there the best thing to I would just tell them if I see one of them is just be patient you know patient is everything it took us about five years before we were accepted to come to Australia and that was very tough all the refugees out there though looking for they 're not looking for Savior they 're just looking for a new location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the hut down get a house you know cook some food that 's all the one they want the basic stuff so guess be patient have faith that 's what I would tell them have faith you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",3176,hi guys my name is Caroline I am the exercise physiologist working with hostas Bay and today we 're talking about reducing us an extra time now what that means is reducing prolonged sitting or lying down and trying to increase your overall activity throughout the day and we 'll talk to you some tips on how you can best do that so it 's really important that we do reduce this there are studies that show prolonged seating and prolonged length such as the dentary time is associated with poorer health status so if that makes it really really important that we do break up a day as much as we possibly can there 's lots of ways we can do this at home so I 'll just go through a few just make sure that when you do these at home that you feel safe and confident to do so if you have any concerns please don 't hesitate just don 't complete the examples so first thing which I think is the easiest is getting up throughout your day so brighten up your day and making sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in between you do some movement this is really good if you 've studying we 've got some hobbies such as sewing something that is a prolonged activity making sure that you set your time and you get up have a break go through the walk or do some activity and then you can start again okay so little things we can do also to break up our day include walking around the house so doing some laps around the house making sure we use the stairs other ones can be using the toilet furthest away so if you 're in a certain room and the toilets nearby just taking an extra 10 to 20 steps use the furthest away will just increase your step count and just help you drink it up in a bit more other ones convey d when you 're on the phone welcome your and while you 're on the phone so rather than sitting down on the couch having a chat tomorrow or a family member papí earphones in or grab the phone and walk around the house that will also increase your daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a walk around the block you 'll be so surprised how quick the time goes while you chatting and you 'll get some daily exercise in as well other ideas adds a lunch outside or in a different room so if you finally are having a prolonged activity such as sitting at your desk or you 're doing a project just by simply making your lunch and sitting in a different room will increase your activity as well rather than sitting back at the same spot and just completing activity if you are working from home or studying at home which all of us in this time are make sure that you do take stretch breaks throughout the day a little micro break so little five-minute breaks have a little stretch get up and move and this can really help to improve your concentration and decision making as well which is really important to help us keep switched on so just making sure that you do little things same thing if you 're on the phone or you 're in a meeting put the phone on that speaker have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in or if you are able to take that meeting or phone call and you feel like you don 't need to maybe take notes or something papi earphones in and again try your best to go for a walk if you do have your family at home too so all of us are homeschooling at the moment trying best use that time to get out door with the kids when you can so if they have their red purse brave and that might work with you your cool let 's get outside and throw the ball or kick the soccer ball or maybe walk so really important that we use our time wisely and we do there 's a little break from the day it doesn 't mean we have to find time for a half an hour or a ten minute walk which I 'm still highly highly encouraging but dates more about okay we have got things to do that we know we 're we seated for a long time like studying or might be a hobby that 's great but we need to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending all day sitting or all day laying down because it does lead to poor health um so just try your best to move throughout the day get up sit down do some stretches again whatever makes you feel good and yeah just try to break up your day as much as you can okay guys for today we are going to warm up with marching on the spot so again if you need to please use this chair to assist and holding on with one hand or if you do also your pot on with two hands today I 'm coming on with one sitting next to the chair and might shoot on the spot if you feel able let 's get the arms moving as well so bring your legs as high as you feel comfortable some people might go nice high and others might go nice and low so whatever makes you feel good we are just wanting to warm up today so let 's get moving ten more five six seven eight nine ten well done my favorite exercise is now a sit to stand so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the variations again just in case you 've forgotten or maybe didn 't see the year one so first variation is if you do have handles on your chair to place your hands on the handles and use your upper body support to help you get up so you push on the handles Utena legs as well and then standing use your handles again and then sitting down okay in the second variation which you can choose from is having your hands on the bottom of your check so if your chair doesn 't have handles holding onto the bottom of the chair and again helping with the upper body so usually I 'm body support putting three legs and then standing up and then sitting down our aim is as we get stronger that we will reduce our body support and we 'll just use our knife strong legs okay so our third variation is feet flat on the ground arms across our chest pushing through our legs standing up nice and tall and then sitting down okay maybe hands wherever you live if you have them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my I feel like it 's easy and they 've got a place to go okay so let 's start with five reps starting down three four and five take a rest well done make sure to rest 30 seconds to a minute in between each round of exercises today we 'll be doing three lots of five sets of stands okay a really important exercise and the reason I love it it 's because we use it day to day we need to sit to stand we 've got to get out of the car get off the toilets get out of the kitchen chair and even little things like when we go to a restaurant or a cafe and the chairs are different then I would use our leg streets we got to get up he 's really really important okay so sticking around choose your variation where your hands going to go but sky 5 making sure you stand as tall as you can one more and five very good sitting down now if you are finding this little bit tricky you can also sit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit easier to be able to get up okay so sitting on the edge of the chair a little bit more and putting your torso forward will help weave rocking up and in there there can be a first variation to when you reduced using your upper body but please do whatever you feel comfortable so I 'm gonna sit back on my chair have my feet foot on the ground ready through my last lot and go pushing through my heel stand up tall two more four and five good job have a little breather all right our next exercise in the standing calf raise so again if you have a nice sturdy chair you can hold on with both hands for support second level is holding on with one yet and third level is no hands so just see where you go I 'll do a side on today just so you can see what I 'd like you to do is stand up as tall as you can putting your weight three toes and lifting your heels up and then down okay I 've got one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll say one one one one and two more I can feel my calves already and rest okay again 30 seconds rest is ideal so if you are comfortable at home do do it behind a chair you just can 't see what I 'm doing your home saying behind the chair today so that 's why I 'm standing side on however if you 're feeling like you 're challenged you can always get insight on what 's that means we 're going to use one hand or you might use them okay so start again for a second around let 's go you 're coming up and down good job five more you 're soon to around the ten today I can feel it eight nine and ten well done and the next exercise is seated and this is a standard leg raise which is really really good for out though I must say increasing our strength in our legs so what we 're going to do is sit in our chair sitting nice and tall using the back and simply lifting our leg up straight ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down okay to start we will do opposite leg one two three and down let 's go trying your best to hold for three seconds each Rick I mean up squeeze one two three damn coming up one two three very good now just go as high as you can some people might not be out extending their legs strike that 's absolutely fine so you might be I just get to here that 's absolutely fine do what you can as long as we get the legs moving I am happy and rest okay so you will feel it through here you might put in your knees a little bit and that 's just she 's majoring moving okay once we need to be able to really helps with our movement and our walking so you do feel it could just be their legs along yeah okay so let 's go again coming up squeeze two three relax outside two three yeah good making sure that you do use the back support okay good all we want to isolate is making sure that we do use our legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up okay so just isolating the leg that 's why we do you have our back on the chair all one two three other side we should family to be nice and warmed up and rest all right and this exercise is sidestepping now this is something we can use to break up the day and something we can easily do at home okay so eating away in the lounge room if you are easy on your feet however please use a bench to assist you so use your kitchen bench have your hands on the bench or your fingertips on the bench to help you do this okay what I want you to do is stand up I 'm going to start with our feet together feet open feet together feet open feet together we 're gonna keep going more and then back so just getting nice and tall hands by your side and we 're just saying your strengthen up our hips and moving a different movement okay you have a breathe I need to shake it out shake it out you stand tall feet apart feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different so some people might take big steps some people might take small steps you just do whatever feels comfortable so whatever feels good try to go to the start just a hip width and then together hip width together just stop that I want to do a few laps you get into your groove and you 'll start of knowing what feels good for you alright so that is our side stepping all right now next one is our seated heel and toe raise okay so if you can do any time even when you are seated if you are doing your hobby or your are working what I 'd like to do is lift your toes up guys think about black shoes and lift your heels okay so we 've seen your toe is a really important exercise and this can prevent things such as tripping because you are able to lift your toes off the ground okay there 's almost scuffing on the floor so really really good to work these muscles down here see me do tires first pop it back down the ground lift your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get your legs going and get some blood flow into our feet and into our ankles which is also really really beneficial 3 whole 2 3 well done now if you do have trouble lifting your toes at the front you can always try one leg at a time so you can just stop your toes and just start with one leg at a time and leave the heel raises for later on when your understanding it is really good to get these toes up so if you do have trouble trimester like I said one at a time or both have a look you might have one foot better than the other so it might be good to practice okay so tie lift heel lift title if here lift good job toilet healing again you can do these slower than me that 's absolutely fine you do what feels good you two more so lift your left toe with a lift good job okay our next exercise we give us moving a bit more is our seated front punches okay so again sitting nice and comfortably in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher it up a bit so starting with your hands in a fist okay if you can and your hands up to your chest and you 're going to punch forward 20 times seven eight nine ten keep going 17 18 19 20 well done well a short rest this time because then we 're going to go above now for a few people this might be a hard movement we might have sometimes through our shoulders we might not do a lot overhead so if you feel that comes wrong please go back to your front punches or if you feel like you 're unable to go and completely up just a little ones and what that will do is increase that range of motion and increase that blood flow in your shoulders which is going to be really good for us okay if you do have any shoulder conditions though obviously don 't do these exercise unless they prescribed by a health professional okay so let 's go up above our head one arm at a time ten more awesome have a rest and then we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders and you feel a bit puffy maybe because you 're working hard and you 're getting it heart rate up that 's really really good okay again take that rest have some breaths and we 'll start again let 's go I was up front punches now you can do this in Sami if you 'd like but today I 'm just gonna add some seated exercises in first but I was counting that was 10 17 18 19 20 okay a little rest get ready we 're going to go above again if you don 't feel comfortable you go back to your front hunches again okay let 's go single on 10 whole well done and just to finish off with some mobility let 's go back to last week with our ankle circles bring that leg up five one way and then sweet this is the tricky part five the elbow and then swap other leg one way two kids I might be small so might be big see how you go now if you have trouble lifting your leg and holding up that 's fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while your heel is on the floor okay and then go back the other way and then other foot start here on the floor I mean it could be a good option to start with if you 're not sure then if you 're feeling good you can bring your leg up and my favorite weight if you need is with some shoulder rolls up back and down okay you need be use your lat or as small as you like again if you are getting too long periods it 's such a nice one to relax these muscles in their neck your neck shoulders and really helps to reset our posture so good one you can add in throughout your day three two one good job any other stretches that you do feel like through the mouth as long as you are safe to do so and you 're done before and being instructed by a professional uses two minutes to do some breathing like I said and some stretches and how aggressive the day,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Civic Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",1711,well it was a long journey coming to Australia definitely so I was born in congo democratic republic and so from Congo after the civil war started after the 23rd civil war I think we went from Congo Central Africa went to Uganda Nigeria and they went down to the coast interns Ania I went down to Malawi and then we lived in Malawi for five years I believe and then Australian Immigration Department accepted our claim as refugees and we came here to Australia living in Malawi was was a trip really because you don 't realize that you know you are in that sort of situation because everyone that you see is in that sort of situation you know the idea of a class structure doesn 't really exist because everyone that you see anywhere you walk is is in the same boat as you really so coming here and seeing that different levels of you know working-class middle-class and upper-class was quite confronting for me because I didn 't really I just saw everyone as equal living refugee camp so that experience there was was deep because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't easy because you could 've been caught up in all the violence and crime so people who do make it out of the refugee camp are very very lucky I feel like really any word can have a positive or negative connotation with it so the term refugee for me used to being something something deep you know something welcoming because when I was living refugee camp you know everyone was refugee and you 'd walk down the road and it 'll know you as you know you 're this sons you got you this son Selena Charla something like that you know but I feel like lately the word refugee has had a very negative connotation with it you know using derogatory ways and with derogatory terms and it has become a sort of stigma to be called a refugee so you know I feel like the idea of refugee as a person you know has really changed and I feel like a lot of people we miss the fact that when you 're talking about refugees you 're talking about real people you know actually human beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of moved away from that and just focusing on the numbers so yeah when I came to Australia it was it was very confronting it was very very confronting because firstly I had never seen stop sign before I have never seen like traffic lights like that was huge for me I nearly died on the road a couple times definitely taking a bus public transportation the train home I 've never been trained in my life and the train was just it was like you know you know it 's a welder 's it 's like a spiritual experience for someone for a person for a kid who has never been on that type of situation it was something that you experienced really really really deeply yeah I 'm English like the language barrier I was huge for me because I never spoke English in my life you know so having to learn a whole new language you know it was quite hard was quite hard and I also just just understanding in general because not many people have experienced life like refugees you know like imagine where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think just imagine there 's a war out what just happens I don 't know where you know this that 's fighting civil wars and all that and then you 're told that you have to leave your home all right your family you know my grandma I miss my grandma so much but you realize right but once once you imagine that why once you imagine really have to having to leave your home why I live just in Altona north but just imagine having to pack up one day no tech tech nothing really all right just a couple of photos and then leave your home all right and then go into a place or a different country where you know you 're treated as you know some second-class you know in accepted as who you are and there 's all this stigma and misconceptions of you know why you 're there it can be quite trunk challenging you know for a person quite confronting and that 's why I say like you know the the biggest help you can get really isn 't the physical stuff you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can always get new beds and new TVs but it 's the emotional stuff you know the motion requirement just being there for someone I feel like that 's very very important I think the the biggest part for me in terms of how I was working was having friendships I feel like you know a lot of refugees have a lot of physical needs of course you know they don 't really have anything when they come here but I feel like the most important thing that they need is the mental aspect as well you know when you come into a new country you know you don 't want to be alone you know that feeling is it sad really so having you know different friends come out to me you know different families come in and and talk to us and and help us out and stuff like that that was really really important and and my family my mom has always been a religious person so going to church in the church welcoming us what was really important I remember I became an altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I became an altar server there once I started primary school and just the idea that you 're part of a community you know you 're part of something bigger than just yourself I feel like it 's really important because that that 's what unites people you know when you can when you can do something that is beyond just your for your own self-interest and and now that I think about it I feel like being a an altar server was sort of like a way of me saying thank you for the Welcome that I received you know I remember getting my first watch from the from the parish that was incredible that was really really good and I don 't know it just sounds like such an easy thing I said you got a word from savers you know but I had never really earned anything of my own you know so just receiving that for me that was really deep I think I still have it actually at home because it reminds you of you know that even even as people when you know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know who you are or why you are here deep down I feel like everyone has goodness in them and and and to have that watch reminds me that you know at the bottom of every person right there is true light this brilliance you know that is unique and that 's why my passion I think also is about people because if that word for me represents something represents what I I 'm working towards as well you know one day I want to be also able to give a watch to someone who who comes from a refugee camp yeah currently I have finished year 12 the hardest year of any student I think and I 'm going to Mobile University now doing a double major in politics in international relations and sociology I am very passionate about and something that I never thought I was but I 'm very passionate about people like like seeing other people grow and develop I love motivating people I feel like as people as humans you sort of get I feel like that 's when you find your true happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know lifting the burdens of other people remember this quote by Charles Dickens he said you know no one suffers who lightens the burdens of others and I feel like that 's so important when you 're able to help other people so I feel like I 'm very very passionate about people and I think something I 'll continue to do for as long as I live here I definitely still defined myself as a refugee a hundred percent because it 's it 's it 's made who it 's made me who I am you know it 's part of my identity it 's part of the person I 've become you get to think you know so I 'll be sitting there and doing the essays you 'll be like I like Augustin remember you know where you used to be and think about where you are now and and just that thought you know really inspires me and I noticed for some people might be like you know it doesn 't really make sense why like for me that 's that 's deep because it shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human being so being refugee a hunter sent it is part of me yeah what I would like to say to other refugees is that to remember your light it 's very important I feel like as people were born everyone is born with the light and and your brilliance is your light it is uniquely yours alright that 's that 's something that you can 't be taken away from you is uniquely yours and you 're here as as people as human beings on this planet to express the brilliance that is uniquely you and you 're here yeah as a person to be powerful beyond measure you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",5685,hi everyone i 'm back uh you might notice that i 'm sitting down this time what i 'm going to do today is we 're going to do a little bit of mobility just to coincide with cars stretching all right the good thing i like about mobility is uh it 's very good to do either before a workout or if you want you can do a little bit after workout although ideally before uh also the other good thing about it is it can be done on other days so you don 't necessarily have to do it on a workout day it can range from doing little things with just let 's say for example just your feet specifically or you can do a whole heap of stuff so we can like today we 're going to do a bit more of a whole body taste introduction today uh later on i want to do some more specific ones so like a real good lower body one and an upper body one okay so we 'll get into that now now with the tail one what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to physically almost pretend like we 're being a monkey so we 're going to pop the tail on the ground like so now i 'm just going to do it with the one foot now see how we go on this because i haven 't tested on this surface but ideally what you want to do is imagine that you 're trying to roll up or scrunch up or pull that tail up using your toes same way as if you grab some with your hands but we 're going to do with that toes right very good for ankle mobility and also very good for the feet in general okay because ideally we want our feet to be grabbing as much as possible okay so we want to almost encourage like the arch to happen a little bit in our feet so what we 're going to do is grab and then drag back a little bit so you can see what i 'm doing is i 'm trying to scrunch and pull that tail back with it okay and then i 'm dragging it back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back out again or if you want grab with your toes and just sort of drain out as much as you can and what you 're trying to do is literally drag it in with the toes and try to really get your toes in there to scrunch up and drag a little bit in with it so your toes are doing the grabbing okay another way of doing this or if you want i think so i 've done it a couple of times is uh you 've got a shower drop a towel or you need to dig up there grab your feet bring it up sometimes that helps as well because what you 're trying to encourage is the use of your toes to grip on and back up and down again all right now if you 're going to do two together you can do that but just make sure you 've got enough towel but don 't put it on then find out you 've got enough towel to do it okay so you can do it that way as well all right or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is zigzag so one then the other then the other the other and then slowly drag it back make sure you 've got a good purchase and doing that for roughly two minutes now if you find that you 've got issues with your feet and everything like that okay fine you may not be able to do the constant drag but if there 's a way that you can grab with the towel and do that okay see as you can see the grip loses but the idea is to encourage you grabbing so if you have to move it around and just get your toes in there anything given make sure you 've got the purchase and then bring it up that 's another way of practicing it if you don 't want to use a towel you can 't use the towel what we can do is imagine you 're trying to grip to the floor so you 're taking your hands it 's also your feet like your hands and trying to grip the floor so you grip yourself down and you 'll find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a better position to do so but as you do it you should feel your feet come up in almost an arch not too much but just another then relax squeeze tension and relax that 's another way of doing it as well okay very good for ankle mobility very good for your feet as well okay a lot of issues or a lot of time very commonly a few problems can arise from people say knees hips back a lot of it can also be tailed back to the feet because if your ankle was out of whack what happens is it brings your knees out of whack which then changes your hip which then changes another body part which has to take over okay we don 't have an engine light so it doesn 't flash on and go i have a problem with my knee we need to fix it well i have a problem in my foot we need to have a little bit of dress again our body is designed to keep moving so guys i 've got a problem before but what i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else differently i 'll get the hip to do something and that way i can still keep walking so what we 're trying to do here is just get everything to activate again or say we 're waking up some muscles again that go oh hang on i 'm going to be doing something here and this is one good way to start um now what we 're going to do with this is very simple again something you can do at work something you can do at home i don 't stress again about doing it excessively again at least two minutes but you don 't have to sit there for 10 minutes because even after a while actually doing is too much can be a little bit you know going backwards okay so everything within reason what we 're going to do with this ball is we 're going to place it on the ground now i 'd do this one at a time don 't do two balls or two feet okay it 's a bit probably a bit dangerous to do it that way plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to sort of create more pressure or ease off all right and this is good for this one i 'd like to say i 'm doing i 'm going to do this foot this one over here just to help me stabilize as well now what i 'm going to do here is i 'm going to use the ball to roll i 'll just do a side view here you can see in the middle of the foot okay you can use the whole foot all right even the heel i would also recommend a little bit of the heel but just for the moment we 're going to uh rolling here so in the plantar fascia um very commonly with a lot of people who might have plantar fasciitis what we 're going to do here is literally have the ball sit in a position that we find we can sort keep it stable but we 're now going to use our body weight or even the ball especially if you 're really sensitive you 'll probably feel it straight away but from there we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we want to which was i 'm going to do i 'm just going to lean forward on a little bit so i create more pressure in that spot now i 'm just going to let the ball create like a pressure massage in that area okay now only go as much as you can handle okay and don 't be constantly on this pressure for two minutes so press for a little bit and then back off little bit and sort of roll it out a little bit okay and then when you 're ready put a little bit more pressure hold for a few seconds and then release it off okay so don 't sit on this for two minutes because one it can get pretty um uncomfortable for such a long time but the idea of it is we 're sort of creating the move the pressure and the massage in order to try and get that muscle to open up a bit more um the way i sort of describe the plantar fasciitis or the plantar fascia when you 're sort of trying to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i describe it is that with your feet it 's almost like the muscle you know tightens up so it 's almost like your feet are curling inward so what we want to try and do is open up bit more so we 're aiding in that gripping of the foot again uh mobility of the feet as well okay when we sort of walk on the ground now what i 'm going to do here is i 'm just moving back and forth or you can move in a slight circle whichever you prefer if you want you can roll a living dog to your heels but just make sure as you can see you don 't want to sort of throw out like that if not just stay in this area and just move around now again if you find a really tight spot against that leaning in bit of pressure then back off again now the other thing you can do is as you give yourself some pressure try and curl your toes up and down while you 're holding that spot a little bit as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes relax it off and then go again pressure squeeze in squeeze out this also helps out as well it 's almost like you press down the mess on the muscle itself so if i want to use my arm as an example just say muscle there pressing down i then move within the range of what the muscles are meant to do will help out in and then release so we saw again try aid in getting to do things in what they 're actually designed to do okay so it 's not that everything turns off and suddenly your feet are gonna collapse and you 're gonna fall over it 's not that it 's just that we want remember when you think about how often do you spend standing on your feet you know a lot all right so when you 're walking around everything anything like this to help ease off that pressure or at least ease up the tension will help out the other groovy thing that you can do if you want and you can do that you have the time to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've shown you today 's specific knowledge you can give them a foot soak all right so the old foot um tub hot water epson salts give them a soap that also helps out as well because from there the magnesium and epsom salts and stuff gets absorbed through the skin okay not exactly deep into the muscles but it 's just a good way of relaxing your feet and um well we wouldn 't enjoy that anyway um so at least two minutes probably no more than five minutes i would say especially on this either side when you 've done the timer you simply switch the other foot okay i 've got myself my band okay it 's one of those like little loop bands if you don 't have that you have those other ones as long as you can create a bit of a wrap around the foot that 's okay just make sure it 's not too tight okay the idea of this is actually not to have it really really tight because we 're only moving in a very small range all right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm just going to pop it onto my feet all right now again you might need to waddle in and out just to find the best position possible for you but what we 're going to do from here is now you can do this two feet together or you can do one foot at a time it 's up to you okay what this is is we want to externally rotate or basically turn our toes upwards when we do this exercise but what we want to ideally do is not exactly completely lift the foot off okay so what what i 'm saying is we don 't lift up and then try and turn out because we don 't encourage the legs and the hips to do this exercise so what we 're going to do here is if i 'm using both feet i 'm going to slightly raise up the toes as you can see and then i 'm going to literally how do i go turn myself out a little bit trying to do it with the feet and then back in again okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally the feet themselves and then back down and relax now you can see very minimal movement it 's not a lot so we lift up we turn out and then come back in again okay the best way i can describe it is almost imagine that your feet kind of feel like they 're doing this kind of motion okay as you turn them out but like i said it doesn 't need to be you try and turn your feet out like this all right if you start doing that what will happen is other stuff kicks in all right that 's not we 're after literally just the feet turn them out you can hold for a second or two and then back in again some people might find the cars and everything kick in a little bit okay what i would suggest there is work on the idea of trying to minimize as much calf interference as you can and then back down again so i might mean to start with you don 't really move a lot outwards you 're not going to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't worry about that it 's not like you 're going to go to the point where you go oh my god my angle it 's not going be like that it 's just to promote that external use of the foot okay and then back down again now if you want to do it one at a time simply one foot lifts up turn out back down go to the other side this might be handy for the first time you 're doing this because what you want do is concentrate on one foot at a time get that external rotation happening and then bit by bit as you advance you can then do both feet because it 's easy to sort of try and go i 'm gonna do both and you 're like and you 're like i think i 'm doing it right just do one at a time and just feel where you 're going with your foot each time so we 're going to use this now so to start with a bit go on find myself into now this is too far so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into filling up 90 degrees okay and as you can see i 'm trying to get as much 90 degrees as possible all right now from there hand on legs and underneath this leg and then as i begin to push or pull my right leg up i push with my right hand down and then i bring it back with my left leg so what i 'm trying to do is fight both sides okay it can be a little bit challenging hold for a few seconds and then relax okay then again hand and pulling up pulling pressing back but then resist those two so ideally what you want to do is enough that you can feel you 're trying to keep your knees as even as possible all right and then relax and then we 're going to change the other side so hand this time goes here this hand goes on this leg on the left leg do the opposite so i lift with my left now and i push back with my right and then i resist both so i 'm doing like so only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some tight areas like typing clutches and stuff you may find that this kicks in a bit when that happens just relax deep breath and then go again and then try and do it for a little bit until that sort of cramping occurs and then relax okay now when you do this you can do it over the two minutes in total but you don 't have to be constantly doing it for two minutes so just say you do a couple repetitions like this okay wait a few seconds just let everything settle or if you want just completely relax your legs because you might find having it in that upright 90 degree position so it really encourages the hip flexors to fire so do that for a bit and then what you do is just reset and realign again and just again use that furniture to help out that 90 degrees and then set up again all right so lifting up push pull and then back down like i said the idea is keep it where you 're trying to keep your knees as even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roller now all um to help out with the back all right the two exercises we 're going to do today is going to be the lateria and the thoracic all right so what we 're going to do from here is lie at the roller like so and what we want to try and get in there is if you feel one way to describe the best way to use is where your armpit is roughly go back a little bit until you feel like a bit more fleshy or meaty parts there okay that 's where we want to roughly place our part of this body onto the roller all right and we 're basically going to stretch ourselves across you 're going to use your feet as a means of grounding and help yourself massage all right i 'll move across so what i 'm going to do lay myself down on my side so we 're going to do one side at a time and then from there i 'm going to sort of find the spot now you might find it well you might find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit back now if you go too far back okay something in the world is just that ideally you 're going to start getting more into the shoulder blade and everything like that we 're not exactly after that with this exercise today however you could do it a little bit later if you want that 's that 's totally cool so arm goes across you don 't have to really emphasize that stretch across as long as you can feel that you 've got that little fleshy like the meaty part of your back there all right now from here you can use your feet to guide yourself up and down if you want to do that that 's totally okay you 'll find that one leg needs to sort of push you up a little bit as you move back and forth like that or if you find one particular spot so it 's really tender you could just sit yourself there okay and then from here what you can do is just hold it or you can use the breathing exercise that we 've done before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there now with this one you won 't be able to squeeze per se but if you can give yourself a little force like maybe push into it a little bit and then relax and if you can feel if you 're slowly melting into the roller a little bit so you can feel that that pressure really ease off like trying to relax in that area yeah like i said two minutes at least per muscle area or per side all right now if you find that one air is really really intense okay what i 'd suggest is do it for a little bit and pack off and you know release it or find somewhere else or what you could do is just completely remove yourself away from it for a few seconds this might be a good time to stretch okay do some stretch exercises in the lats and so forth if you need to do that and then return yourself back down to find your spot and then again work through that now if you were using the ball you 'd simply do the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind if you are doing that you 're going to be a lot lower to the ground all right so just work that out if you 've got shoulder injuries and things like that if you can 't support your weight too much so it 's i would suggest do what you can manage because you don 't necessarily need to put a lot of pressure through the shoulder to hold yourself up it 's mostly in your feet all right and then from there just move back and forth now if you find that the moving is too much like i said stay still that 's all good as well all right now if you find that you can 't do that and you can 't do it one at a time the other option is and this is going to be similar to the thoracic exercise i 'm going to show you in a moment give yourself a hug rest yourself on the roller and then from there what you can do is just find a spot okay that you need to balance yourself on there keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift the bum up too much keeping it down and then what you can do is just turn side to side and that helps out a little bit as well you might find that there 's some tense areas through there that really work through there now if you want you can work itself down a little bit and do that all right so that 's another way you can do it and the other one is if you want to do a little bit more of the mid to low part of your back well set up the same now some people might just find that they do this they sit like this and just hold themselves there for a bit everyone then just drop themselves back again the key thing is keep your woods to the ground okay you don 't lift up and then tip yourself over all right we 're not exactly after that because don 't keep in mind that our spine isn 't exactly like a ruler all right so now if you 're going to do this hug yourself or cross over like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then back up again some people might find that you you can lift your hips a bit if you 're going to go back and forth so lift yourself up and you can sort of run up and down like that a little bit okay again just make sure you 're balanced all right and don 't do it ferociously nice and easy and then once you still find another spot just sit there and work through it okay so that 's another way you can sort of help out with back as well um if you find that you hear little pops or cracks don 't panic okay because you know sometimes can be just a little air pocket that builds up or it could be just the fact that you 're releasing a tight area so the spine is like oh you move around a bit more now so we 're going to go into the other exercise which is the thoracic mobility one i like doing this one again what we 're going to do with it is we 're going to use it uh as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a lot of disc work or everyday life we 're all still doing it anyway that whole rolling forward um you 'll find that a good area just to give you a rough guide is the thoracic will go from those from the spine point of view from i suppose the tip of your shoulders up here and i 'll go down to a line that goes across the back where your shoulder blades and or the tip of the end of the shoulder blades okay roughly roughly around my bed now when that um when we go through that what will happen is when we do the exercise just to know our spine is not completely straight it 's more in a s curve when we do this exercise your spine roughly sits like that ideally okay a very slight curvature now when we do it we 're not aiming to create a situation where our spine is you know completely straight or coming back like that okay when it just won 't happen but what we want to encourage even that in a person is still aiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very minimal again okay it 's not a huge movement so when we do this what i see a lot of people commonly do is it 's almost like they 're trying to wrap themselves over the roller or whatever varieties they 're using we 're not entirely after that okay um we just want it to be that we can slightly lift up our chest the feeling should be raising up the chest or puffing up the chest if you try and sit there for a second and then puff your chest up so you 're trying to lift that chest up that is literally the majority of the movement we 're after we 're just trying to do it on the ground using a pin basically or a big rolling pin like before when we did the lats we 're going to set up in a similar way except we 're just going to have our nice bed because we 're going to use the feet to sort of roll over and hold ourselves there so what i 'll do from here is have the roller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the back of the shoulder blades one thing that i want to encourage here is with your arms imagine you 're trying to really hug yourself okay so what you 're doing is trying to get the shoulder blades to open up like that all right that feeling now again it 's not going to be huge okay so don 't expect to be like that okay but you want to imagine that you 're trying to hug yourself as much as you can all right now the way i love to do it is i like to sort of lower myself down first set up give myself a hug and then get in the position now with the feet just as long as you stay stable all right and with your glutes or your hips what i want you to try and do is keep them to the ground as much as you can then from there imagine that feeling if you 're puffing the chest up so we lift our chest and then we return back again so as you can see it 's not not huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we come back down again try and keep the hips we don 't want to have a situation where you lift the hips up from it okay it 's on the end of the world if you do but ideally we 're trying to just really focus on that thoracic area so lift the chest up and back down again and then what you can do is you can just do it back and forth if you want to do it that way that 's fine or you can lift it up for a few seconds keep yourself there and then back down again okay the main thing is what you 're trying to do is encourage movement don 't roll down to the point where you 're starting to feel like you 're getting really really close to your neck and not after that and don 't bring yourself up too high here okay because that 's not what we 're totally after it 's more just where the shoulder blades still begin and end okay and then from there we 're just lifting the chest and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down while maintaining the glutes to the ground all right now that 's pretty much it with that movement all right now if you find that that 's a real struggle for you like i said even if you just sort of find the spot with the roller and or whatever you 're using hold your arms and even just trying to sort of sink yourself a little bit into it that 's okay if not even just sitting here you might find people be to start with to be weird but then as you 're showing it useful your body will sort of adjust a little bit as well so you can do that also if you find your neck is really really kicking in two things can do if you want to cheat it get your tongue to the roof of your mouth activate some muscles within the neck to stabilize or the other option is that you might sort of roll yourself back up for a few seconds let yourself relax it down and then come back down again okay hopefully those exercises help you out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body work okay i think that they 're pretty some key ones to do once you sort of master them or practice them over and over again and then become master of them you 'll find they can do them really quickly the frequency of them i would say as per needed so if you find that hey you work at the desk a lot i would suggest certainly doing a lot of that thoracic stuff in your back you might want to do that every second day or every third day to begin with eventually you might find it as a daily thing that you do okay that 's entirely fine uh however the other stuff like say for example foot mobility and everything we did today is brand new for you you might find just so you do it today for example you might find tomorrow is a bit stiff and sore in the feed because you haven 't exactly released something like that before don 't panic it 's not like you 've broken anything unless you 've done something really outrageous it 's just that again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body 's like what are you doing to me this is different and it goes through the doms or it goes through some moments where it 's like all a sudden i 'm really freed up now and i 've been really stiff and sore so what i suggest is it 's brand new to you do it for one day give yourself a day 's rest or two days rest and then go back to it gently again anyway for now take care,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

AUS,VIC,Hobsons Bay City Council,Hobsons Bay City Council,https://www.youtube.com/c/HobsonsbayVicGovAu,Hobsons Bay Movement in Isolation week 6 with Kara,U2udHSqt5Ac,20200611,1179.7,"115 Civic Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",3735,[Music] hi everybody my name is Cara I 'm the exercise physiologist and today we are talking about stretching the importance of stretching is to maintain our mobility in our joints and our flexibility as well so really important that if we can throughout our week find some time to stretch aiming daily if we can at five or ten minutes really really good routine is to start in the morning so you can do some stretches in bed to warm stuff up and as you 're getting some throughout your day if we can that would be ideal other forms of stretching with they 're really beneficial eating such as yoga so if you love something like that that 's really good or if you 're looking at doing something like that there 's lots of different levels that you can do and also activities such as Tai Chi are also really really good for your flexibility and your balance so there are activities in a community that do have yoga and Tai Chi so have a look at the moment they may not do favorite however everything will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming months so keeping here out because it 's really really good to get into the groove of stretching now stretching as I said is really good for our range of motion and our flexibility and that helps with us to do activities of daily living so having worried about noise helps of things such as reaching up to the cupboard brushing our hair and it could be putting on your jacket putting on your trousers all things like that are easy I 'm gonna join samurai ball if I join Steve we might not be able to move our arm too much or we might not be able so it 's really important to do some daily stretches to make sure we do remain mobile stretches are also really important to reduce some muscle tension so you may find that doing an activity for a certain amount of time or sitting in a position for a certain event I more generally is being stressed can cause of tension throughout your muscles so could be your neck your shoulders or it could be a back so I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you are stretching I did some breathing so do you stretch focus on breathing in breathing out while you do it and that can help to bring the blood flow to your muscles and again to reduce that tension and that stress feeling and that 's really important to help manage your muscles as well so a really really good thing to add in now when you are stretching there is a fine line between pain and then stretching so what we want to make sure is that you don 't stretch to when you feel pain that 's stretching too fast you want to make sure yes if you feel a bit of a pool you might feel some tension in your muscles that 's normal but you don 't want to stretch to where you feel pain so what I would recommend is even the stretches that I go through today start at 10 seconds see how you feel swap sides if you need to 10 seconds again and then see how you go and then over the coming weeks you can slowly build it up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you 're over there is nothing wrong started at 10 seconds and doing a few reps you might do one leg for 10 seconds the other leg for 10 seconds and they 'll repeat that twice and that 's going to be just as effective at the moment and just start to get you rooming and think of moving your joint and your large muscle groups first so your shoulders your hips you 've been dying the CIL 's and your arms and things like that get the easy ones moving first before you start to delve into some other stretches now today we go through some standing some seated and some lying down stretches again as always please only do these if you feel safe to do so and in terms of if you have any injuries or any known conditions that you know you may not go to remove your arm in that way if we do something please don 't do it and seek medical advice before you do or find someone likely to help you get started with a stretching program so really really important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing those activities that we do so the more we move and the more we stretch just the easier things will get and that 's all that we want to do is just be able to do the things that we love so if you need today I will do some seated exercise as I said laying down I will show you if you want to you can always do these in bed or on your couch if you do not feel comfortable on the floor again if you 're uncomfortable on the floor and you know that you may not be able to get up once you do you on the floor please don 't complete the laying down stretches and just stay with the seated stretches for today so I will start those churches now all right guys are we going to start with some seated stretches now these are my favorite because you can do them anywhere whether you 're sitting at the TV or you might be working at a desk you absolutely do throughout your day so they are bigger twos now as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder rolls now anyone can do these with whatever mobility you 've got you can do small ones if you need to start we can start with be quiet so let 's talk with me and again as I said in the video I stopped by some breathing everything in three nice after you mouth and really try and move those shoulders I always say to stop backwards just purely because our posture a lot of the time is forward when we 're doing things so it 's always nice to feel shoulder I was going siding with 10 is a good number again you might be gonna do small ones that 's fine all right have a rest today give me a massive bit of a rest and next one is going to be a next stretch where we 're just going to move our ear towards our shoulder you 're going to hold as I said try for 10 seconds and then coming up slowly and slowly to the other side now I just go anywhere you can you might be in a little bit you might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to do is a shoulder stretch where you put your arm across this one 's a bit tricky so start with your arm across then put your hands on the outside of your elbow and you 're going to pull your arm across your feel a stretch across your shoulder it 's nice one to start with but take your time this picture here to get again just start with 10 seconds and then swap the arm goes across your body behind your other and pull you can look it into your arm if you want or you can just pull it across and you feel a nice little stretch in your shoulder and at the top of your back I mean if you shake your arms out my next day of exercise is a seated hamstring stretch now this one the favorite it 's really really good one for underneath your thigh and it 's just not easy to do say to there 's some staining and Alania option to find this is the safest and the easiest to do for a day so first things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you 're nice and safe we 're just sweeping your bottom to the end you 're going to play some wonderful forward on your heel okay put your leg as straight as you can and your toes pointing towards the roof you 're gonna go into place both of your hands onto your thigh and you 're going to slightly lean forward now for some people where I am now is absolutely nothing more stretch and you 'll feel it at the back of your thigh for others if you can you keep rolling so when you feel the stretch and you hold and then you sit up and then you spots you put your other leg out nice and straight heel to the floor and toast to the roof both hands go on the fire and you 'll slowly roll down to weaken until you feel the stretch and you hold as I said stop ten seconds foot back and then do twice on each side okay now we 're starting with our standing stretches so a good want to start with for our feet mobility isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing nice and tall and you want to push one hip to one side and then push the other hip to the other now you can have bad knees absolutely fine just slowly move keep deep okay and then we 're going to do a circle so pretend you 've got your hula maybe for me your hula girl and you 're going to do a hip circle I like to have my hands on my hips just to see how they 're moving I would do five one way and then you stop and then you know five the other way this is just really good for our hips but also good for our lower back starts to release those muscles that might be a little bit tight do two more you can do little ones or you can do nice big ones just to see how your body is feeling on that day all right check it out so keeps it feeling nice and warm now another one we can do for our lips is a standing quad stretch now this might be tricky for a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you one version is holding on to the wall lifting your foot to your bottom and then stretchy any hope you feel it in the front of your thigh okay so front on it looks like this and you 're holding onto your foot all right then I 'll show you another option which will make this one a little bit easier so this same speech here is your quad stretch okay this one either say if we have a chair we have a 5-bit and what you do is your place your foot onto the chair and in that position you will start to feel that fire stretch okay so it 's same thing what I need to do is get that foot up to stretch that quad if you just need to start off and you 're feeling a bit tight you put me foot onto the chair and you 'll feel that stretch in your thigh so that 's another option that you can do now another standing one which is a nice one for the shoulders I 'll show you side on firstly and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoulders back your hands will clasp together behind you and you 'll Ames you pull your hands down towards the ground and push your chest out okay you feeling really nice stretch through the top of your back and also through the front of your chest now if it was front time you roll your shoulders back and you put your hands face fingers facing the ground and clasp your hands together and then your aim to fall down now so you might just be able to get there so one other one you can do is just place on your lower back and then push your chest forward okay it 's to only give you a really really nice stretch through the shoulders but if you 're feeling like you can use clasp those hands together and pull them towards the floor okay again you just hold for 10 seconds you might need to shake it out again you 're stepping up SHINee 's hands on your back push your chest forward you 're still gonna feel that really nice stretch through your shoulders and through your upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now another one that 's quite similar again I 'll show you side on is your clasp your hands together at the front and then you just try oh top of your back and feel my speech stretch down to the floor and then standing up again and again you can shake it out if you need to if that is a bit tricky again just start with some shoulder rolls and by getting some mobility through your shoulders you will then be able to hold them back and then be able to do that stretch so a few options again choose which one you feel most comfortable with and just start with a 10-second hold and then release and then do another ten-second hold and then just see me feel okay guys and this exercise is a calf stretch so this is really good for a long part of our link very good if you 're walking or you may feel some tightness through your ankles or for the lower part of your leg is to do a nice and easy pass trips now I will show you side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easiest way you can do it so first thing is front foot forward and then your back leg back that 's called a split stance you 've got one foot forward one behind all you want to try your best to do is keep your back heel on the ground and your back leg as straight as you can okay will then pop your hands in the wall and you just aim to put your body weight forward so your name you push that front knee forward and then you will hold that stretch now again use back leg straight and we 're trying our best keep our back the only now you have really tight muscles you might notice that your heel is off that 's fine if you stretch to where you can again be sunny with ten seconds and then you swap so I 'll couple legs into it this way but my hand a little one foot forward one behind my back leg is nice and straight my heel is on the floor and the moment pushing my body weight forward and pushing that front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can feel a nice big stretch in the back of my legs so that is called a standing calf stretch all right guys I 'm now going to show you some examples on the floor now as I said previously let me complete them on the floor if you are able to get on it off the floor safely and independently if you cannot do them on the floor that 's absolutely fine don 't feel like you have to do them but you can also do them on the bed and again only do them if you feel safe okay so we 're gonna just go through a few and I like to do these a little warm-up in the morning really good for the lower back in the legs and gets our body moving so it 's going to lay down and the first one I 'm going to do single leg knee to chest so what I 'm going to do is bring my knee to my chest then I 'm going to relax this other leg down and again I 'm going to focus on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold for ten seconds then we 'll place that leg down and we 'll bring out other knee to our chest so see the leg knee to chest focus on your breathing during some stretches you might like to close your eyes absolutely fine using us some time for yourself some time to relax okay again I would do two on each side and use aiming for 10 seconds see how you go if you don 't have the mobility in your hips you may not be able to bring it that high just go to where you can or you might want to use a towel to help you that 's also fun alright my next one is both knees to yes all right and this is one of my favorites it 's a knife release for your lower back and again you 're going to breathe in and breathe out and really focus on relaxing your shoulders down beautiful next one is placing your feet on the floor these are called love my rolls but I would just say in the rocks from side to side now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ones so firstly I needs it together and our feet are together you have your hands in the ground slowly rock from side to side now there is a big stretch that some of you might do where you might bring your knees all the way to the floor and that 's up to you but this one 's a favorite of mine just start slowly warm up the back with having to do too much work to pull it back up again so you must slowly up from side to side think you know what start with 10 and don 't go too far again breathing buna for and then pump arrest my next favorite one is feet hip-width apart so you can open up your feet again and you 're going to lift your arms to the roof now first option is arms come up and then arms come down now this is really good for shoulder mobility and then what you 're going to aim to do is go as far as you possibly can without pain as I said you never want to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel kind of mobility will let you keep going all the way fires you can and again focus on your breathing and you use relaxing start again if you feel like today you 're going to get to here that 's where you stop and you go back down and I want you to try eight to ten reps I mean if you can try and do these as much as you can once at that even start with in the morning it 's gonna be really nice be shoulders so just see how you go let your whining down shoulder raise just start with eight to ten and then see how you go alright the last thing that I 'm gonna finish with is are we do it again if you feel like you can either glute stretch each placing your heel onto your opposite knee now I will show you and I 'll move around and show you what that looks like are you going to pop your heel onto your other knee the first option is just to leave that there okay so you 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's really tight and you might feel a big stretch that 's fine again start with 10 seconds so you just hold there you 're trying to relax you 'll bring you foot down and you 've got other side put on teeny try this to relax you want to try and keep both Peaks on the floor so you don 't a roll just try and keep your both knees down and you 're trying to relax that leg breathing in [Music] bring me out just trying to relax okay that 's option one you can see you better on that able so my foot is on my knee and it makes it which looks like kind of like a backwards four it 's called a four-point straighter just for you glutes okay so you hold that one now a second option is a little bit harder so I only do this if you feel able is you pop your heel onto the stage issue on to uni the front of you need you 're gonna grab that knee and bring it towards your opposite shoulder so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right shoulder and I can feel it stretching my bottom and a little bit in my lower back now for some of you this might be a bit sore in your groin if it is just don 't do it okay then we 'll swap on the side put on to the front of your knee right leg bringing it towards my left shoulder again I 'm gonna hold for 10 seconds and then I 'm going to leave it there so just try those when you 're at home again really do them if you feel safe and just start with 10 seconds great day to sign up your day in bed get warmed up and then see how you thanks guys I hope that has helped and I will see you next time,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",3112,hi everybody my name is Cara Layton I am the exercise physiologist working with you guys and hostels baby 's here to help you all stay active all over at home if you haven 't exercised in a while or you have a new health condition or you 're just not quite sure please contact your GP or a trusted health professional that you 're currently working with to get clearance before you complete some exercises now before we complete our exercises today we 're just going to have a general chat about the benefits of exercise and the list is huge it goes on and on and on so firstly the main points that include the benefits of exercise improving our fitness okay improving our muscle strength improving our balance which would then reduce our risk of Falls and improve our mobility so that means that you know to walk around easier and complete activities at home with ease all right which is already really important the other benefits of exercise include management of conditions such as high blood pressure high cholesterol type 2 diabetes and there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main thing I want you to think about during these times is that exercise helps to improve our mood it makes us feel good okay I can guarantee after some sort of movement you will feel better okay exercise helps to boost our mood as I said it helps to improve Ashley which is also really really important and it helps reduce feelings of anxiety and depression okay in this time when we are at home there 's lots of things changing around us as lots of different situations that we 're in it 's really really important that we get moving to make us feel good and that is the main main thing think about you do what makes you feel good so if for you make me feel good is going for a 10-minute walk great if you it 's riding a bike even better if someone else it means doing a Zumba class inside or dancing around in their lounger while they do some cleaning great okay all we want you to do is move as much as we can and in a way that makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much should I do okay now according to the Australian Physical Activity Guidelines they do you recommend 150 minutes of moderate activity per week which equates to about half an hour for a day now if you have an exercise in a while as I said I always recommend starting with 5 to 10 minutes much much more achievable we also use it as a point to make sure we 're feeling good again we 're not too sore it 's not exacerbating any pain anywhere because as I said we want to feel good ok we want to use this exercise to make us feel better so if you can start with a 10-minute walk or a 5-minute walk up the street and back or around the block at home that would be a great stuff ok if we can do our exercise outside that 's even better ok because studies show that exercising outside also helped to boost our mood so it 's really really good to have clear the mind and it just makes us feel a little bit better to get out into some fresh air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block great if the weather isn 't really letting you do so that 's fine walk up and down your hallway or do some zip ups at home there are really really good ideas now in terms of what we 're doing today we 'll be doing a few exercises and as I said before making sure that you are feel nice and safe I will give you two options we will be doing level 1 and we 'll be doing level 2 now I recommend if you haven 't exercised in a while or this is your first time exercising please only complete level 1 exercises ok you feel good after that great then we can come back and visit this video again and you can try a level two but for today please just complete level one throughout all the exercises please only complete them if you feel safe if for some reason you feel a bit uneasy just have a sit down and have a breather again if you have an exercise please get clearance before you do so sorry first thing I want you to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good okay you want to use it to make us feel good and make it feel better to do what you enjoy so that means dancing Landru or going for a bike ride do whatever you like because I can guarantee if you enjoy doing it you will certainly you need some ideas we will go through some exercises now okay if you need to pause this video right now pause this video and grab yourself a chair or you 'll need today is a chair please you don 't have a chair with wheels make sure the chair is nice and sturdy such as your kitchen chair or a desk chair something nice and sturdy please do not use your couch as I said or any chance with wheels so a nice 30 chair and we will get ready for some exercises alright guys we are ready to do exercises we have got our nice dirty chair to sit on ok nice 30 with a nice back so that you can use the back to sit on ok so sitting down in your chair have your feet hip-width and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stay flat on the ground the whole time for this exercise now our first exercise is called a sit to stand now if you do have handles on your chair right use them to start with bc is level 1 so using your handles on your chair you will stand up tall use your handles again and you will sit back down onto the chair ok if you don 't have handles on your chair use the bottom of your chair so you gotta have your hands there or if you cut there and have a wide enough chair you pop your hands underneath your thighs underneath your next and you push up from the bottom of the chair and stand up and then you hold on to the chair and you sit down you come up again standing up tall and sitting down do one more see any up tall ok they are called city stairs now we 're going to have a rest I recommend at least 30 seconds to a minute of rest in between each set or each round of exercises ok so if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really really good friend leave my scores and a whole combined exercise that we use every day we need to get on off the toilet or we need to get in and out the car off the couch and the kitchen chair lots and lots of benefits for this exercise it is my favorite so if you only pick one exercise this is the one for you ok if you 're on level 1 as I said please feature that exercise so continue with your handles or continue with using the base of your chair for support if you 've done this exercise before or this maybe a second or third time in to click you are completing these exercises sorry place your arms across your chest feet flat on the ground push through your heels and at all again you will sit back down good job stand up tall sitting back down good job use your legs to push yourself up we 've got two more coming up okay have a little breather you need to rest your arms you can if that position isn 't comfortable for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however that we 'll be able to do it harder so again level one hands on the chair or hand on your handles for support there were two arms across your chest or arms out either throat arms across my chest okay alright let 's go everybody make sure your feet are flat on the ground and if you 're doing it slower than me that 's also fine if you 're gonna be quicker that 's easy that 's also fine as well two more reps and that makes five well done everybody that is called a sit to stand okay next exercise is an heel race so what you need to do is hold onto the end of your chair feet underneath your hips so there will be a hip width here if they are too close together that puts us a little bit off balance okay so making sure when you do stand at any time that you have a nice base of support and that 's good for your balance and your stability okay so this exercise we will stand in this position holding on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our heels and then down just one ticking up one second now holding on to the chair level one five okay today we 're doing five reps this might be the first time for you that you 've exercised in a long time so we start nice and slow and over the coming weeks we will make it a bit harder all right we rest again now if you are level two you can try with one hand or you can try with fingertips so you only put your fingertips on the chair at the end it rather than gripping the chair you hold your finger tips and you come up or you can do one handed okay you pick what 's good for you but if you are lever one you must hold on to the chair oh yeah good job alright now you will feel that in these muscles here that is Noir so we 're working their muscles at the back of our leg and it is really very important to make strong to help us with our walking okay we 're going to do one round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so again level one holding on to the chair level two you do your fingertips on the chair or you just hold with one hand okay let 's go round five to go one picking up one sitting down so the slower you use movement the harder it will be so just for now one second up okay well done that is called a standing calf raise or a standing heel right so if you do say that in you it that is that exercise okay after an exercise excuse me if a leg up leg tap to the side we 'll call it so you 're going to be using your chair but this is just to show you the movement your label tap and toe tap okay but for us we hold onto the chair so if you can see me my hands are on the chair again I 'm saying nice and tall first to go inside of my right leg bring my right leg it up and they don 't come and they come back in this works out heat muscles and very very good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my toes and they come back in and I tap my guitar and I come back in okay then I swap sides for you guys I 'm going to do it front on just so you can see from this way so this is my left side tap tap and then even up holding on tap in to wrong well done okay you have a wrist we 'll go back to side on okay have a little bit of a break I do shimmy over the movie feel like okay it 's working out big blue muscles here which is you now to keep very very good for us okay we need strong hips and strong muscles there how we go walking in touch with that general movement okay back again to our right side so we 're standing tall we 're going to tap out oh now you don 't have to go out far you just do a little tap probably about 30 minutes or so make sure you 're looking ahead nice and tall good job and then you go in and swap sides that you stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any more to go 300 good job so I can feel my hips rolled up and you might feel a little bit and that 's completely normal that 's showing us that our muscles are working okay so then it 's our side toe tap on this exercise either backwards toe tap so what we 're going to do is bring our leg behind tap out time and bring it in so bend your leg straighten it out bend it back here now if we try and straighten it fully and they will just drag in my head we don 't want so you want to be like to lift it straighten it out you using this big muscle here in your bottom and then you 're bringing it back in again level while we are holding onto the chair the whole time that 's five good job and we 'll do our left leg so we 've seen on an arrival Igor people waiting oh right good job okay that 's five on each side now lower one as I said is holding on level two you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement without holding on same thing is back tap and forth back tap and forward now these will add in a balance component for you so again do you feel a bit wobbly you making sure you 're grabbing a hold of the chair once more rest good job now if you do want to go from level one you 're thinking you might want to give it a go again you can use your fingertips so this just means we 've got less upper body support so you just in your tips now we 're giving our left leg left leg comes back good job that 's three four five well done so that 's your toe tap back all finished very very good our next exercise that we 'll be doing is marching on the spot so this time we 'll be standing next to our chair with one hand holding on and we 're going to lift our legs okay so just like walking on the spot but nice and slow doesn 't have to be quick we 're going to do 20 over there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some it might be like this like this and for some you might be feeling really good today and you might be able to get your legs up nice and high okay and then we rest then while we 're resting is level 2 is no hands and what I want you to do is start to use your arms when you 're going okay so level 1 will be having your hold on your chair as you do your leg lifts level 2 will be walking you know either have your arms down or if you want an extra challenge you 're going to go with your arms as well okay so we 're going to start now one two three oh five good job we 're nearly there we 've done one smokes and exercises already okay the next one I 'm going to get you to sit back down into chair just as we 're finishing off and I 'm going to do some ankle circles so lifting your leg up slow and then stop and then try your best to go five yeah that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two hard to lift your foot that 's fine you pop your heel on the ground and you do the same thing stop all the way alright so you pop your heel on the ground and then you do circles as you heels on the ground okay alright shake the lake that we 've nearly finished our exercise for today we 're going to finish with some shoulder rolls backwards now this is the good wine I can do this any time throughout the day a lot of us at home we 'll be sitting a bit more than normal so we might be feeling it a little bit neck shoulders that 's completely normal so let 's do some shoulder off to release Emma be okay well done you completed all your exercises

Altona VIC 3018, Australia",5358,I don 't come back today I 'm going to do some exercises that work in line with what cars spoke about in Kairos my friendship so today I 'm gonna run you through some exercises that will aid in leg strength particularly each individual leg alright we 're going to work on exercises that are going to be a little bit different but they 're very good even with bodyweight or you can apply some resistance to it as well okay so we 're going to go onto the first exercise in the first exercise is going to be what 's called a cycle SWAT okay soccer squad is a squat that are sometimes referred to is also a heels raised squat it 's to aid in mobility from if someone 's got very tight carves they might fine or what it 's a good way to get a better movement through your squat okay if you find that you saw come down and you get jammed up where you feel like I 'm stuck this is as best as I can go it 's the help with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it 's been given to beginners okay however advanced exercises can certainly get a lot of benefit out of it as well all right you know what I 'm using today is some steps okay all the back of the steps what you would need to look at is if there 's a way that you need something like a plank of wood or any object that is firm and stable that allows you to feel like you 've come onto your tippy toes okay and by I 'm sorry about tippy toes like just a ball of the foot okay so we don 't want to complete your feet like this we want to feel that it 's only slightly raised for some people you might need a little more some people need a little bit less okay the reason I 'm using my Reebok step is that there 's a couple of little levels on here all right so if I really wanted to I could put my heels right at the back of it and really elevate my feet but they were just going use that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so by snipping on that first part of the step you can see my heels have come up no I 'm going to use it to just for the sake of spacing now what will happen is you should have nothing your heels raised okay then you can feel that there 's a change in your foot position but you can still feel the ball of your feet and the toes on the ground okay so the toe should should we live that there 's we have a clamp to the great now exactly like in the first video with the squat the movement is exactly the same we 're gonna tilt the hip okay we 're going to drop ourselves down with the idea of pushing our knees forward right make sure you chose a Slovak turning down again all right now if you haven 't seen that video we 'll just do a quick one toes are lined up roughly along the shoulders if not slightly apart the then front part the toes slightly turned out all right not a lot so not opened up feet then from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just gonna have my arms out for me okay if you want to use some sort of resistance you can you might see some people to do that both aware on their back or they might be on resistance here at the front all right as long as you don 't tip forward okay that 's what we want to avoid you know I 'm doing this was bodyweight what would happen is I 'm just gonna hands down for me I 'm guys so it took my hip a little bit I 'm gonna then begin to descend down pushing my knees out and allowing myself to sit in this position now from here if you want a further resistance or challenge yourself hold this position for a few seconds but don 't relax so don 't switch off okay keep tension and then drive back up alright as you come down you should feel good knees slightly push air in the direction of your fate this allows you to open up and keep all right and also what 's good about this is given that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or your cars are tight it allows a bit of traction and ankle mobility as well but it helps with your back it keeps you in a better position from this move in this movie rather than tilting forward or rounding the back too much then from there we 're going to drive back up to a standing position nothing else changes we don 't need to do anything fancy we 're just keeping in the same movement as the squat we 're coming down bringing ourselves down and then pushing back up you know I 'm going to show you quickly a way of holding resistance with my dumbbell assistant oh yeah I 'm going to keep it so I don 't drive me always back so I 'm holding you here you can hold the dumbbell this way or some people might hold it this way again just make sure your elbows are in front of you don 't let everything tip you back this way alright just a little video so everything else it 's up I hold my weight and I drop the other and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble with this exercise called the soccer squad now what some coaches like to do with a true soccer squad you still come down slowly back up back down again and then driving back up or they might also ask the client so I 'll double to the side body like so coming down pushing up and driving up now ever you 're hopeful resistance is fine the key thing is to make sure you were balanced and stable particularly for your heels okay stable alright maybe wobbling what lean does not create strength okay just go for my sisters nobody so what 's good about the song squats really good for mobility really good for the knees helps out with your back and from there it 's actually still a challenging exercise to say that one if you have any questions don 't you notify me all right now the next exercise we 're going to go onto two variations okay I 've shown you the lunch before but we 're going to go through two different ones now one is gonna be a foot raised lunge or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real which race splits well well what sometimes known as a Bulgarian looks well okay so we 're going to go into that one now all right so the first one guys we 're going to do is the front foot elevators but squad what 's good about this one is it 's a good introduction to lunging again in the first video that I 've given some split lunges if you find that 's a real struggle this is actually another step that you can regress the exercise but you can still go a lot about of it okay a lot of times coaches would probably use this as a means to one educate in the hip mobility okay very good as a single leg exercise again coming back to our for prevention but also very good for the VMO which is one muscle here it 's part of our thigh what about which is also a handy in stabilization of need generally what will happen is was one golden rule is if this particular muscle through here is weak one of the commonality is the dropping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that but it 's a side effect of it okay what 's good about it also this one as well today I 'm just using my step well the height from Romania they can be so some people might have a step this high some people might need to use a step a little bit higher or a little bit higher again okay some people might need a chair height alright again make sure whatever you 're using is very strong very stable okay both the object itself so the step and also that you can be stable on it as well again you don 't want something that 's going to and throw you like these okay that doesn 't create strength alright so what we want is a stable purchase set up exactly the same way as you 're doing a money by the different is whatever your front foot is so in this case it 's my leg leg it 's going to go above all on top of today my step no the back leg sets up the same so you guys as far back as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that you have to do all the way back like that alright it also don 't be here with today though you take a bit of practice but you 'll get there the service the same back leg if part of my right foot back for this video so what will happen is when I pop them I throw my right heel will slightly turn out to the right my left leg is near on the step from here the rest of my posture is trying to keep as upright as possible okay you can slightly to up the hip forward a little bit as well okay other options are if you want more a stretch in this leg or in the back leg push your hip forward a little bit tilted forward so or one of the cue is squeeze the bum squeeze the glute on the back leg side so if my right leg is back I 'm going to try and squeeze my glue on my right side okay from there the same cues what will happen is the front knee is going to go forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still maintain an upright posture so as I do that you can see I 've descended you know now what will happen is the occasional thing about is this way touching the cup okay and then from there we 're going to stand back up again so front leg it goes forward we push forward and then come back let your back knee bend okay don 't keep it stiff because you restrict yourself okay if I keep it really stiff my try go forward you can see I 'm jammed up a ladder of the native bend going forward and then they push back up now when you push back up push back from this lake but don 't push backwards push up so I 'm coming down I push myself up and the a nurse will come back a little bit all right don 't feel that you 're pushing yourself away from the object or wherever you 're standing you will come down lean forward pressing from the feet back up again all right there 's the fun push us with lunch yeah we set up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Bulgarian it 's more commonly known instead of the front foot main elevated local doing before I 'm going to put my back foot elevated okay it 's a more challenging lunch okay really stretch out above the back leg okay because again my right leg for this exercise of this demonstration it 's going to go forward alright so the back leg is going to work a little bit more right the exercise are very good for glutes your quads all that all that good stuff alright the reason that I 'm just using these is that it 's going to not be too hard on the feet make sure that when you do pop your foot on if you 're going to do this exercise don 't have the leg on like that okay because you want the movement in the ankle as you can see already I 'm stuck it 's pressing on machines so our marker just enough that you can still feel that being happening in your foot you know when you do this one to work out the distance that you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a little bit of trial and error you just go to slightly move you find foot forward enough that you can sort of feel that you 've got balance okay now if you 're going to try this exercise guys what else really to do it bodyweight first get a real good feel for it because even that bodyweight it 's a very challenging exercise there 's ways of burying it up I will have the sets and reps and everything for all the exercises today in a little sheet for you but out with that go with bodyweight first don 't just throw resistance straight into it okay you might be a being said it that 's fine but just go to body weight first alright because one you want to make sure whatever you 're using is stable you also want to make sure that you are stable doing it so don 't go throwing resistance in there because if you suddenly drops out or this you lose balance completely then you 've got resistance you 're on accidents so got my back foot up now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it wasn 't a lot I feel that you go drive the leg right in front okay now in terms of this one what we 're going to do from here is exactly the same we want to try and stay upright all right over the foot in a position and then from there you 're going to bend the knee listening you 're still gonna drive forward but what will happen is instead of falling you 're gonna fall forward okay you 're going to find that as you go you know back leg comes like so and then you drive back up again okay so there we go yeah let me draw it back up again front leg has to feel like you 're doing the work don 't press too much from the back leg so we come down drive me up from the front leg and not locking out the knee right knee does not lock out we can slightly bent so we 're coming down draw them back up with the foot now if you were gonna use some resistance with it you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can hold like this how about I find that very challenging and also from the point of view of if you haven 't done this before probably pretty risky doing me like this best option is keep it low okay and in front of the leg that is on your elevated object so then do my left leg again alright I have it here in front because that way I have space to move up and down as I did moving I mean down Rebecca even the body up right back up again so that one is the rear foot elevated at lunch or other bah-bah-bah yeah the next one we 're going to go to is going to be the lake go which will be lying on the floor that one will set up it 's a different variation the reason I 've got it is to help those we can 't do that deadlift video or the debit movement like this with the hinging the hip it 's just to help out with the hamstring a bit more so we 'll set for that and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of time you 've seen the gym a typical machine where everyone is lying down the other way so they 'll be on the machine okay and they 're going up and down with your legs all right what we 're going to do is a different variation of that again like I said before words now go with those have the mobility knee keeps to do the Romanian deadlift or you 'd end up video the road ahead the first week what we 're going to use is is a dumbbell you know you can use a resistance band if you have one at home however it 's a little bit of a difference but if I 'm using the dumbbell is a lot easier but also you can use other objects that you might have higher providers you can grip it with your feet so we 're actually gonna use I think to hold the weight all right it does take a bit to infer to sit so hot okay if it 's your father opposition but first of all before grab the right I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diem just laden yeah okay almost like this if you getting ready to do the plank exercise we did last week just as you but you 're always the ground hands can be aware that wouldn 't be alright you can be salty right now so you don 't have to be flat to the floor like these you slowly rise up low so all right and then maybe action we 'll be doing this however so I 'm gonna go up and there with the movement you know when you do this and I 'll show you you don 't have to bring it all the way up is in trying to get back to you because you 'll find when you 're holding something in your feet you would naturally won 't do that because you know that 's probably gonna so that they had a call on to you okay what we could do with a vein if you have the band because the vacants or whole range wrinkles or some other better the emphasis on this exercise is actually more with the tension of you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been coming back to this finishing position instead of being the force driving up with this way there 's coming up will be easy because you won 't have it you won 't have a very very heavy weight okay just wanting to just be too dangerous but also you 'll find that to have a hip email away you know lying around the house is very great all right so once I said yeah I 'm gonna get where I can hold there 's nothing this is one by myself if you got someone around to help you then give them help okay as you can see you know I 've picked it up with my feet yeah yeah from there what I 'm doing is I 'm then gonna basically almost about one other key thing switch glutes he began and then you 're going to bring it upwards now as I bring it up you can see my feet kind of flattened out a little bit alright that 's what we 're after I 'm so easily faked the whole now this is where most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to emphasize that over time is it so we 'll be going five four three two one back down right and what happened from there is they 're coming up is easy going back down creates a stretch to control and downs like she can as you can see doing it this way it 's certainly a lot more challenging because you 've got to hold the weight with you think as well as maintaining a smooth transition back to the ground so coming up squeezing glutes coming back down nice and easy now as you can see I 'm still walking with it but from there come back up now if you find here 's the top you can clearly relax like this okay on the end of the world there we were ideally your warrior but you finally come their fate squeeze the glutes didn 't return the back slightly back here okay this is going to let go with the dump with the weight all right you know if you ever been you can put the mail around the ankles you know change it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards instead backwards alright and we 're going to make sure the bag is on something solid so it doesn 't fly out from behind you all right well there again slowly come back down this morning eccentric face alright or in other words you 're working with tension in the point where the muscle is actually stretching back so stretching back yeah squeezing it back up slowly back down yeah back up again alright so that 's going to be the lake cold exercises you can use any resistance dumbbell I find really handy if you don 't have a dumbbell or something just something that you can grip with your feet securely I think I mentioned last week there 's milk crates or milk cartons you can use you pull with rocks okay again you try to use the liquids alright see there you go that now you find that your hamstrings are really tired so from that one again I 'd also go six and trading with the physio no car or my therapist just in case something else is going on or you can try the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really strange exercise or like I said I 'm going to introduce some mobility exercises as well I 'm a couple weeks normal so we can go through some hamstring releasing techniques as well alright so now we 're going to go onto the last exercise which would be the calf raise alright and we 'll go get some for that now so we 've done the leg curl so now I 'm going at once into copyrights with the copper exercise very good to help out with the ankle mobility alright just as much as it is can detail about the calf muscle itself well now with the young the citrus is obvious it might a little step up again closer to the wall just so I 've got something to lean on as I do this generally keep using a Jew machine some of that they 'll have padding everything in with a few balance okay so they 're doing this at home whereas juices have something around that you can just hold on to but don 't use it to aid you in lifting yourself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right now with the high post if as you see it 's very mineral alright so it 's two different to these four under so we had you don 't have to elevate really really high just enough you feel that you can drop your heel down and come back up on your toes and I 'll share that yeah being close to the wall I just want to be able to have it so I can just have my hand on water supposed to insurance thing so today I 'm going to show you with hopefully both think alright if not this can be buried up with a single leg as well so basically one leg at a time you know we 're not going to hop up the steam yourself up we gotta set yourself up what do you want to have he 's infinity one foot or so you can see the ball of the foot roughly still sits on the safe I 'm using my step ball still suits on my step with my toes also able to feel that I can still press that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't feel like here because I don 't know so they 're like this okay and now that I can feel if I need to I can drop my heel down to the ground that 's how we 're going to eat that stretch yeah my phone alone you already know how to do this or you practice it for Venus it 's a very good way of stretching out your calf muscle when they put a little tight we 're gonna find a lot of rubbers do it okay very handy yeah the voice type out a couple things you can vary your foot position so with that you could have your feet all straight out you can slightly turn your toes England you can slightly turn your toes outward or you need to bring your feet a little bit closer together either way it 's not wrong just a different variation of working the muscle all right the other thing though says when you do people step that you 're going to use make sure it 's of course firm and solid just like the other exercises but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with you thing you don 't to have it like just so you 're doing it outside or like you might have a dick or a stick that 's our don 't have it that it 's weight or it 's gonna be a Jew or anything like that so make sure it 's secure for yourself as well so I mean wanna do a bit affort and everything like that that 's okay do it again just make sure you 've got a good solid grip alright so how about from there one one because you shouldn 't use my wall as a balance now when I do this what I 'm going to do first these drop myself down so allow my car to feel the stretch you can so sorry push yourself anything want but you don 't get this very white it 's okay leather strips happened what you going to do with your toes and they can return grip the step in your toes whip them down so you brick walls instead as you can grip or once you integrate push upwards if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tippy toes alright feel the car thing tighten up and feel that it 's like really tense then slowly lower yourself down and allow yourself to fall into that stretch again okay so feel the stretch so much for singing from the ball of the foot all the way out there with tension in the car and it 's already saying like that against that stretch position and the reason we 're doing these but I need to work right through as much as stretch and strength position as possible in the cop we 're not going to bother yeah I know the dog is do that when they go to sit up and again they 're doing that because they dive from God knows what all right so that 's what they do what we doing here is stable strong the other stretch and driving back up feeling tension through the car okay now we need to change the foot position on this exercise you 'll feel different parts of your car will be emphasized right now on that again it 's more against how about the ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few mobility videos as well which I focus heavily on a few calf and ankle mobility exercises because I 've gone through the essa juicing so far tonight the Lord is to aid in both need quad hips and so forth but if your calves are at the time a lot that can be restricted in a way so the exercise we 've done to that so that 's very challenging to do you know squats or anything like that if not only it can heaps of time but also if he cars are really tired as well and the thing is about cars is that pretty much as soon as you 're doing this they 're going to be used so very very rarely do they kind of get a break from what they need to be doing now if you want to use some resistance okay I 'm going to look you can 't resistance both sides if you want however again I would make sure it 's a little safety first to make sure you stay looks okay to use the wall as a reference from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do single leg so just so you take one leg away you go drop down the one leg in back up and down have one side with the leg away so I 'm gonna go all the way all right some people might be the cross way they might be handy for balance okay but personally I like doing all the same song yeah both it doesn 't matter just as long as you can feel that it 's you need some resistance now it 's not going to mean that your bra size is going to all more than your other side it just there 's just a place for decisions okay and then from there is still the same thing coming down through the stretch written with the toes driving back up okay Danny also might want to help as well if you find that you can really advance the exercise and you saw you know you can feel it working you sweetie balloons a little bit as well that also helps back down again good stretch slowly work on that which will help out an ankle mobility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first say that if you work when he cops you know I 'm not going to build up so dope gonna be bulky so you don 't have to worry about will Korea with you know the gym you I was going to see cars per own definition it 's more about to help out in a cool flexibility okay there you go that one as well hopefully those exercises help you out during isolation if you have any questions or anything you know we 're climbing from the love of the guys the sets and reps will be in the handout that are bringing out this video little bit different to what we did with the upper body alright given that we 're using the legs we want to get more strength in power ok but I 'll show you how I want you to form like that alright alright how do they see you guys soon,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",3207,hi everybody my name is cara i 'm the exercise physiologist working with hopkins bay and today we are talking about falls prevention now falls is the leading cause of injury and hospitalization in older adults and it really is a topic that we need to chat about to include these exercises into our week studies show that doing 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days or all days in addition with two hours of strength and balance exercises per week reduces your risk of false so last week we spoke about strength exercises today we 're going to talk about balance exercises and the ideal is we combine them both and complete a total of two hours per week of both of those exercises okay so lower limb strength is also a risk factor for falls so it 's important that we do our leg exercises just as much as we do our balance exercises to reduce our risk of falls okay now in terms of starting exercise if you haven 't done any balance exercises before start now so age is not a barrier it doesn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance exercises and your strength exercises now and you will still still sorry reduce your risk of false now it is also important that you do make sure your home environment is safe prior to completing your exercises but also just in general so making sure that you reduce your risk of falls by making sure there isn 't any objects on the floor you pack away things you make sure that you 're wearing nice comfortable shoes preferably not slippers and preferably not barefoot and making sure that you do feel safe other things could be chatting to your doctor or chatting to your family or health professionals about home modification so that could be getting help with a bar to help get up the steps to get into the house it could be a bar in a toilet to help you get on and off the toilet or in the shower to help reduce your risk of falls in the shower by having something to hold on to so that could be something that you discuss as well as personal alert systems so this is something where maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lives by themselves where they can have a personal alert system where if they do happen to have a fall or they feel unsafe that they are able to contact somebody using their personal alert system that they have at home so there 's lots of little things to chat about in terms of falls but the main thing that i can stress is by adding in your strength exercises and your balance exercise into your week you will reduce your risk of falls and that is really really important so today we 're going to go through some balance exercises so all you will need is a chair or a wall close by which we 'll just use for support and again i will give you options on how to progress these exercises safely if you can do them supervised with someone around or family members if they come to visit do them together and also it is important that you do have some sort of challenge so with balance exercises it is recommended that you do them supervised by a health professional such as an exercise physiologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home we want to make sure they 're nice and safe because you 're by yourself but if you do have someone that you 're seeing for exercises give them to add in some balance and make sure they 're there to supervise and it is more beneficial if you are supervised as you get a bit more of a challenge and you can add in some things that will change it up okay so we need to challenge your balance to get better but making sure when you do them at home you do feel nice and safe and only do them if you 're comfortable okay if you have never done them before and you 're really unsure or if you have had a fall recently please make sure that you see clearance prior to completing your balance exercises we want to make sure that you 're nice and safe when doing so and that 's definitely the number one point okay now if you can let 's get into our balance exercises okay our first exercise that we 're going to do for our balance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heel toe balance and there are some different variations to make sure that you 're safe so i 'll first get you to look at my feet and what we 're going to do is we 're going to stand with our feet apart so if i was face on i 'll have one foot where it is the other one hit width apart with my heel at the same space as my toe so if i had my hands that would be like that okay we 're going to start with a space in the middle and if you can no holding on if you need to you would hold on to the chair now what you 'd like to aim for is 30 seconds each side so we aim to stand for 30 seconds once you 've done that 30 seconds you will swap so you 'll then put your left foot forward and your right foot back for the first option you have your feet hip width apart one foot forward and the heel of that foot is in line with the toes of your other foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left foot back my right foot forward and see how my toe is at the same position as my feel okay that is option one and what you would do is you would aim to do 30 seconds on one side swap 30 seconds on the other okay the next one is to bring them closer so now i would guess one footed hit with the other foot i will have next to my heel so now my heel and my toes are touching they 're not directly behind each other they are touching each other so my toes are in line with the middle of my foot okay side on my foot is here i 'm bringing this foot into the side of the foot so they are on okay again 30 seconds on this side i will try to balance i might need the wall i might need my fingertips or i might need to hold on to a chair all fine then i will swap other side third option which is the hardest is you are directly heel toe so my toe is touching my heel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you may need a wall next to you to hold on to to help you balance or again use your chair you would aim for 30 seconds doesn 't mean you 'll reach 30 but i might touch the wall three or four times great try and let go or try and just use your fingertips and keep going for the whole 30 seconds okay then i would swap so now my left foot is in front and my right foot is behind and again i 'm going to try and balance for 30 seconds okay so you 've got three options pick the one which you feel safest and try your best to aim to complete 30 seconds of your heel toe or tendon balance okay our next one is our heel toe walk so just like the previous exercise choose the width of your feet that feel most comfortable so the wider your feet are apart the more balance you will have the closer they are together the less stable you will be so pick which option works for you okay our exercise now is heel toe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are walking with our feet still hip width but we 're just looking at bringing our foot our heel sorry and our toe in position close to each other okay so we want to walk in position just like we had an option one in the other video where we 're standing still that 's the same position you place your feet to walk okay the hardest option is heel toe where you are walking and you 're placing your heel to your toe each step you take you bring your foot your heel goes to your toe just like you 're walking on a tightrope in the circus okay this one you really must do next to the wall because if you do go off balance you have got the wall where you can use it best place you can do this exercise is next to the kitchen bench or in between your hallway okay so we 'll do one more heel toe heel toe heel toe like you 're walking on a tightrope in the circus and make sure you have that wall there to help you balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back have a rest then do another one up and back and then see how you go so that one is heel toe walking balance or tandem walking all right guys our next exercise is our single leg balance now this one can be a bit intimidating for a lot of people but that 's why we always have our chair or our wall near us and we can use that for support so what i 'd like you to do is hold on to your chair for the first time lifting one of your legs up off the floor and standing there then what you would try and do is try your best to let go but still have the chair there for support or if not fingertips fingertips are on the chair try your best to let go and again you aim for 30 seconds so you won 't get 30 seconds straight away where you can just stand there for 30 seconds but i want you to keep going so i don 't care if you touch the chair 10 12 15 times or you just try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then you would swap okay if you 're at home you either pop the chair or you walk around on the other side now i 've got my left foot i 'm going to lift my right foot i 'm going to have my fingertip on the chair and i 'm going to try and balance i 'll try and take my hand off if i can i might get a bit wobbly hold on get stable go again your foot might also tap on the floor that 's also fine lift your foot again and again try your best to go for as long as you can for that 30 seconds and you try again okay and that is single leg balance now if you have stairs at home or a step our next exercise is called a step tap so it 's not just a step up we are simply tapping one foot on to the step bringing it down swapping bringing the other foot onto the step and bringing it down and this is a good dynamic balance exercise so you 'll stand behind your step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other foot on bring it off okay again do it next to a wall so if you do need support it is there so you tap up tap down swap tap down squat tap down i would recommend starting with 10 in total so 1 2 3 4 5 6 keep going eight nine ten having a rest and then going again so what you also want to aim to do is get your whole foot onto the step so try not to just get your um in front of your foot try and get your whole foot onto the step bring it off and then the other one as i said if you need to hold on to the wall or you need fingertips please do and then complete another set of ten let 's go another challenge you can add is having your head up and looking ahead as you do the exercise so only do that if you feel really confident and again you are standing next to that wall in case you need it okay two times ten of your step taps okay now after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds of step ups while we 're here so like i said adding in your strength and balance is really important also poor lower limb strength is a risk factor for your falls so it 's important to add these in so once you have done your step taps have a little rest and then i 'd like you to get into your step up so up with your right foot and your left down with your right down with your left and i 'll get you 10 if you can on each leg good that 's ten if you need to have a breather have a breather otherwise straight into your left up right up left down right down and let 's go 10. few more seven eight nine and ten okay so that is our step ups and again for safety completely next to the wall or next to a bench so if you do need to hold on to something you have got something there okay our next one is our sister stan i bet you probably thought i 'd left it out for this week but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right so pick your option as i 've said over the past weeks holding onto your chair using the bottom support or arms across your chest and we 're going to complete two lots of ten today okay again pick your speed and pick how many you can do by now we hopefully should be able to complete 10 in a row so let 's go pushing through your heels and standing up tall make sure you 're breathing that 's 10 sitting down again take that rest at least 30 seconds and then we do our second lot of 10. okay again choose whichever way you feel comfortable if you do have the weight like we did last week pop the weight on your chest as well or if you still need support please use it so pushing up and then if you need to use again to help you sit down also fine we 're doing ten this is three nearly there six two more nine and ten very good have a little breather okay guys another exercise that we have been doing over the previous weeks which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this standing or again we do have a seated option where you can lift your heels up as you sit down okay so what i 'd like you to do is sitting up nice and tall or standing nice and tall and lifting your heels going to do 10. you 're feeling that bottom part of your leg nine ten second round i 'm doing standing now again to add in a bit of a balance component that is where you try not to hold on so that 's where you can challenge yourself you can hold on with your fingertips let 's get started or you can try your best to do a few maybe without or maybe just trying not to and you need it to get back down absolutely fine but doing them without holding on gently also adds in our balance component to that exercise so both at once let 's do two more good job that one is your heel raise okay now the last exercise i would like you to add in is seated so have your feet planted on the floor again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift your toes up off the floor and then down again okay so i 'm lifting my toes up and then i 'm placing them down if it 's too hard or you might just have one foot better than the other you can also do them one at a time so you can lift your right foot up right foot down left foot up left foot down sometimes doing both at a time can be a little bit tricky so you can either do 10 in a row with your toes up which we 're going to start now good three more eight nine ten or if you need to like i said one at a time is also fine and still start with ten if it 's a bit tricky so you can go one two or you can keep going all the way till you 've done ten each side so let 's do another round of ten lifting our toes up now this is really important also for your ankle mobility which we will do our ankle circles in a minute but this helps to lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not want to trip or get our foot caught on the carpet or something on the floor so we need to be able to lift those feet off the floor three more and just to finish my favorite ankle circle so first option is heel on the floor and you can do your circles like that if you are able to lift your foot please do and do your ankle circles this way and then swap five the other way two three four five other foot if you need to heel that in front and do your circles on the floor still the same but to get even more ankle range of motion let 's go leg up three four five and then tricky back the other way two three four five all right well done with your balance exercises so i did add some little strength ones in there too so try your best to add these in for at least twice a week we 'd love you to do two hours worth of your strength and balance exercises combined and our main thing is we need @ @ @ @

Altona VIC 3018, Australia",3523,[Music] irony exercise exercise before a point just using a household item tonight in the Ottoman Empire with its gonna be hotel or two so now about exercises first exercises I 'm going to do it can be a short burst or so Chopra 's motion and then here of exercise just using the talent okay besides the tell it 's just easy it won the Cherokee the dismantling not to massive canary we do have a trip to tell from there what we do is the rest are with the chakras yeah it 's not very stress per se because the force of the chakras needs to be Hugh Barry wait for some upwards against it but what we 're doing is with the tower we 're going to maintain the tension so if your activation through the muscles that are something we used to do the chakras taking it out if you want to go up that 's one if not there 's always got a good group okay and another checking polity so eventually pulling the tower apart still set up again free to be a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a means to roughly measure across your collarbone wrists in line with others while the nizina switch mall that sells for the lower back stabilization all the tell apart so you start on issues you directly feel activation key muscles from there maintained you know Chris feeling the muscles work and what you gotta do for me in return it back down steel pulling the tail Bob they hold here roughly two to three seconds and then press again the idea really is what we 're aiming for is not the physical repetition even have attention to be replacing all the muscles so we go up and then coming back down starting over this desk our position I gave maintain the tension again boys trying to pull the tab now when you 've done the repetitions for that exercise still using the same towel one we can change taking this time what we 're going to do aerobics of stars okay you know make sure you can do a supported manner if you can 't do it you can do a minor mode into a line down but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies I mean again the emotion for sports see whether the dinner now if you tip or not that you can feel that your statement like I said I thought you might report taking them to hell again so we 're on a really cool cocktail in that position again you should feel also you 're back again but some people even just holding these for a few seconds could be enough from the occasion pulling apart you draw the tail toward you ideally amendment towards William L bunnies so maintain attention for a twenty to thirty four seconds whichever you want and then come back down again this is not about going like this with this exercise tension the reason for it was that the God 's intention that you must work throughout the sermon this is where the potato coming so as you 're going to talk about accordion in the back another way I think we 're doing is we always made interoperating she was a pretty sure I saw this waiting and then we returned back in the tension and then back down when you finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program of you so you go on that main thing is keep constant tension that 's the key one exercise I 'm going to show you is going to be more of a body weight exercise you can use something like bands for example I wouldn 't go using your resistance in a way of sticking the care through something on your back okay it 's a shot now he can 't do the push-ups guys don 't worry even if you just do that strong pressing as I showed you before that still would not throughout this is for those who want to be more work out but also want to feel that so that chest feeling or bit more taking in the triceps today okay I 'm not sure if you ice show you like on your knees first which is far away I 'm just starting out we want to rack this movement and then I 'll try a couple of reps on the guitars are all movements from the design but the undertakes we are first in line to be righteous like so for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to don 't squeeze the hands in finally you feel natural with you okay the shortest are carrying the hands alright so now we 've got our spot if you 're going to do any is what you 're gonna do from young is bring yourself up there in this organization with names you still want to feel that you 're making more something so not sitting back like this because what we want to avoid this this is not pushing out okay I 'm sorry [Music] if it 's a lot of emphasis on your shoulders so in that regard okay but it 's not working there 's exercise so we lean forward just as you need to and ideally you want to imagine your wrists elbows shoulders are sore in one arm forward in front of you behind you like this so run into a little spot yeah for me of something forward what I 'm going to do from here is I 'm going to try to squeeze my legs especially I can want to pollutes the whole lot then from there actually go to descend don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of forty forward slightly and then we return back up so notice that I come forward and then back up that 's how we want to move you know make sure we 're the squeeze and then press are some people I come into an IRA window and then press up either way it works too much for you now we 've come all the way over the top even if you saw the Randy shoulders at the top that 's okay when you come down you 're going to feel that your shoulders as well this way see that 's okay to the screen first camera so you do that few repetitions going to do a stops but it 's a practice the technique just look on the ribs and that 's fine as long as you can feel muscles already they are the types exactly the same setup except listen format don 't you can see beyond tired sir [Music] because the cool so again same thing I won you my hands and on my chest now when I go to shop with us about mitosis part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going on that but again same rules apply sweet words switch was falling the more as you go through the existence so mean but my squeeze what woods coming down okay does anyone know each other okay and exercise I like a pair up with the we should exercise inertia showing is a lack of grace or shoulder raises some people might know just this exercise of any use of pain you can teach other artists apart but just to demonstrate the exercise I just want you to be in for okay now we 're going to do here is we 're just going to do one arm at a time if you undo both the bottom see waste in each hand if you do go bad you can 't do it both again we 're just going to do this way across so opposite and I 'm holding it with my right hand from there we 're going to do is allow enough so as from here is going to be tension now what you can do from here is if you 're standing make sure you stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we still bounce at your feet so just a little bit but you still feel that or you will face till you find your way to shifting you 've got your power so I think before slightly okay the reason being is that there 's more interaction or it 's a bit of movement through the muscle that 's slightly forward of the latter rate as opposed to maybe stress in straight out as possible so just so you don 't mean okay I started playing myself you know if I were to ever be going with both there was not one time the younger one had time maintain again inside the stable as possible don 't be leaning back or they need into it okay the idea is is to really rush like this and come up as much as you can so as I slowly lean forward from there I 'm going to do is I 'm going to imagine their own power so push my arms my grandmother came they 're dropping on shoulder you know as I keep they smile they imagine if I 'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah oh three chickens roughly shrink and return back down I mean again imagine your own brush all the way up and then back down again rushing back now you can do physics associated as you can see in business to get make sure you come to each other but you can 't suddenly before but again if you are completely by this rather than something that won 't read of exercise machine you can do if you want Bowman 's we recently did electrical with that the Roberts on Majesty with attention he knows with the redouble pressing he 's working the interior and then we 're just working through three months [Music] again doing that so remember brush up all 40 seconds and then back down if you go to see long do repetitions in a row and then change to the other side occasionally in trees that 's what the but okay so we 've done four exercises I 'm never in town for this mother okay it 's a little bit longer able to see one we 're going to just do a couple of arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle area okay the reason about the longer tail is when we do tricep exercise you 'll see that we might need to extend the arms this one without the knees there 's one with the trusses or you can do both what you 're going to do here ideally in position that you can someone bring so what we 're going to do from here is when we hold the dalmatian contra grip if it helps we would so staple your no bio station see I 've been in the way of their Thursday their name falling behind your hip and from here what we 're going to [Music] okay game backwards and good teaching three hours okay before I leave the tell us that the money to readjust or on the town will hold roughly five maybe ten seconds and then relax trauma then he gave intense words just up bring attention and pull upwards okay you 're pulling through and people in Curitiba trying to those arms to the roof we feel the tension through the triceps when we finished again just right off that 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a bicep curl again this one can range emotionally it 's depend on your cow I 've seen something one one good this way where did take was if you are going to take off any of these towels an emotional see something a little right with attention and as long as you feel it was contracted you doing so many things this farm is roughly yeah without though I personally like the idea of who 's been there for me so if you want to again why don 't you you down three ways or it looks like now if you wanted to you go to the same time are focused in their way into Python see what do you want outlet okay we do it with one of trial of the way to lean into it hi Simone over the side body tank once race there we might have what I 'm going do from here is a former make sure maximum anything money library the length GDS well okay that 's all relax but the ammonium on creating tension up with and depend on the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a father you bring the towel up to the tension comes in the box you get really relaxed this and really attention one of the top four we have no tension bottom of the movement provided that it 's not as much pressure to figure out which one the key thing is again actual this is where you 're feeling the majority of squeeze now what you 'll do again use your stop down puts poisoning and from a pulling it outwards he 's no boy is much less how the body that a flaring forward so in other words a felon backwards and you don 't know where to go like so because it means the machine here on the shoulder oh yeah and lean backwards feel that teaching now given the right of the boss these warnings exposure to all muscle inside so from the modern holding and be first and it runs du t seconds Griffith setup I mean again only that 's great if you let muscle with you one day one up that way you can feel the heat down okay so it just had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks again the reason why the students write this one is again just to work on activation so you 're aware of your position it 's not being in or exercise however it is a handy start to Canadian don 't you want the way we 're doing today I 'm going to show you again similar to the brochure that I showed you on the knees and then I 'm going to show you on the fade as well so we 'll go through that you know remember these again be on the ground you gotta sit up pretty much exactly the same way to show yourself a little shopping and I 'll adjust and stand on the floor now with this what 's going to happen though exhibit hands with me we 're going to use the elbows so anything and from there I 'm just going to remind us yeah in my body just in terms of spacing as long as it 's rather short distance Hanks the granitic and then something some people they just make your clothes fit that 's okay too when we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to start the brush up on her knees but also everyone employed the same thing monkey up from all this exercise we want to feel tension through here so for some people that means you bring so hot we might not do anything straight light it maintain its lotta justment commonly from what amazed me somehow you go so same thoughts myself and Hans the fact that I sit back I and I get it Peyton sucks what however he 's still doing but very intention but if it 's too much too quickly then we we do in vs. so say myself up bring me some of my name 's know what I 'm doing here so forward enough okay but I 'm not seeing about these this is also a way to do it became a new visa sorry myself or enough the tension started human section you can celebrate your shoulders it 's okay alright because in some way we don 't you know we pushing their way into the ground so we want to keep personal and hoping and information matters call your attention try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with you hey imagine putting him back in a tiny teeny so it 's more of a neutral spine position once that 's whatever talk Frank completely when I was down and they think you guys first gram flour 20 seconds risk 20 seconds rest in Soho then do you allocate risk and without money on toys exactly the same thing we don 't be oh and also not too far for that you can 't hardly think you can collapse down we also don 't want this happening so on the toast set up in a way that you can still maintain that sort of feeling through that was straight feeling will never end stronger smugly and again mutual sparkly and then we haul for the alligator Tommy 's that 's if you 're gonna do it on your tires much more based on the TARDIS no need to rush in some ways obviously powerful activation so if at the Bible do anything is the greatest activation it 's enough for unity just keep doing until it 's like mega make it easy for you then eventually maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that freak you out okay so show that later on we 'll do other exercises that moment people forward balcony all that should have to be burgers talk to me okay guys I 've got the past of autumn together the ones about you I 'm initially are two labels and Oh magazine because if your exercise with fresh new minister jerec sauce goes for a while you know you know to go the reason that were just big days to respond a little bit of my household you can teach me cancer me like that that 's gone I just said kids everything the grains menu list they want your pretty really wide the rate it 's ok if you can can great with really white great because it does change the way the hustle play by integration for this is one but if you can add the best one is the to lay out the other benefit of using something over Toledo for ease you hold it one way to say from halfway holy and they will change the way it happens because the weights in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to use as long as it tries to again is a different feeling and exercise as well so anything you 're doing a bicep curl by changing the waiter can interact with your muscle the one thing our sales trial and that 's why don 't you tell of water or something else it was really funny because it 's not wrong it 's just that when you 're moving in a liquid moving around is to change the way so maybe one side was it 's not good as menacing yes for rehab yes but from a strength point of view is one build strength I just want to feel that you 've got more direction through your situation sorry you want stability so if they 're the more solid mastered by anything that just use much less movement mean young because that waiting about more interaction he must muscle westward through it okay on that make sure one screw don 't have the stick just the amount of describe basis in example as long as you 've got something that you can grip pretty well okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one make sure you 've got good strong grip safety as well as a so this one is there on that though at the same time if you find that you can use anything else go for it see how you go let me know how you go with that hopefully be some other ideas to try at home it 's not limited to just these exercises you can try other theories other videos out there if you want to gather so we learned if you 're not easy to comes on on that also if you have made my homemade resistance bands you always going to be here as well if not I 'll see you in the next video guys okay,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",3262,[Music] hi everybody my name is Cara and I we exercise physiologist working with Hobson 's Bay and today we 're talking about the importance of strength training so in addition to our roping exercise and all the movement we 've been doing throughout our day what we need to know how to talk about adding in is strength training the physical activity guidelines state that we should be aiming to do muscle strengthening exercise for a minimum twice a week ok now this includes roughly 8 to 10 exercises we were aiming to improve our large muscle groups and we 're aiming to improve our strength now strength training for some people can be quite a scary idea strength training can be associated with really heavy weight in the thought of going to a gym and that for some people can be quite scary and that can be sometimes what people don 't do it but what we 're going to talk about today is ways that we can include strength training at home safely and how easy is to add any hour to sessions per week okay so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main benefits is improving our muscle strength okay by improving our muscle strength it 's also helps with our joint health and also helps to protect our joints so some of us might have sore needs and the saw heaps sore sore shoulders if you get correctly prescribed exercises for these we can help to strengthen the muscles around the joint which will help with their management of your condition strength training can also help to reduce your risk of osteoporosis and also reduce your risk of Falls so by getting nice and strong and doing our strength exercises we can reduce our risk of Falls which is really really important ok another benefit is the management of our type 2 diabetes so strength training helps to improve our insulin sensitivity so this is really important as well if we do have type 2 diabetes so we are adding a strength training into our week now strength training can have a big range of exercises and they can include lots of different things so the first one can be body weight which is exercises that we have been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands that you can use they can include dumbbells or barbells and they can also include machine weights which you might find in a gym or when you visit health professional so a big big range and that 's why it 's really important that when you do get started if you are unsure or you haven 't completed strict training in a very long time or maybe never it 's important to get help from a health professional or an exercise physiologist to get started so it 's really important to have strength training has many variables so that it 's different sets which means groups of how many you 'll do different repetitions so how much do i do do I do five do I do six do I do ten how many do I do there 's intensity so how much weight should I be lifting and then again the frequency so how often should I be doing these exercises ready to me every step in that age should I do them daily what 's the amount that should be doing so there 's lots of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a simple lot of exercises that you can do at home but again please only do they make you feel safe I will give examples of some seven and it will give some examples of standing depending on how you feel but as I said if you haven 't exercised before it is really good to get some help similarily if you have different health conditions and you need help with managing certain pain areas it 's really important that you get help with that so that we don 't exacerbate any pain by doing our exercises so many benefits of strength training the best ones are to keep us nice and strong so we can continue we 've had two other activities whether that be picking up a box out of the Covenant and being able to put down being able to lift our groceries out the car and carry the mean just simple tasks at home can be made a lot easier by improving our strength and secondly reducing our risk of fall so that 's really really important and strength training has been proven to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to be using a chair for some exercises I 've also got a step and I 've got some light dumbbells if you don 't have any of those at home that 's also fine and we 'll give you other alternatives instead of dumbbells you can use water bottles you can use cancer through that you 've got a poem you can use something filled with flour or sand or whatever you might have that just add some resistance they can be really helpful to build some muscle so just see how you go today all right guys if you have watched the last few videos you will know exactly what my first exercise for a strict training will be and that you guys see the stand so my favorite exercise helped build our leg strength and we 're also functional together get out of bed get out of the car and just do things that we need to do throughout our day sorry again I 'm going through some variations we have if you 've got handles on your chin you can use that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your upper body to lift yourself up hand under the chair to help you lift up and then down arms across your chest coming up and then down and then today if you have any weights today I 've got to dump out but if you 've got a water bottle or a bag of flour or any you might have at home holding onto that and planes yet on your chest so I 'd actually like you to put it on T chest I don 't want you to hold it out and once you have it onto your chest and hugging it tight okay so you 're gonna keep that there whatever you 've got or if not whatever variation in life and we 're going to start today with ten reps so pushing three heels standing nice and tall and then sitting back there try mrs. dam is tolling hen that 's five you need a rest at 00 please feel free have a rest today we 're going to do ten that 's eight nine and ten and then we rest okay so I usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a second option now we 're gonna strength exercises today I would like you to rest in between assets for 30 seconds minimum okay that sound my soul 's relaxed and have a bit of a rest and then we 're gonna get up and we 're gonna go again and we 're gonna start now so peak your option I 'm going arms across we 're going to do ten reps I said you can eat yourself a five that is absolutely fine if you need to stop at six also fine just do what you need to do and same thing we give speed so I always try and say one two up one two down but if you need to go slower that is also fine good job is meaty hands help you up also fine and rest very good okay guys a second exercise in the bicep curl so I have got my weights again now if you have anything at home we can use two water bottles you can use two quarter bottles you can use whatever birth-name our first option is seated so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy it 's just that I 'm not slacking and I like to sit tall and I 'd like you to pop your weights by your side okay you will then curl your arms up bring the weights you showed up and then bring the weights back down towards the side of your keep okay what we don 't want to do is use our body to help us we want to try and you know our muscles so try your best to stand tall bring the weight up and bring the weight down now we can do this with bands as well so if you do have a band at home you can do that too oh you can don 't want to use the weights and you feel like the movement is just enough you can have your hands out tap your fingers to shoulder and then down again okay we 're going to start with ten reps today so let 's go bring up to my shoulder and then down triad miss to extend your arm as straight as you can as well seven two more nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the other exercise 30 second drapes before we start again the next one I 'll do is the same exercise but in standing okay so standing up have your feet nice and wide always good to have a nice and wide to have a good base of balanced arms by your side again staying nice and straight let 's bring the waist up and then down we 're going to do 10 again see if you need to do it seated absolutely fine you stay seated but if you can 't stand and do it even better I good job nearly there done and then sitting down to have a rest before your next exercise our next fun guys is our car phrase also known as hero raise and something that we have been doing over the past week so what I 'd like you to do is have your feet underneath your hip width apart so making sure they 're not close together for their underneath your hips and if you hold on please do if you heels up and then coming down one second up and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to hold on you don 't need to but start now we 're going to do ten reps more 9 and 10 you suck feel your lower legs warming up now if you would like a challenge now only drew this if you are able to do a few rays without holding on ok what you can do to make a little bit highlight is grab your dumbbells or your water bottles whatever you 've got and completely erase while you 're holding your dumbbells ok so same thing if you do have a chair do it near that just in case but holding your dumbbells by your side and lifting your heels up okay so 10 reps whichever variation if you need to hold on you hold on if you don 't want to use the weights you don 't use your weights okay going you 've got five more you 've got the weight hmmm nice and by your side lifting the heels up three two and one good job okay guys our next exercise is a shoulder press now you can do this either seated or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip width making sure that you 're nice and comfortable in your stance but what like it is always first is not anyway so all of us can have some tight shoulders and we do have trouble lifting your arms above our head so first time you do this exercise please sit with that weight have your arms up above in a feast so pretending you 're holding on to something and punch both arms up to the roof and then down okay if that 's too high you can always try one arm at a time but today we go this up with 10 reps and I want you to start the first round with no weight okay let 's go up and then down push up and then good job if this is too uncomfortable don 't do it or if you can only do small ones that way school month that 's fine it 's good to get our shoulders moving this is called a shoulder press pressing up to the sky okay have a rest I 'm going to grab my weights now if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilo or a kilo if you have waiting room or a water well again use what you 've got and just see how you feel so I will do this rating standing so again like I said feet nice and wide arms at your shoulders and push up and then down push up and then down okay same as seated let sit sided weed ten reps and I 'll switch between the two that 's three make sure you 're breathing breathe pass on your way up breathe out breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out breathe in one more breathe out breathe in okay and same thing do whatever pace you feel come with but that one today is called the shoulder press so give that one to go all right guys the next one is another one of my favorites and it 's called a wall pushup so some of you the past may have done floor push-ups you might go on your toes you might put them on your knees but at the moment mine will be table just purely because we might find a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really really tough because we have another strength just yet so I 'll recommend everybody for your first session to make sure that you try and push up with the wall okay and this exercise we will have to face away from you to use the wall so we 'll explain at first so what you like to start with is your arm position okay you want to make sure that your fingertips all right shoulder height so that 's where you 'd like to start I always recommend with starting your width at your shoulder tweak as well so you don 't be too wide on be too narrow start at shoulder width and start shoulder height okay again have you feet nice and comfortably wide and what you 'd like to do is stand about your arms week away from the wall to start with and you want to bring your nose in towards a wall while it keep your body straight so what we don 't want is you just to be using the top I want to make sure we use that whole body and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring your nose towards the wall straighten the arms out and push yourself up okay so let 's have a look like I said you look I 'm gonna see my back but let 's see how we go so my hands are at shoulder height my width of my hands is that shoulder weak I 'm standing away from the wall I bend my elbows bring my nose to the wall and I come bring my nose through wall and come back out en will do ten good Remo nine and then a ten okay so we then will have a 30-second rest again and then we 'll see how we go now what I 'd like you to think about is your foot position so if that was easy you can always take your feet further away and if you do need to go on your tippy toes that 's also fine but in terms of safety I would recommend you start with just your arms with and see how you go with hands in and hands out okay if you do too like a challenge and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them off the kitchen bench but just make sure that you are supervised if you 're doing so okay so I 'm shorter height and shot a week we 've got a feet plan on the floor if you wanting on your tippy toes and stand further away and do it all soak in but let 's just start with today to up to 10 nice and safe if your body nice and stride Jumma nine and ten okay so that one there is your walk push up alright guys our next exercise is our step up so if you have a step at home great or if you 've got stairs also use them I would recommend to start with and place your step next to the wall so that if you need to you can hold on or you can place your fingertips on the wall put some added support so we 're gonna start with step it up with our left foot onto the step and then bring up our right foot coming back down with our left foot and then alright so just see left up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right leg goes up first and follow down left and then our right foot goes down so good for the brain as well okay right leg up for one right leg down first right leg up right leg down three and five okay have a little breather again try your best for about 30 seconds have a rest second round if you are confident I 'm going to grab my dumbbells so holding them by my side while I do the step ups now again I only feel safe and also only if you have the balance to do so use the dumbbells otherwise use more support to start with or just completely with your side so I 'm holding my Jumbo 's by my side I 'm signing with my link light up let 's do 5 reps left leg up left leg down 3 4 5 then I go rock it up left leg up right leg down ok 4 5 rightly 3 ok so start with that that 's two out of five on each leg if you felt like that was easy next time you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how you go well done guys try those strength exercises today at high room again only do them if you feel safe and start with two lots of 10 if you 're feeling confident you can always progress or again seek some help and guidance for some throw that exercises give them a go and I will see you next week,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

how 're you going you can lean how are young good things are you I 'm pretty good so thanks for catching up with me today it 's really appreciated how I you you 're in the middle of studying at the moment yeah I 'm going to bed I 'm just trying to get through these couples assignments that I have for uni but from that I 'm doing all right as good as you can be in this time well that 's great and house it has things been with the pandemic I guess and having to stay home how has that been affecting you I mean it definitely is like it 's an unprecedented time you know a couple months ago you would have imagined that offering a hug or a handshake will no longer be the polite way to greet someone yeah they 're definitely just trying to keep my distance my physical distance I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grocery store you know crossing the street you see someone else you know the most polite thing the most considerate things he can do now he was to try to try and move to the other side but yeah pop from that he 's been around good yeah I think we 're seeing a lot of new variations of handshakes coming out here almost touching kicking toes together and things like that it 's yeah quite quite an interesting time for everybody I imagine your routines probably changed a fair bit as well yeah hun person is extremely difficult at first of my life my first is definitely higher because you know I just like working out and going to gym so using the gym and the local basketball courts just down there and Brooklyn and the soccer season being postponed and you know moving online so you can 't really like interact with new people I 'm especially just starting my first year and it was definitely difficult at first but you also understand you know wide such measures were put into place so you can 't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I exercise the way of study and my mother has always told me that it 's through adversity that we are able to grow so you know I don 't have to like restrictions that we have and you know no one has to enjoy self isolating but you have to believe in it and the role it plays in keeping us safe and and and using that storm of energy into a true source or trap of strength and I always believe that it 's the learning that comes from the adversity that creates the biggest opportunity for growth and that 's what I 'm trying to approach this whole situation with yeah yeah that 's right and I think we 've all been learning to adapt you know and we 've been forced to adapt very quickly and think of new ways to do things so there 'll be some positives that comes out of this at the other end I think I guess probably as another significant component of the objective coronaviruses around the mental health of some people who probably do struggle with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or experiencing amongst say your colleagues and you know young younger people around how they 're managing or dealing with mental health yes I can see that it 's clearly high especially at the start it was definitely difficult for them and and that 's very understandable are you understand why that 's happening you know young people are rapidly adjusting to learning and socializing remotely no spending more time with the family and sacrificing comfort and convenience for the greater good and so it is definitely it 's definitely must be hard for them and from what I 've seen you know young people 's days I 've sort of sort of blurred into Google classroom assignments Hobby seeking you know searching aimlessly or Netflix and on exceptionally boring day is another they often you know existential contemplation and I think that the dichotomy of freedom and from school and yet the sort of mixed feelings helplessness and loneliness how sort of plague the time on home because a lot of young people love to interact like I was like you said my in love to interact with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jerk around and being at home alone and almost very difficult for them I had a friend of mine tell me that schoolwork seems increasingly pointless at this point because a lot of the exams and assignments have been postponed or cancelled so even learning now becomes sort of like a challenge for them yeah so this like this is here in the situation you know inevitably affect young people 's mental health because as you can imagine you know young people love to be challenged and love to push forward and push the boundaries and with no or sensible end in sight at least you know before the restrictions are lifted it 's mostly truly hard for them yeah yep I can understand your and people used to being outdoors more often they probably don 't even really appreciate how little amount of time they spend inside or at home until it 's taken away from you so yeah it 's been very challenging time if I guess if you had any your a message that you wanted to send out to people who who might watch this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people and how they kind of keep their tune up during this time I guess the main thing to remember is that if you don 't feel up to anything that 's okay too because like we said it 's such an unprecedented time like you could not have imagined this a couple of years ago or even a couple months ago instead of the year you can imagine and this isn 't and we 're all trying to cope with this as best as we can and being kind to yourself and to other people I think is the most important thing right now and everyone is different and will have different ways and different things to help them get through this in order to also remember we 're here as a community we 're here together we work not just for ourselves but we for each other to overcome this and and so if you find yourself struggling at any point because we are going to struggle at some point because our routines have all changed so if you found it so struggling at any point there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't fill any sort of way you know reach out someone is gonna be there for you and you lose together people don 't need to feel like they have to battle it out on their own yep so yes certainly I think a lot of the support that that we 're seeing people here collecting through donations and reaching out for each other on a range of different levels it 's been amazing so thank you very much for your words and support as well it 's really appreciated and thank you for taking the time to chat with me today that 's alright thank you very much thank you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

Altona VIC 3018, Australia",4573,just like the Empire guys I 'm striking back it 's dead again so you can call me the man if you want that falling over though today we 're going to look at the idea of staying active at home okay with everything going on with isolation check in with all your mates checking if your friends checking family give them a call give them a text give them a Facebook it doesn 't matter send something to them that way they know you 're thinking about them or on because this whole isolation stuff is in fact at us so much greatly so of us not so much so let 's just make sure we all look out for each other or thinking of age other okay let 's take over each other today we 're doing the activities at home we 're going to look at a couple of exercises we 're going to do some stretching or some mobility work if your particular some work at home yes situation and then the other side of it on the other look at some interval based trade that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other thing is I want you to I check out is if you already haven 't seen it already important Bible research check out powers video she has some great ideas there as well so have a look over that it also might be a good way to start it could be something introduced so add in as well but I have a look at her videos all right now going on to actually an active home a lot of you probably seen them online the very similar the online programming going around this program a lot of challenges of Nosa popped up so for example of 30-day shoulders from people with a ways of they 're sharing something around which is fine alright that 's totally cool however the one thing I 've stressed about that is don 't feel that that 's exactly what you have to do or I keep in mind exercise in itself is always going to be best for what is good for you if you like that idea of doing a video challenge we you want to say hey I wanna see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it however the one thing I would assume the stress is make sure it 's do some research on the techmakers you can ask questions find out some other videos but have different videos of different people 's versions of how they do the exercise okay it doesn 't mean that the person who does the one the one video means it 's completely correct okay but also you might find that you might do the exercise in a certain way because of your mobility or whatever so you might need to basically the same okay you 're doing push-up challenge you probably can 't do you may not be able to do push-ups on your feet so you might need to look up and how to do it on your knees but by that you can just go for it violence you might be doing anything correctly which could be damaging for you down the track but on that you want to find someone who 's teaches it in a good way saying hey push up on these this is a good way of doing it so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is if you 're not motivated to do challenges and stuff okay totally fine just make sure you 're doing something that you 're happy doing that you enjoy doing and that is somewhat it 's feasible so I mean by that is that if you 're going to schedule with the end so right every Monday I 'll do this then make sure you 're consistent with that don 't say Monday oh I 've been through a slow you might do a bit more then you saw a guy in two days afterwards try and make sure it 's something that you can do consistently okay it doesn 't have to be hard and fast straightaway alright you can build up to it evening blogger superb or something okay now on that again safety first make sure anything we do today in terms of exercise or something you could handle if you 're not sure by all means don 't hesitate to try get in touch with myself Cara okay or there 's another professional through that you might know have a chat to them alright anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor you know seek medical advice if something goes for really Australian I guess you got me in your easier if not that make sure you contact physio sclerosis on whatever name or I 'm so safe in the first person four months alright alright so on that we 're gonna get into you stay active that harder so we 're gonna do today these were guys we 're gonna do become the quads we 're gonna do a little bit of the chest and shoulders all the bits go together in a way a little bit the back okay some of the back and then from there we 're also going to do forums particularly if you 're doing well it 's hiking or you find that you 're just chilled and you saw a lot of theses pronated internal rotation position which we find we do a lot driving the car computer in dinner a lot of the time we are in this hand position there which in turn a lot of the muscles that are assisting this even up in the chest I 'm just constantly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just go okay that 's how we function so for the first researchers or the first one I 'm going to do is the quad one okay you can use the chair as a base if you need to just pop on the side all right so that way what they 're the easiest one that we can do is and it 's easier sickness IKEA easy take grandma food you know you can 't do that don 't worry what you can do here you pop your foot up on the desk just bear in mind if you do it this way make sure you balance okay and you 've gone allow your foot to give it a little bit of wiggle room all right so if you 're gonna go that far that 's okay because then what you do is you simply just drop yourself down into the stretch hoping there 'd be something but you might find at that height you 're already stretching anyway you always have someone helping you alright if you need someone help yeah just make sure that I grab a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing two things you know get your balance officer grab when you grab this with one hundred years with this hand with it what is you going to pull that upwards as if you 're pointing it towards your back of Trumpets basically shorter and at the same time what you 're trying to do is what you 're doing that you 're going to imagine that you sort of clean you 're trying to bring the knee back behind you okay so you can see I 'll try to do it like this but as you 're doing that you but then try and drive the leg forward at the same time so in other words while your knee is getting pulled back that way you 're trying to force him to keep it pointing to the ground so as you pull back you 're trying to drive the knee so that way you can still feel or look that 's pointed floor as you 're pulling back here that internal prayer the stretcher alright now when you do this hold it for a few seconds and then relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding that the the original concept was hold the stretch and hold it for a while all right where it came from I can tell you right now know about their finding that it seems to be better for us as a whole from restriction point view that yes if you 're going to stretch for a minute certainly stretch for a minute but break that minute up so what I mean that is do it free lots of 20 seconds so all for 20 seconds relax it down take it again alternate 20 and relax again you 've still got a complete minute of stretching because that 's what you want to do but they finding that in that sporadic time Oh stretching the body goes oh yeah they don 't know we want to stretch so we will be a we will allow ourselves to stretch whereas they found that by doing this and holding it or so long yeah you probably get a similar result but they also found that what you 're creating here is a hyper extension okay or over stretch is something more support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan it was also promoting or creating weakness which is the bad thing remember a muscles of design and the ways that stabilize our bones so no muscles with or Nepal abides doesn 't matter about any other organs we need the muscles and we 're both they need that tension once before my pushing and they hold the joint in all right too much of one way for example to type not good but then it also is going to loose not go either so you want to be that you can still have some form of mobility okay but at the same time don 't a person in there and being one minute and then flying I mean it doesn 't sort of doing or solving two minutes you might mean that you might just need to do is stretch it a bit differently or you might need to upgrade the stretch to something else like for example that could be a very similar stretch but then you might do it where you then lie down on the floor and therefore you create more of an angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used because you can 't still want to keep that muscle someone activated you do it okay that 's the quad on either leg alright then the next one we 're going to do is the chest and shoulders they cannot do on the side okay this is just a little easy to see we 're gonna principle thanks alright you put them behind your back those have done time and money back then we 're going to do from here is this your but I 'm gonna aim to squeeze your shoulder blades together a bit alright now I 'm going to do that what helps is as you 're squeezing your legs with your chest up we 're going to try and push it forward the chest goes that way shoulder blades squeezing is if you 're throwing your short place the pinch of spine alright to try so so right I 'm going to try and grab that 's why I 'm so late but I 'm also pushing which is forward the reason for that is as you can see if I do it that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay but from there as I 've got back from the hands I 'm also stretching through my chest and I 'm mostly going through my shoulders as well a little bit alright and the reason things might do that is because we wanted to want to open up the chest a bit more because one thing that gets really commonly tied all the time when it comes to a lot of this is that being not so much a major more of your PEC minor and also they finally disarray the muscle that somewhat related to your core you get really tired and as a result it 's almost like saying there 's a hand here okay and it 's you that 's doing this and you won 't notice it but sometimes it 's really prevalent in a lot of people who do weight training and just say they 're doing nothing but I wanted to go like dead lifting for example a lot of time after Wilding fine they look somewhat the real of like because they 're being constantly de nothing with the benching and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat all right now this is not a cure all right but it 's just handy for the disc work because what you want to do is every five minutes or eight minutes go there squeeze your legs in push the chest boy a few seconds loves now the other thing you can do it c- routine when you take the breath in don 't breathe Enki chest we won 't breathing the develop all right into the belly is the best father we want to breathe engine not into the chest into the chest is actually more linked to your fight or flight syndrome so you know I mean you sort of like deciding okay I 'm gonna have to you know fight here when I 'm gonna run away a lot of the time I go into the chest and that 's sort of trace the body to go hang on why we why we misty we weren 't trying for the belly so you need to practice on me and on the belly breathing in trunk really into your hands now you don 't have to swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you 're breathing and this is a serve relaxation breathing as well if you like you feel like that anxiety knowing or something like that do some of that if you don 't put your hands in you better that 's fine I mean you can imagine like if you hold it straight up so I don 't you 're like really like I do what are you doing or something might be like hey I know that Celica but what you 're doing them on the back all right kisses up but then we try breathing them early as much as you can and then as you exhale where he 's back more so you can use that breathing technique to help so you can get more of a stretch all right same thing applies do it in bursts start with a minute interval but then try and Sue Adams if you do and you say to lots of these seconds or see what happens we do three lots of 20 seconds all right done in 10 seconds or so like that something silly original yeah if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forearms again and straight out from you so try and keep on the straight spots with OB and that this is one way of doing it this will stretch more of this part of your forearm okay when your hands down will stretch more of the car before so grab that grab the fingers pull back alright as you pull back where you should feel the stretch or the feeling should come through this part of your round okay if you find you 're getting your hold something like that I 'm not so completely incorrect it 's just that it might be something else going on that 's telling you hang on we 're not the right position or we might have something else happening okay you might find out with iPhone with summer clients is that they can serve like me if you can see here doing that someone might have to turn the arm more outwards so what they 're doing is essentially trying to achieve this so when they do it you might find you need to turn I wouldn 't say you need to internally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's more about turning out okay yeah doing outwards it 's not going to be an extreme 180 all right so don 't try and flip the arm it could be a very minor tweak and then also you 've got the stretch so maybe we 'll you see that build against the wall without put the hand in the wall and what you do is you push were you leaning into a bit that 's not the way you 're doing it if you have wrist issues or injuries or anything like that please if you don 't try it do it very cautiously and safely okay if it 's not for you there 's other ways we can sort of treat the forms and stuff but you do the ability to work with massage everything like that okay so we will explore that in a few more weeks because I 'll be doing might be able to mobility video with all sorts of little gadgets and the other one hands down I 'm kind of same thing alright this time when you 're doing is grabbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to use the wall you can do so make sure it 's safe in addition all right now again you might find a job to tweak it a little bit so give yourself at my return yeah but from there just until you get that stretch all over again and like then go again you bite with this one in particular you 're not gonna disappoint me but your thing isn 't you can touch the up okay it 's never going to be like that but what you 're trying to do is it just encourage that muscle to understand that we are meant to have some sort of tension to flexibility happening here we 're not completely tensed all right but not completely relaxed so that 's what we 're aiming over those ones yeah and I 'm focusing on the idea because we 're Sentara like this a lot alright so what you can do you I wouldn 't do it standing all right so what you do is you pop yourself down like this right and what you do from here is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop forward behind the spikes it might take a little bit to intro to find where you come forward so Hollinger okay and what you 're going to do is to drop yourself down and let yourself drop drop drop come on yeah I feel pretty sick I needed to be on camera here so drop yourself down and you feel like you even might feel that you know the chest and shoulder skin okay probably similar what we do them a full pot what happens is if you then now get down that position drop yourself back a little bit it 's a seat you bump back to you they you 'll find that you get a little more into the back area okay and if you want very very slight rotation okay and that can help as well when you come back up send yourself up come forward first then slowly bring yourself back up alright again with that one you can use the breathing technique 20 seconds at a time slowly do it again you 're not gonna get to the point where you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging bad mobility happening here particularly again because they 're so stuck in this position those are some of the stretches that we 're going to use at the moment all right again I 'm going to do a mobility video hoping the next couple of weeks well could show some other stuff to do that you can do while you 're doing your office work all right but when that comes around you 'll see there 'll be some awesome stuff there alright so for now there 's the stretches quickly going through the stretching routine now the other thing I was going to mention is some people might find stay of doing what while doing it also during the day of work or why they work at home you might find that a morning routine could be something to do as well or practice or some people might do a little bit of a couple of yoga exercises when they wake up some people might do some of the stretches I 'm showing you today okay they find that doing these little exercises prior to or just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything like that these though it 's very handy to help get the body a more alert wake up better rather than like a shot away with caffeine or something like that so that might be something to look at one particular person that I would suggest over check out is a Bible Kelly story okay he also had at the book how to be a supple with the leopard I believe he 's a chiropractor along with a few other qualifications he has a YouTube channel which is called the ready state check out these videos there 's a lot of mobility a lot of stretching stuff on there he 's a very knowledgeable guy some a really short sharp ones some of them you might find there hey that really applies to me right now so give him a look if not if you 're a Reno you can always get the book I guess but you know what we 're going to do is we move on to with those you want so we get the heart rate up then when you get active at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes or so we 're gonna look at some interval training I 'm gonna give you an example of some of the Tabata exercises I 've got my Tommy here I had some of you guys are technicians and classes you 'll know about my timer very famous I like using this particular timer it 's a gym boss timer the reason I like using this one is I can program things I want haven 't won any rounds I want toggle alarm goes on you want to exercise the point anytime you do any exercise you want to move yourself to the point where you can get to know me the face or nine out of 10 and let 's see never go to 19 all right the way I described going 10 our team is on game day alright so if you play sport that 's what you go to any other thing but when you 're training the max we go with eight or nine and because you 're still very small thank because you need a recovery support if you flop yourself position or some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get catch up to get yourself back up to up they 'd stand it so when you go back to the next workout you can hit that and they go up another level so pick an exercise like I said it 's a bonus what just for the moment for anybody so the way other words ten seconds you know wait 10 seconds and then from there when the timer goes off it 's going to tell me to stop now sometimes doing squats set myself up also for the next 20 seconds I 'm constantly doing the movement all right so we 're up and down for the 24 this doesn 't go for too long other than 20 seconds and listen program 432 having trouble and then for me what will happen is it 's very very stop ten seconds yeah the tumble go up again and that 's when I start again then we keep repeating well so that 's when I 'll do another 20 seconds 10 seconds race 2010 so why do I eat the egg rounds that 's it that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this at home eat you can use a skipping work so I have 10 days rest it 's my second skinny if you want to do on the exercise block if you 've got one at home or if you 've got one if you go ahead and cycle do that fine now if you don 't want to do it in a timing sense all right what I 've seen some people deal with some ideas are out there is there something that 's jogging go alone use a house use the block use the house block go right every okay two houses chill one house I run within the next two next one I run if you want do it that way that 's why from a boxing point of view like much do you guys some of you guys have done with me and you 're doing in pace you resting 10 seconds 20 seconds simple all right I might complicate just straight straight straight rest 10 seconds things like that okay that one will bring up the hard way hardly heart rate it makes it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would suggest is working with the idea of something up body first do that and do something lower body okay trying to double it up okay so the in the water if you do drawing up double if you 're going you know one way of also doing it is you do a couple of rounds and then go for your walk if you want to do that as well all right I find that actually very beneficial do a bit of interval training and then go off and do some steady-state stuff so you can go for a walk or a casual bike ride have according whatever okay but that is one way that we can do some high intensity stuff at home without needing a lot of equipment you can do a lot of body weight okay now I have some exercises for you guys I have some ideas where you can sort pick and choose some exercises to pair up all right I 've they 're all written down,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

AUS,VIC,Hobsons Bay City Council,Hobsons Bay City Council,https://www.youtube.com/c/HobsonsbayVicGovAu,Hobsons Bay Movement in Isolation week 3 with Kara,jQki7XJ75ps,20200522,1063.91,"115 Civic Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",2870,[Music] hi everybody my name is Cara I own the exercise physiologist for Hobson 's Bay and today we 're talking about aerobic fitness what it is and some benefits of why would you do it so firstly what is aerobic exercise the easiest way to explain it in a consistent movement over time using large muscle groups and each of you prove a fitness Sophina such as walking when we 're using large muscle groups and we 're aiming to improve our fitness through that movement okay there are a lot of different names for it you might be people saying I 've got I 'm going to do tomorrow exercise I 'm going to do my kite vascular exercise I 'm gonna go do some cardio all those types of things all mean the same it just means we 're aiming to improve our fitness and in general aiming to improve our heart health by doing that and our general functioning of the body so there 's many benefits of Keio exercise and the main one is increasing our heart health so I 've had this in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it needs to be worked to make sure that it gets stronger so just like we do our strength exercises to get our muscles nice and strong that is what every exercise does for our heart so make sure it 's nice and strong metro blood is pumping throughout the body and just working nice okay there are lots of benefits so the main benefit is keeping our blood vessels nice and healthy so this will help to manage our blood pressure it also helps to make sure we have good cholesterol and reduce some of the bad cholesterol as well other benefits include prevention of the type 2 diabetes similarly if you have been diagnosed with Type 2 derbies it also helps to manage your condition aerobic exercise is also beneficial to help with your weight management whether that be weight loss sort of could be managing your weight and preventing further health decline as well also the main benefit of aerobic exercise is it includes our overall fitness and overall ability to do tasks so things at home becoming yeah walking places become easier because our body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency becomes better so we can just move easier so there 's many benefits of aerobic exercise so it 's a good one we need to add into our week now the Australian physical activity guidelines state that for moderate exercise we should be doing approximately 150 minutes per week or vigorous exercise 75 minutes or a combination of both now the difference between moderate and vigorous will be completely different for everybody so it 's based on your intensity of your exercise it 's also based on your fitness so you might be on a moderate intensity doing maybe treatment walk for someone else who 's doing it and lower intensity for 20 minutes could be on a completely different speed completely different duration as well so making sure when you are doing your OB exercise you 're doing it for you knowing where to start and knowing me field so some examples of a moderate exercise could be walking cycling or a light swim again depending on how your fitness level is vigorous exercise and foods things like heart cycling running skipping really getting that heart rate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can determine if you 're in the moderate or vigorous is sometimes using your heart rate but that can be sometimes hard to calculate and depending on your health that 's the easiest way I say is hold your conversations so if you 're going for a war with someone and you can hold a conversation you know you 're in a moderate intensity okay if you are saying to break up a conversation you may not be able to finish the conversation or you may not be out have one at all and you focus on your breathing that means you 're probably entering the vigorous range now in saying that please make sure you feel safe and that the breathlessness isn 't isn 't as far as a sign that you 're not feeling too well so if you do feel any discomfort when you start exercising or during your exercise such as intense breathlessness or sweating or hot flashes or you 're just feeling a bit off please make sure that you do stop exercising and see medical attention where necessary okay same thing if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you never have or you have a new condition that 's just been diagnosed in your unsure please speak to GP prior to starting a new program or again see an exercise physiologist or an allied health professional to get you started on a safe and progressive program so just because I 've said today the guidelines say you must do 150 minutes of moderate or 75 a vigorous doesn 't mean if you go to run for 75 minutes next week that isn 't not the point the point is you want to start nice and gradual and again pick something you enjoy so just because I 've said vigorous and one of the exams was running does not mean you have to do running okay running isn 't for everyone it 's not a thing that we have to do but some people have that as a goal so cool if your goal is to be on a run down the street fine start with a 30-second interval and two minutes rest and you keep building up but again seek advice if you need it and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know at the moment you can only walk for five minutes then you just stick to your walking and you aim to increase your moderate intensity exercise so just stick to where you 're at and see how you go as I said there 's many benefits of aerobic exercise the main thing is a heart health and making sure everything is working nicely so yeah if you have any questions please feel free to ask me or again ask a health professional that you know of before you start exercising today we will be doing a little bit more movement so I will give you some seated and standing options or you will need today is a chair so yeah we 're gonna get moving a bit more today and see how our heart rate goes if you do want to complete the exercise as a bit last week please go and see in the video they 're a bit more acid entry and a bit more strength based today we 're going to get reading so just grab a chair press pause and start our exercises now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the spot so making sure we are getting warmed up now what I haven 't given you a few weeks is a seed adoption so we can do this exercise exactly the same when sitting down okay so you can start with your feet your arms just the same as you are standing up so let 's go ten more if you a 10-second break it up and then I 'm gonna get back up to standing so as I said the other way if you can hold on if he nature you but let 's try our best to move those legs let 's go alright next exercise I 'm going to give you a few options so again if you have a chair please feel free to use it where you would do your side steps holding on to the chair so going from one side feet together and then yeah okay I 'm going to spend most of the time showing you without the chair but just know that this is an option okay so holding onto the chair and sidestepping but for everyone else feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then feet apart let me see that gets a bit tricky if you need it slower step feet together step feet together you want quicker let 's go pick the pace that you are at today okay again slow step step go quicker now I 've got a challenge for you all if you can also cause babies if I 'm out I 'm in arms out arms out in or even quicker okay out in out in this is a challenger today like I said I 'm going to get you moving so this is the hottest option out in out in and we slow it down in yeah okay that 's too tricky you just go back to your legs the main thing is we want to get moving and again pick whichever speed you are at all right have a break up all right last week we did seated punches so again another option is sitting on the chair front punches in front but today I 'm going through them in staining so today I 'd like you to have a split stance which means you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so get into that position and make sure you feel nice and strong that your weight is through both feet and not just one or the other so you want nice way through both feet I 'm going to stand front on so one foot forward one behind and come up and punch nice and forward okay we 're going to do 20 okay we 're gonna swap legs just so we 're even and we got another 20 beautiful okay now for a challenge them so I 'll hit my feet back I 've got my feet nice and planted I feel nice and strong if you do not feel comfort in that position just have your feet nice and wide and you can still punch that doesn 't mean you have to so again do whatever makes you feel comfortable now the challenge for this fight is to slowly rotate small through your body and punch across so we 're just getting a little bit of movement through our torso so we 're going to punch and slowly move that torso as we do it okay if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you straight punches okay I 'm gonna start to move let 's go again 20 good then you swap feet or have you feet nice and wide first option is forward second one is with the twist let 's go well done and if you 're sitting same thing I do a twist man well done I 'm sure your heart rate is up now because mine is so and next one I 'll show you firstly again you can use a chair is holding on and just try your best to keep your foot up to your bottom all right now some of us might only get to here that 's fine this is really good to get our legs moving and also really good for at any range of motion so this is option one option two would be not holding on and doing your kicks and then option three I 'm going to show you so I 'm going to face away just to show you the movement and it 's step kick so you 're bringing your whole foot off step kick step kick and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you it looks like this kick kick kick let 's go again option one it 's just holding onto the chair and doing your bottom kicks now depending on you guys out there who may have some aerobics background or you 're feeling like a challenge let 's add the arms and forward forward again you can suit up nice and slow peak what speed feels good for you your arms are too confusing you just go with the feet you 've got some I reckon beaks background adding arms got ten more I mean six seven eight nine ten beautiful alright and next one is our hot feet or fast feet so if you are sitting you can just bring your feet up and down now again if you 're unable just do some small marching because you think you 've got fast feet we 've got hot feet I say just give me some little taps if you want to add some arms in you can add a deliverer okay so let 's just eat it option standing often same thing you start with some small movement so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've gotta bring your legs up I just want small fast feet you want to add the arms in you had an T so just throw a leaf your feet up 10 more seconds and rest go again throughout the holidays exercise today you will notice your breath no getting a bit breathlessness if you do want to have a rest obviously please take a seat you can keep watching or pause the video and then start again when you feel good all right let 's go fast if you see this same thing as the arms me if you want my freaking arm to make it hot right girls even higher get you working and the rest good job if you eat your fat exercise today we 're going to do my favorite our super stands because we need to do them all the time so I 'm just gonna add them in okay and we 'll give you some options so again as I said in every video if you need the options overhand or use the handles if you need to use the chair use a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting down now to make it a cardio exercise to make it even harder you can do it nice and quick okay for some of this that 'll be a bit hard so if you 'll be able to go for it others I just want you up and down now today I 'm going to you eight I 'm gonna say I 'm done for already let 's do the whole way together and rest so anytime you 're doing these exercises if you get through them and you feel like that was easy you can always start the video again and do it again or just choose different rep ranges so the first three videos I did three lots of five reps just to get you started because that feels good through three lots of six next time view thriller today and the goal is to do two sets of ten or three sets of ten of each exercise that 's the goal so you build it up where you feel okay today we 're doing eight up down you 're feeling a challenge you can go be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where you feel safe you will know and rest you know today I 'm doing them a bit quicker again to get my heart pumping but you do them at the speed that you feel comfortable breather and then again pick you option this is for good job alright guys now it 's time to cool down so noticing but we want to start to reduce our breathing start to bring our breath back to normal so if you do you need to move it also focus on your breathing so breathing in through your nose okay if you can breathe in breathe out added stretching while you do it breathe in breathe out same as you do standing up so if you standing up same thing breathing arms up to the roof and breathe out nice big stretch breathing cooling down alright see now my favorite angle circles so while we 're starting to cool down you may add in some stretches so let 's do some of these back the other way other side so making sure anytime before you exercise those into a nice warm up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice cool down just to make sure our heart rate increases safely and then decreases thankfully as well it brings us back to normal okay shoulder rolls my next favorite if you are the desk add these into your day new nice big ones and small ones you do all of these exercises and sanding so you are doing standing and you 're done for the day well done you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

AUS,VIC,Hobsons Bay City Council,Hobsons Bay City Council,https://www.youtube.com/c/HobsonsbayVicGovAu,Words of Inspiration from women in Hobsons Bay,ECdZRd4crjA,20140319,992.68,"115 Civic Parade, Altona VIC 3018, Australia",2495,I i think that the women that inspired me from an early age would have to be my mother and a very strong women in the family I think probably my mum once again has been my biggest inspiration money should bring up three children on her own when I was only ten my dad left I 'm I guess the first person who inspired me was my grandmother she came from Tasmania from rural Tasmania and she didn 't have many opportunities in life because they lived on a farm and so she encouraged me to do all sorts of things along the way and every every challenge I had she supported I think most women would look towards their their immediate family and their peers my mother is an unbelievably inspirational female you know at retirement age and still working and raising a family and donating your time to charitable causes my grandmother is my biggest inspiration I guess because she was not only as strong but a very loving woman the fact that she worked so hard for her entire life and she loved doing that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inspiration my great aunts were terrific inspirations my great aunt Lizzie had the village sweet shop and so she was an incredibly pivotal part of the community of the village the sweetie shop was where everyone actually went to buy everything wasn 't just sweetie some vegetables there were groceries and her sister my auntie Nora helped her there and there were the warmest people you could imagine and they were like little birds they were great listeners to the village stories they were they always give a warm welcome to everyone who came into the shop and they loved me they totally loved me and I knew they loved me and and they always gave me the impression I could achieve anything personally for me my biggest inspiration would be my mum and was a woman she was quite quite a strong personality but still very family-orientated but I think she instilled in May the importance of a very good education and also to think a little bit for yourself and to just follow your dreams a woman that stands out very much is my English teacher from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting women to have a good education growing up I had one of my school teachers my maths teacher who was terribly fearsome but she suggested that women do things that jobs that men could do such as air traffic controlling for example she thought that was a good career for a woman I grew up in what you would call the bush in in Australia it 's a country village in Scotland on the west coast and we had to leave home when we were 15 to go on to high school we didn 't have one locally so you either went to high school or you stayed in the village for the rest of your life so most of us went to high school I was the first one to get there and I was miserable I was so homesick I just want to go home no my landlady was a very matter-of-fact heyland woman who spoke garlic actually and she would have none of it absolutely none of this silly girl crying in the corner homesick for goodness sake so she had a job in the caravan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and help me and we wash dishes and we dry dishes and I got home I so tired that I didn 't think to cry I went to be so I 'll and I learned from her how to tackle my life to recognize what was wrong and what to do about it which is work or do something for somebody else professionally obviously there 's the Governor General and the Prime Minister being females now there were you know finally able to breach that glass ceiling I 'd say Julia Gillard as well because you know she 's in our area of altona I 've lived here most of my life and just shows you again that a woman can strive to you know get into one of those positions Julia go ahead and definitely Quinton Bruce of course we 've had female Mears and we 've had a female councillors who have been great role models for us to look to I 'm not interested in politics so politicians don 't interest me so the people I thought of was Ida betrays I she I like what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity I think she did really well as a young woman you know she tackled a man 's world really and getting into publishing in and what she did with women 's magazines and so on personally probably my daughter is very inspiring at the moment that she gives so much back to the community as well as you know is trying to forge her own career at the same time and it 's just not prepared to just accept traditional you know concepts of what women should or shouldn 't do she just is making her own way in forging her own way in life so that 's very inspiring I 've always looked for people to inspire me who are calm and who know where they want to go and what they 're doing I think that you can find inspirational qualities amongst a lot of women I 'm in particular very focused on women that are entrepreneurial that can run their own businesses that can play with the big boys and really make a result it 's absolutely determination from a lot of these a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also how they deal with everyday life the overriding qualities of all of them is that they are great listeners so that they have time for people 's stories and they embrace the difference in all of us it 's definitely different for women than men insofar as that it is important for women to have and demonstrate passion and that kind of integrity about what they do they need to have a real drive as well to succeed and to go places and to you know breach those traditional barriers and go forward they all had a passion for what they did and they would try to do as much as they call him their their chosen field and they also took others along with them an inspirational woman doesn 't stand alone an inspirational woman works with a team a good team I feel that the greatest of our inspiring women around us arias leaders are those who take other people with them it 's not just a personal journey but they want to make a difference not to me is a great leader well I think these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put them down to the three C 's personally I think courage compassion and clarity for me I think strength and character it 's really important just being authentic as well what makes an inspirational woman is is a curiosity to be able to honestly rise above things but to be curious and to have to have a mind that you can fix it that you can do something about it that you don 't have to accept whatever is that is not necessary acceptable I haven 't had a female mentor personally not at a mentoring capacity I wish I did though and I think that if I did have a female mentor you know one-on-one that things would probably a little bit different for me and that 's why I feel that young women absolutely should have more female mentors around them I have had one person at work who did mentor me right from the very start really who in laboratory she took me under her wing and I think she saw some potential in me and she taught me the whole way along and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I still talk to her even 11 years after she retired so she had a big impact on my life I 've certainly know that jill has been toward me a lot over the years and I know I 've been always able to ask her a question of how she felt I should handle a certain situation and I think that 's what you need sometimes it 's someone you can ask that question of I think that it 's very important for people to be realistic about the world work and that they can also have an understanding from a more mature experienced person as to the pitfalls they may face there 's such a choice such that there 's so many things that young people can do then it must be confusing and it 's terrible to say when I when I was young I 'm well it was easy it was really easy you were either a secretary and us or a teacher so or domestic waste come domestic as terrible 's now I have never been mentored formally but certainly informally and probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such but I took tremendous wisdom from from people in my life a variety of people so most certainly I have been informally mentored and I think it 's a really important part of lives i think it 's almost um it 's almost like a duty we have yes sometimes women don 't necessarily go for positions because they don 't have a hundred percent of the the qualifications and sometimes we do need that little bit of a push or reassurance in in our skillset that we can develop into that ideal candidate still it 's still difficult sometimes in the workplace there is some you do have problems and I 've had problems along the way with men essentially doing things that they probably wouldn 't do to other men I think it 's really important that people stand up for their rights particularly women because if other women don 't stand up for them there is no hope really we all have to work together I think that specially younger women they don 't realize how important it is to position themselves in life and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some in games of power that sort of thing and some men 's going to try to say no wait this is not quite sure place this is my spot not every young person has those some opportunities some of a court you know disadvantage I think that you know we all die to ourselves so much throughout our lives and to know that somebody is just there for you and believes in you and is willing to give you a bit of time and encouragement more women that are more experienced or old them should be putting their hand up and going yes let me help you mentor you know let me be your mentor and be passionate about it in mental health is a service now where people with a mental health issue can actually have a mentor and that can help them with their recovery journey and help them you know where where they they do suffer self-esteem problems and confidence issues so mentor can help a lot with some of those things I think if they can find another female that 's in that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good thing for them to nurture them and just you know help help them along their way just open up your world of thinking as well number one hope is for women to feel safe there 's still too many sexual abuse cases going on in the home out on the street I just think it 's abominable in this day and age first of all I 'd like to see them safe I 'd really like to see that the women of hobsons bay could walk out their front door at any time and not give a thought to will I go all or not is it dark or is it not is a train safe as a bus safe as the street say they hold you back it can hold you back equality full stop my hope for women in hobsons bay and beyond is for women to continue getting educated really well-educated to hold great positions of power I hope once again that young people will be taking every opportunity with regard to education I just hope that they can feel a sense of community and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets that hobsons bay has and contribute you know as much as they can to the community hobsons phase is already a bit of a lighter compared to some of the council 's that I 've saying we 've got a fairly strong female representation and yeah I just hope that we sort of continue in that area yeah and just um that get more women to speak out and voice their opinion and if they see things that need to be changed that we give them the avenues that they can do that i 'd like to see women really really step out and support each other i still feel that women often lack a sense of their own inherent courage and i think that together we can actually overcome that and we can achieve great things if we do have these opportunities to band together you know like our women 's Advisory Committee you can just kind of sense that palpable strength and to put that out in the community ya can achieve anything I think that we need to celebrate women more women are not recognized enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know we need to really start celebrating what women can can achieve and whether that be at a community level in their families in their houses I mean we 're amazing creatures we are absolutely amazing creatures we can do phenomenal things and I think that sometimes women don 't celebrate other women enough and what we need to do is we need to gather around as it as a group as a unit and really celebrate each other 's achievements and and lead by example and show people how fantastic women are you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

3018, Australia",1891,so my name is richard dove and i am multicultural liaison officer for victoria police for the western suburbs of melbourne since 2006 the program has been running taking young people in the community who have arrived in australia as refugees developing their leadership skills through a series of programs and camps so that they can be a role model for others in the community over a period of time we 've worked with over a hundred participants and a lot of the koran and the south sudanese who made up that program were all fairly new they had most of them had been here less than a year and so we were really learning about them at that time and we knew very little but we also learned that there was a difference in the way in which they came to australia so the quran sat in refugee camps for up to 20 25 years and some of our young people were even born in the refugee camp and had just arrived in australia and this was their first experience of what it was like to be in australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobson 's bay council represented through multicultural services and youth services and scott sutton who 's youth resource officer of hobsons bay and also western bulldogs through their settlement program they actually receive funding to settle refugees and get them involved in sport so kimmy lay from western bulldogs is involved in that we all bring our own expertise and something that we 've got to give to the program and i think that 's what 's made it it the success that it is today my name is rick kimbamba and my nickname is rick both and currently i 'm studying the community at the university and working with the community getting more involved the community i came from the democratic party of congo and because of the political issues that 's why we have to flee the country coming to australia i had to learn the language and that really i have really had a hard time dealing with that english was not my first language and it was hard for me to express myself and for it i remember always working with a dictionary wherever i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy egg i have to show people read first in my bilingual dictionary and it was hard for me to to understand each other to understand the person the first activity about that did the community was about the leadership program the word first of all leadership really got my attention and interests me because i i 'm gonna learn more about leadership living with people you know life in general it has helped me to improve my english communicating with people having the confidence among people as a group as a team and being more like social helping the community at the start when i was coming this kind of thing i never done before i never done that back in where i came from i felt also a sense of belonging there that i can actually contribute a lot to the community and i was asked if i can come back to do to be like a mentor into the second leadership program how to make a leadership program even better than what we did before the first one was more about about the leadership style but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people will going to learn all the leadership styles through the activities that we 'll be doing and it didn 't just stop there one day i received a letter from the the council telling me that when i opened the letter telling me starting with the congratulations you are the new citizen of the year at the start i didn 't get it because i didn 't know the real meaning of young season yeah my pictures my face was everywhere on the road and that actually also turned me into like a figure that everybody was looking and knowing knowing me and and and inspiring other people life being the first example of being a good leader so that can inspire them to become also good even better than me i came to learn that the point of living life is just about doing what you love doing and changing people 's life if you can do those things do things then just amazing my name is ima i 'm a korean ethnic in burma i live in the refugees camp for 23 years in my whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of education health especially what we can 't move freely move we can go outside the camp we have a long civil war in burma especially korean and the burmese conflict for over 60 years it 's really hard to live there but we we managed for 23 years so at the time my parents decide we 're going to move to another country to to seek a better a better life even though i 'm from burma i 'm not a a burmese citizen and also growing up in thailand i 'm not a thai citizen so it 's mean i 'm not belonging to any country so becoming australian citizens that means something i belong here this is my country for me i just have to start for the beginning when i yeah as a a kid start step by step that one it 's like a new baby in this country one of my friends she was participating in the program before so she talked to me because i was in the country just not that long for just only a year and then i didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be involved in the within the leadership or in the in the mainstream community the benefit of the leadership program is the connection the networking and also you know more about the the system here and then you get to know the service provider it 's given me the new ideas where it 's totally different from where i when i from i think it 's not a good leader just a leader you stand up and lead in someone you tell someone to do things things like that but it 's feel good about yourself i think i feel good i 'm doing a radio program it 's really good for me i learned the skill it 's good for the other people the community to listen to the program i 'm staying at social work at the rmit i really want to walk overseas maybe with my in burma or thailand i want to be around with people helping people if i work with them it 's more going to be very a benefit for them and also for me to get more experience to help people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full name is paul popo anita senba i was born in 1995 life in the refugee camp as a child for me it was really fun a lot of friends a lot of games there 's a seven or eight different refugees camp across thai border my background 's karen and my parents my mom from burma but were not burmese or korean in 2000 my dad went to the forest and disappeared he didn 't come back we didn 't know whether he alive or dead i just wish i can change that time and wish i spent more time with him we came in australia just me and my sister my mom my brother four of us i 'll be the first one in sandbar family finish year 12. like i 'll be the first one finish school in australia that 's it means something to us you know for some people it 's not but for us it is something sometimes i thought that the friends i made in leadership programs is close so then the friends are made at school i think it 's because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant swing because it 's 21 meter high i went up to the top i forgot to pull the red rope because if you pull the red rope it will let you go i forgot to pull it and then they like pull the red rope and like yeah pulled it and i 'm just like wish away and and i scream i 'm really scared after this giant scene i was like i can do that that 's nothing you know it 's it just feel good like breathtaking we have i lead camp that 's after hobson bay camp jay is the one who appoints me to go to the camp i 'm so glad that she picked me she didn 't at me we went to horse riding and we we get like our own t-shirt we make them and the theme of the program is um for our group it 's love your culture never forget it we went surfing at angus seas it was my first time surfing i 'm really worried i 'm going to but i just i just served and i did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like cheering which is amazing feedback i thought i 'm the only refugees but actually i 'm not there 's other people that have been have tough time than me i should consider myself always lucky becoming a police officer would fulfill my dream i want to go there as a recruit one of the excursions we get to go to police academy i didn 't know they 're going to be that fun or that 's playful they were officer you know they 're meant to be a bit yeah but they 're really fun for me a good leaders you have to understand people you 're not you can 't dis discriminate them due to their education level or anything a good leader is always theirs to help a people and just to work with them no matter what and when they heard awards thank you that was a happy life i learned that even though a person can live 20 to 25 years in a refugee camp that they can still have a very positive outlook on life and that um it doesn 't matter where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your life or how traumatic culture is culture but also people are people and the things that they want are exactly the same that a person can hold on to their culture who they are because that 's their identity but they also become a part of the community and in doing that they bring who they are their culture their new way into this and actually have something positive to bring and then that is kind of rewarded through all of australia receiving something new and better so you,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

the war started sangla was very badly hit you know with air raids and we lost two houses there to the bumps you know two houses that we lived in so my parents said look we 've gotta move from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of my granny you know we managed to find a house in a room which is an inner suburb in and we stayed there till I really left Malta to come to Australia i was born in st. nicholas street valletta and we we stayed there for about three years when i was about tree we moved to st. Nicholas at all st. Dominic 's to Vanessa and that is the house that one day when Italy joined the war three months after in September 1940 where we came out of the shelter after an airway and we found that our apartment was completely demolished and we found ourselves completely homeless you know we we lived there with my mom 's aunt for a few months and Robert just for a few months until the housing department found us a place in st. Paul Street valletta which was a huge house really and ten families were living in there in voltage called the Correa acaryas is a big house where a lot of families living like we were allotted one room only and there was four bus so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to live in Newport and we used to go to being Roman Catholic we used to attend church every Sunday and this was a sacred heart church in New carson street newport and quite a few of us Vince was one of them we used to made there and now I 'm talking something like 36 months after I came to Australia see and we we all sort of realized that there wasn 't really much going there for for the Maltese you know and we kind of got to talk about and I said why don 't we organise something and as it turned out at the time one of the priests from the Missionary Society of st. Paul where was serving the Maltese community they 're not so much the Maltese community but the church and he said look why don 't we organize something where a meeting in 1973 and we formed a committee I was elected president right Vince at the time I can 't remember it wasn 't i wasn 't in the first love yeah that 's right yes yeah the first thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join yeah cuz he knew we were teenagers with each other yeah the one we were kids and we organize our first function which was a dinner dance at the fiesta ballroom and footscray at the time it 's not there anymore and it was such a huge success we 're coming yeah they were coming from everywhere all of a sudden not just you promoted which showed us you know that there was really a need to do something and I mean coming from a place where we you could say it 's a noisy place you know to Australia and so quiet in the streets you know after six o 'clock at the time the pups were closing down you know apart from the local picture theatre there was nothing else going for right and we were we most of us are the outgoing type you know and anyway and just disassociation before you know it it really really really grew and then this was that was 1973 then in 1978 the maltese community council invites us to affiliate with the with the council which we did and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community center which is this place here where we are because I could see that if we come up with some kind of a community center here and the Maltese commuting will come will come forward a lot you know and we started fundraising did we and we work we work we work with it you name it we did it we even had a subcommittee of the ladies sewing toys or soft toys and in one year I remember what about what about baking cakes yeah everything we did everything you know to raise money and I remember one year the ladies on their own through this subcommittee you know there is five thousand dollars now when you talk five thousand dollars and seventy-eight 79 that 's that was a lot of money you know and softwares and we were we were very very successful in raising fund and 5 verse time we had enough money to to build this place I think it only took about 18 months or so and it was open there in 1983 here we are at the library I believe this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surprised how many not only Maltese how many Australians come in here to borrow books to learn about malta to learn about the history and culture you name it you know but then we 've got the whole of course there are other offices at the back there when is the president 's office one office it 's the welfare group used as well but then we go we 've got the whole which is on that side of the building and you 'll see it there there 's a lot of activities at the moment going on the latest playing and the bingo there they love their bingo you notice there there 's a group of men that play billiards there and I have to say this they 're louder than the ladies are playing you know the the big order so but they have fun there they have fun fantastic he is the master of rules and regulations there you know but they enjoy they 'll love it you know they 're a good group and I mean they 're the largest person that you could think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is what makes it so good everybody gets on so oh yeah each other yeah yeah yeah it 's like our second home yeah we don 't always look forward to come yeah well we can 't make it to the Wednesday you know yeah you know we break up for Christmas for three or four weeks and when we come back there was there are you know that was shocking you know not coming here oh yeah too long","(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

3018, Australia",1607,hi my name is Suzanne I 'm installation artists and I click story my name is Lara Lee stand up hi i 'm jung kook I 'm an industrial designer and sculptor my name is Emily Boyle my name is Brendan town why I don 't know just something in and appeals to me I just keep getting drawn back to it I 'm Justin mwah and a local artist I just do I do a lot of a lot of research I read a lot of books and a lot of googling and a lot of movies and and stuff like that it 's looking at elements of our physical environment and the way memory and values and emotions can be wrapped up in buildings and also the notion of permanence and impermanence important part of my translation is the background that I do and one one of the things I do is I collect stories about the community and try to find the identity and find the connections about that place so I could integrate it into string story they sort of mixed media on paper I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken photographs and manipulated them digitally and then from a from a print out I 've transferred that onto the paper when I put it all together and think about like why I like these things like what interests me it 's always the same the same like small concept or idea like I mean like I 'm doing me this stuff on on paper and it isn 't enough I mean this is why I have a small space and I put everything up and you have to be in it like submerged come on guys keep up what we 've got here is a sculpture called Westies and we 're down at a point of milk very cool little breakfast spot where STIs is primarily about resourcefulness and the use of materials that you wouldn 't imagine as useful as they can be these crows are made out of truck tire inner tubes so the idea basically is that from what is considered to be rubbish you can actually find some really interesting abstractions of the basic material in the sidewall of a truck tire in a tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube spinning inside the actual tire itself so I 've used those two to make an indication of the line down the center of each of the feathers on the wing and that here there are a set of five of them and the idea that Armand who 's the owner and myself came up with was to have them come flying out of the kitchen so it looked a bit like four and twenty you know blackbirds baked in a pie from their kitchen I think that 's what I love about these art events is just being able to see all the artists together with some wines and some food and speeches and people celebrating each other 's work it 's really good to see people especially in your own community out there doing similar sort of things and knowing that you 're not the only person that 's shutting themselves away in a shed for a number of days while you sort of make a mess I think it 's really a very creative community around here it 's nice being among like-minded people and having that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a connection between the person looking and the person that 's actually made this thing that it 's a satisfaction for the artist because it 's that the message has been met squarely by the viewer and then you get to say the works which is like a kind of second surprise and and it 's always like opening a present yet to say what 's inside started with the the London riots and I watched this YouTube click someone had set up an elaborate YouTube clip of background noise of the London riots with the Lego men started with a serious intent that sort of became a bit of a parody of violence and stuff like that you know what I did was I hand-painted with using spray paint and an ink pigment deep pan painted about 20-25 Lego ink on newsprint paper just flour water and sugar and I had it I had a bit of a bit of wood PVA glue to it at the end just to give it a bit of extra sticks no no nothing to wear the prison yeah no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people can see it and enjoy it and according to Paul people have been enjoying it and taking photos and stuff but they can 't sort of commodify it which is Josh 's focus was a street art focus and it 's for us that works really well because we have a very casual atmosphere and so it was loose and fun and we were able to plaster the outside of the building and that 's fine as well and that creates interest in the street for us to sew on so yeah that 's that 's been really good fun I 've got three pieces in the in the show this year the main one is memory lane it 's basically a big piece of red gum that I 've split into 13 pieces and each piece represents a significant event in my life so it 's kind of like tracing back from my birth right up to them till now obviously there 's only 13 pieces and it 's very condensed I suppose so rather than just stick to one material Oh some often I 'll use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rare that I 'll just use one one thing one part that no one else 's tattooed and that 's a heart so I thought well I 'll tattoo a heart and and that sort of brings contemporary sort of thinking to an old sort of representation of the heart or suppose it has an arrow and a heart which is an old classic sort of symbol but this has got an earring or two earrings attached to it as well so there 's different meanings of the the word piercing so so all three are in in the Pacific Center in our town I think what I what I like about having public places is the connections that you make with the business owners and and the way that you get to walk into these shops and cafes in with it with the kind of different a different state of mind where you 're not just looking for you know clothes you 're you 're also looking for the artwork if you 're looking around the store and any seeing it for more than what you normally would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crazy little kids hey it 's looking for something wild and just and nuts just a massive kind of squiggly lines and colors and I think that 's what I try and do is make something that 's not depicting not a complete depiction of a real life so I 'm on the computer now you 're getting images and piecing them together cutting them out collaging and putting those down I just kind of think to myself that if I 'm having fun doing it then that 's fine that 's what my artwork is is the first time it 's sensational I can 't believe from driving past this building some months ago that it 's a complete metamorphosis in from a slug to a butterfly if you 're doing our work which you think is you know good enough to go into galleries and just try and find something that will take your work because I didn 't think I 'd have stuffing galleries at all the art in public places festival is absolutely vital it makes this great connection between the artist and a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast or whatever and to see those two join together it 's a conversation starter it 's a point of recognition for artists and you know I think the Hobson 's Bay City Council are right on the mark with this I think it 's absolutely spectacular I would definitely recommend that businesses in the local area become part of this program as I said before everybody wins it 's definitely worthwhile you know what is the first thing that seems most obvious we are actually interested in overlooked and neglected spaces and these abandoned spaces are I see them as lonely landscapes that wants to talk and converse with people around them so what I do is use string as a wage that dies in suspension of the voice of the space of web in a way is like a big thing that kind of trans people and or entrapped people and look at it and encouraged to interact with it or get stuck in it I just want to go in there and timpleman make it me back in one string at a time and reveal the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to take over the world secretly,"(-37.863727, 144.8310159)"

traveling with my own cheer squad so and actually i think the cheer squad didn 't realize i was speaking until they got here um i 'd like to start by acknowledging uh that we are meeting this morning on the lands of the laundry warren people and pay my respects to elders past present and emerging as i wrote this yesterday i was reflecting on the way in which our understanding of indigenous history has changed over my lifetime i grew up in east and kilda a place that appeared to me as a child to be singly singularly devoid of indigenous history and in fact if you 'd asked me what i knew about aboriginal australia as a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melbourne um but something i now know of course to be nonsense uh sinclair has a very strong indigenous history but for those of you who like me are on the other side of 50 you 'll appreciate how far we 've come over our lifetime and how far we 've still got to go as a child i did not know i was on indigenous land let alone know the name of it and that 's very different in our schools um later and thank you to the mayor and uh good at all the blokes in the room lovely to have you welcome to women 's day we have one you 've got 364. um no i thought i 'd be good in my uh afl role so for those of you who don 't know i 'm about to become the president of the north melbourne football club [Applause] thus proving that women can hold positions of power at the top and the bottom of the afl ladder uh in my afl role i will i 've been lucky enough to witness three indigenous rounds over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melbourne and brisbane football clubs as part of their aflw seasons and again a sentence we could not have uttered a decade ago so thank you for doing me the huge honour of inviting me here to talk on international women 's day about my two main passions hubs and football honestly it 's like a dream gig and you 'll be lucky i 've got to keep an eye on the time because they 've told me 20 minutes and you 'll be lucky um so hopefully there 'll be something in this speech for everyone for those of you who love hubs and there 's plenty in the room who do we 're going to spend a bit of time on that for those of you who love footy and hopefully there are a couple of footy heads in the room we 'll spend a bit of time on that too so i 've been ceo of community hubs australia for nearly seven years and for those of you who don 't know and i am going to tell you about hub so those of you who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm probably going to get it wrong but i 'm telling my story and i 've got the microphone and as we know history is written by the people with the microphone um hubs are based in primary schools state catholic and independent and work with families predominantly women and predominantly women from non-english speaking backgrounds with preschool children so that 's predominantly what we 're talking about and hubs connect them first of all with each other often a hub is the first place a woman 's been asked to come into with local services with their schools hubs at least our iteration of them were invented in hume right here in hume about 14 or 15 years ago and we can argue about the timeline and at time when local school principals were concerned about the increasing phenomena of children from non-english speaking backgrounds starting their first day of school having had zero contact with services so at best you might have been talking about a child with separation anxiety but you 're probably talking about a child who hadn 't been to kindergarten hadn 't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hadn 't had speech checks or hearing checks or any of the things that nice middle class children like mind take for granted and which are so important in the early years development of our children which left prep teachers dealing with a range of problems child or family who didn 't understand the learning system separation anxiety a child not ready to be at school and in the words of one principle i met soon after i started in this role one of those in your class was disruptive but when it was half the class or more that 's the year gone so those principles started along with council with a series of bilingual play groups in an attempt to get children into the school space earlier and soon worked out that what they were dealing with was an issue not of isolated children but of isolated women and from there the hub concept was born the model itself is pretty simple it started pretty simple and it stayed pretty simple now the women in this room who run hubs know that it 's become a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because what they do you know they 're building on building on building but in it at its essence four things the first is engagement and i talked about that before that often women are asked into a hub and they 've never been asked anywhere before second early childhood play groups are our bread and butter and have been since those early trials of hubs but we go further than that it 's about getting children and families connected into whatever the local service set is and whatever the local pathway is and as we 've expanded nationally i 've learned what states kinder means kinder and what states it means prep and what anyway everybody 's got a different word for everything the third is english and actually it 's literacy in any language for children as long as mums or dad are teaching the child in their first language a school teacher can help them learn english but if they 're not becoming literate in their first language really hard to become literate new second for women though it 's unashamedly english and i could board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women miss out on english language as migrants to this country is disgraceful the proportion of women who 've been here for 20 years or more who don 't speak english is appalling it 's not their fault it 's ours and yes they can make a strong economic contribution to our country but you 're vulnerable if you don 't speak the language in the of the place you live and the fourth one is vocational pathways that might be volunteering might be skills training might be connection into jobs hubs are safe place for women to model and experience work and in a nutshell that 's the model and has been the model for well over a decade and we 've taken what was a very sensible straightforward successful idea invented tested and rolled out in initially 9 and then 15 sites in hume and expanded it to 94 actually 97 schools across queensland new south wales victoria and south australia with another eight sites due to open this year we 're funded by federal government for state governments and this outstanding local government and every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backbone costs for over a decade i 've got to say and i 'm just going to pause there for a minute hume should be incredibly proud as a local government area of the leadership role it took not just in helping develop this model but in proof of concept and in sticking behind it for well over a decade and every one of you knows in the jobs that you do of the things that come and go for two years here or three years there or bits of funding here or the single best thing we achieved as a network hands down was three years ago getting ongoing funding from the federal government so we 're not project funded anymore and that 's a hell of an achievement but that starts here and most of the local government areas we work with across australia from townsville up up the north right through to playford i hope that 's not mine um have between three to five hubs there are 15 in hume that 's outstanding absolutely outstanding so across the country we worked with nearly 10 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place by service that kept operating through lockdowns two thousand of those families are here in hume i talk about hubs a lot i could talk about them all day they 're cost effective they deliver a staggering return on investment they 've benefits for schools and communities and services and families and above all they 're sensible and god knows there 's plenty of stuff out there that isn 't but today is international women 's day so i 've been asked to talk about the way hubs empower migrant women so let 's talk about that so remember i said earlier that in the early days principals discovered that the problem that they were facing was isolated women not isolated children well that 's a problem i 've seen replicated in every single community we work in and in pretty much every migrant group it 's not just an issue for refugees the wives of skilled visa holders are actually probably some of the most isolated women i 've ever met their husbands will often come here and have work and they 've come here with him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only time they 'll leave home will be to take the child to school or pick the child up again in the afternoon and bear in mind often these women have skills themselves and i want to be quite clear we 're not talking about isolation in the way that we might have traditionally understood it um the women might have plenty of connections within their immediate family and with it with their home country the internet makes it perfectly possible to keep reading the papers from home or watching tv from home or connecting in with another culture but well they are isolated from our broader community and that can have all kinds of consequences so i 'm going to give you some examples of some of the women i 've met over the last six years or so i remember meeting a burmese woman in one of our logan hubs and she was the mum with the difficult child you know the one with behavioural issues that nobody wanted so nobody wanted her around so even the people in her uh cultural group wouldn 't invite her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hub leader identified that uh there was something this wasn 't a naughty child that there was something that wasn 't right with the child anyway long story short got the school involved child was just is diagnosed with a severe learning disorder found a place in the local special school for the child found support for the mother and importantly gave her some coping skills and introduced her to some friends in the hub and she had somewhere safe to come and have a cup of tea and talk to people and that 's the first time in her time in australia that that had happened there 's a pet was a pakistani woman in one of our hume hubs beautiful english and three degrees an incredibly qualified woman who 'd been working in a fruit shop actually for a dreadfully low amount of money she had no idea how to do a job interview in australia and how to behave in a western work context when she went to an interview she wanted to talk about her degrees and her learning what the interviewers wanted to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she just didn 't have the the wherewithal to do that again the hub helped her learn how to have conversations here learn how to to socially interact here and learn how to be in a workplace here i met a vietnamese woman in brimbank who had been working in australia for more than 20 years and her children had grown up and left home and she didn 't have anyone to talk to anymore and she hadn 't learnt english in those 20 years and she was coming to the hub to learn the language of the country that she 'd been living in for 20 years because she was lonely met an assyrian woman in a western sydney hub who 'd been a refugee from the age of two and had never learnt to write her own language she could speak it she couldn 't write it she come to australia and learn to speak english the mother 's day the year before her children had given her a card written in her language because they 'd learnt it at school she couldn 't read it so again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language all of these things are about empowerment right and there 's no government program for this stuff but there is a really sensible grassroots community answer to it and hubs are providing that every day hubs see the women that nobody else does because they 're coming to school for their children or because their friends or family bring them to the hub and because they know it 's a welcoming non-judgmental space i remember once someone from maternal child health and our enormous respect and if you 're in the room g 'day and you do a fantastic job but i remember someone saying to me once we get 83 of women come to their second appointment and my question was not about the 83 it 's about the 17 who aren 't and actually who are the ones who didn 't come to a first appointment because that 's they 're the people we need to be measuring ourselves against the other great thing about hubs is they see everyone in terms of their assets and if you 've got a skill they will find it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here who i remember once explaining to me without uh any sense of irony at all her view that when a woman first comes in as a mother she 's a mother and then she becomes a volunteer and then there 's an opportunity to become more than a volunteer and then a bit of training over here and before you know it you 've got yourself a child care worker on your hands i should have you recruiting for the north melbourne football club actually um so to be honest that 's how we should view these women too as assets in our community perhaps they have a skill or a talent we could use a viewpoint that might enrich our world a contribution to make but we 'll never know if we don 't invite them in and make space for them to join and that 's exactly what hubs do and hubs do it in a way that recognize that most of these women are mothers most of them have caring responsible abilities many of them don 't speak english but it doesn 't mean they don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 women in across australia were coming to hubs voluntarily to attend conversational english classes even in lockdown hubs work around the rhythm of their day and the reality of their lives and they 're creating stronger schools and communities in which women are a critical contributing component and above all hubs are creating connection before i move on from hubs i want to pay tribute to the incredible women across australia who are our hub leaders and support coordinators there 's a bunch of them in the room today who didn 't know i was speaking but i am so now i 'd like you all to stand up please all of you who are involved in the hume house [Applause] each of them is employed by their school or by their local organization and each of them has developed her hub according to the needs of her local community and her school not according to a community hubs recipe book we don 't tell them how to be we give them those four elements we give them the support they need and we let them get on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this no one ever got good directions from someone sitting at a collins street office telling them telling them how to run their community program these women are innovative and positive empathetic and essential energetic and grounded they are in many ways the unsung heroes of our communities and i am so incredibly proud of them and so extremely fortunate to represent them here uh today and the work i do every day so on the topic of fortunate the second thing you 'll know about me is that i 'm the incoming president of the north melbourne football club i 've chosen to be president a lot of people ask me when this became news whether i was going to be the chairman or the chairwoman i said i 'm going to be the president because a it says that in the constitution and b it just sounds quite trumpian and i think i think i could go with it so i know there are a couple of north supporters in the room and you are clearly special people oh yeah fantastic um is there anyone in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football team fantastic you 're on my list you 're all on my list for afterwards north melbourne now maureen could you just take those names for me thank you it 's an incredible privilege to be the next president of the north melbourne football club i 've been north for as long as i can remember we had reserve seats at arden street back in the day when there were still seats at arden street they were metal uh we went to away games at every ground around the afl my of around the vfl my my melbourne geography as a kid was basically restricted to if you had a team i knew where you were and if you didn 't so i still to this day don 't know where box hill is cannot um we still doing tiptoes in the outer and there was that thing as a kid of always being ready to jump the fence on the final siren trying to beat the kids the players and every other kid to the race so you could high-five the players as they went it never occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i was a kid and a football supporter and that 's what you did and i kind of reckon wouldn 't be awesome if you just take that energy into the rest of your life and so while so much of football and of north has changed since i was a kid the core ingredients are the same intensely competitive the most passionate and loyal and best supporters and club that knows that you don 't have to be the biggest to be the best and for those of you who don 't speak afl we are the smallest club in victoria but we are the best club in victoria we 're also at the bottom of the ladder but that 's neither here nor there my north journey kicked up a notch in 2007 when the afl tried to move the club to the gold coast and i got involved with the campaign to keep north south that was a proper grassroots movement and critically important moment in helping me to understand what the club meant not just to me and my family but to so many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential way they 're about belonging being part of something that 's bigger than yourself that takes you out of yourself that connects you to people you would otherwise never have met and i have friends through football who are in such amazingly different and diverse worlds to mine and they enrich my world every single day and just to be completely clear if i meet you today i 'll probably forget your name but i 'll remember who you 're barrack for because that turns out to be the way i think about the world sorry girls so in 2011 i joined the club as the first woman on their executive heading up the huddle which was their community arm which works with young people in and around north melbourne i was really privileged to spend five years building the huddle at north and incredibly proud of what it achieved there were very few women across the afl in executive roles at that time and i used to joke that in that world i was diversity i was over 40 and i was female and if any of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that is i left the club for community hubs in 2015 a decision that was a fantastic decision and i returned as a board member at the end of 2019 just before covert hit my very interesting first year on a board and now in 2022 i find myself on the cusp of being president so i can 't tell you what it 's like to be present in a male-dominated industry but after a decade of involvement i can tell you what it 's like to be involved and if you ask me back in a couple years i 'll tell you what it 's like to be president probably the first is this is a tough industry to make it as a woman and if you want proof of that i 'd point out that most football boards only have a handful of female directors the western bulldogs are the exception with 50 50 but they are the standout in that so pat on the back of your western bulldogs supporter and i 'll be just the fourth president ever so it 's four out of 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is a step in the right direction but it is by no means good enough and nobody should be patting themselves on the back about that we know that even in football sorry we know that even in female dominated industries boards tend to be chaired by men we know that women the further up you go in an organisation the more likely the senior roles are to be taken by men so football isn 't on its own here nevertheless this one quite literally is a boys club so while there 's progress it 's slow my second observation is even if it 's slow it 's having impact by definition if you bring in outsiders in this case women you increase the diversity and thinking and skill base at your disposal you do better we know that organizations with diverse boards outperform those that don 't have diverse sports and football is a competitive industry and it matters to have different approaches and different streams of thought i 'll give you a different perspective on this until recently i was chair of a family violence service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macaulay community services for women and we had on our board um uh three men um it was big board bought at 12 which people tell me is too big and i 'll tell you it 's the best board i 've ever been on and bringing men onto that board in a in a arena that is traditionally it 's quite unusual for a family violence service to have men on the board and it was incredibly important for us to bring that thinking into the room and also to recognize that this was a whole of community problem not a women 's problem to solve so diversity works both diversity works in a multiplicity of ways we 're talking about gender today i 've also lost count of the number of people who told me that both of last year 's grand final teams had female presidents and i 've got to tell you that if north make it off the bottom of the ladder to the grand final this year i will be claiming the credit um but i wouldn 't hold your breath north people i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my third observation is that sexism is still there but it 's much better better than it was these days the barriers are less obvious so it 's less around the way you get talked to or the opportunities you don 't have but here 's a simple example most of the people nominated for committee or board roles are still men why because they 're being nominated by other men and they tend to be nominated from the high-level coterie groups so members number of members might male and female is the same but as you move your way up through the the people who are prepared to spend more money on this it tends to be more men so we 've got a selection issue and we need to deal with that um there 's a thing that always makes me laugh in meetings and i don 't know if any of you have experienced this but just before one of the male directors is about to swear he 'll turn to me and apologize and then he swears anyway and i want to say to him oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because i 'll teach you language you didn 't know yeah secondly if it 's going to be offensive to me it could just as easily be offensive to the man sitting next to me and if you think it 's going to be offensive don 't do it rather than i don 't know somehow i 've apologized to the girl so it 's okay to go ahead with this now has anyone else experienced that it 's a ripper my final observation though is this i 've made it to this role with the support of the men and the women around me not in spite of them they picked me well before i picked them and somebody asked me last week how long i had been thinking about being president of the northbound football club and the answer is i hadn 't um and when i had to when i reflected on that uh that was weird because actually i 've always ended up leading pretty much everything i 've done i 've you know i 'm the the kid who wanted to be head girl you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i had planned to join the board but i hadn 't planned to lead the board and they came and asked me if i would do it and i had to reflect on why i hadn 't seen myself in that role and i think that this is an important take home for women generally until we start to see ourselves in those roles we 're not going to occupy those roles with comfort and one of the important things for me being in this role is that other people will see me in this role and maybe start to imagine themselves in there too so the challenge for me is to make this a little bit easier for the next woman who comes along to hopefully inspire younger women inside and out of the industry to set their heights high sights high and what the heck older women do and let 's not pretend i 'm also here to help us win a flag and on that note happy international women 's day and thank you so much for having me so i don 't know whether that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit less but it doesn 't really matter i think that everyone who 's sitting in this room today absolutely enjoy everything that you have to say sonia such a a

communities i acknowledge the elders of the many communities that call him home and the women in those communities who lead nurture and progress positive change and i know we 've got women leaders from a number of communities including first nations communities with us today so thanks for coming so as the mayor said my name is bernadette and i 've been with whom as a manager of sustainable environment for about 10 years i think and i mostly work on environment conservation community engagement sustainability cultural heritage projects but i 've also spent a lot of time as the mayor said working on gender issues and trying to correct some of those gender imbalances that have become normal in a lot of our workplaces over time so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'd like to uh welcome our three panel members and if they would if the three pentamen would like to just come up together onto the stage and then when you 've had a seat and you 've you 're um settled in i 'll introduce you give them a clap while they 're getting up into the stage so first off we have uh sheena frost it 's all right that 's i 'm i 'm pausing you 're okay uh sheena frost who is the ceo of hume city council shane has been with us i think since august last year is that right yeah yep so a short period of time but she 's also made a lot of wonderful changes and particularly in the era of gender equality since you 've been here so she 's a highly regarded leader in local government and in 2019 was recognized as one of the top 50 public sector women by the institute of public administration so welcome sheena and thanks for being on our panel secondly i 'd like to introduce and welcome ajamin khan hi arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's the founder and managing director of stem catalyst which is an all-female lead stem education consultancy that does a lot of work in i think at this stage still mostly hume schools and moreland that 's right human moreland schools so if if you 've got kids and they 're in a hume school chat to arge later because they 've got a range of really great um stem-based programs for our school kids and arg is also a hume enviro champion and she graduated i think in 2017 yeah so that 's one of our leadership environmental programs at hume so welcome arjun [Applause] and finally sally curtin who is the ceo and i think i 'm going to get this wrong it 's kangan institute now isn 't it is that right yeah okay great good so sally 's the ceo of the kangan institute and she is also an accomplished public sector senior executive with significant experience across state and local government including recently with the department of justice city of casey and vic rhodes so welcome sally and thanks for joining us today so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's your turn to speak i 'm hoping rit people will assist if with our mics so maybe just give us a hollow just go sheena you go first hello that sounded like it was doing something is that working yes yep good arch you want to go next um one two three testing very good and sally hi everyone all right we 're on thank you okay so it 's um i guess and it 's exciting time to be a woman if that 's maybe that 's in inverted commerce from a local government perspective we 've got more women councillors in victoria than ever before we 've got 44 percent of our council as a female i 'm pretty sure we 've got more female ceos than than ever before but i couldn 't find a statistic on that but here 's my statistic of the last four appointments that i know in the north and the western suburbs local government councils those councils have appointed females and and sheena is one of them and they 've replaced long-standing male very successful male ceo so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening in our sector as well women outnumber men in university enrolments we 've had our first female prime minister we can work and have a family and there 's an increased critical mass of women 's visibility across every aspect of our lives so everything 's going okay isn 't it not i 'm reading the room i 'm not quite getting it so but whatever advancements have been made there 's still a lot of work to do we still have a significant gender pay gap which is currently 23 in australia globally women 's education and health is worse than that of men reports of domestic abuse against women are through the roof and the covert pandemic exposed the disproportionate burden of unpaid care carried by women and to kind of link into one of the themes today we also know that women and girls experience the greatest impacts of climate crisis of the climate crisis they depend more on yet have less access to natural resources and often bear a disproportionate responsibility for securing food water and and fuel so we 've got some good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do i think so today our panelists are going to help us with how we might break through some of those barriers so there 's two themes for international women 's day today one is breaking the bias so you 've seen everybody doing the so give us a everybody give us a thank you very nice and the other one is changing climates equality today for a sustainable tomorrow and that 's declared by un women so this is my first question to the panelists is what does the theme changing climates equality today for a sustainable tomorrow mean to you personally so i 'm gonna because shane is the ceo of hume i 'm gonna throw to you first um thanks yeah this was such an interesting question and bernadette to her credit gave us some advance notice and i 'm grateful for that because it really got me thinking and to me personally there 's some synergies between the climate change issue and gender equality if i think about climate change and some of the early data science that 's 50 years old of when we first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started and yet it 's taken 50 years before it feels like we 're seeing the evidence and going oh we 'd better do something and it 's almost too late now and i feel like not to say it 's too late on gender equality but it feels like obviously for many many years women the suffragettes have been working on women 's equality but 50 years ago there was a major revolution and yet it feels like it 's new now and that we 're seeing the impacts of the inaction because family violence we understand the impacts of family violence the entrenched disadvantage of women the lack of women in power the lack of women 's financial security the impacts of the pandemic so it 's the burning platform and so that for me is what it means to me it 's that that that link between we 've had this long history and we 're suddenly perhaps finally got that catalyst for really being prepared to make a a brave difference um so that 's what it means for me great thank you let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think it all starts from the beginning and i believe education is that part where we can really sow those seeds um 50 years is a lot of time 50 years is like you know a person 's lifespan but if the things have changed so slowly how can they be fast-tracked so bringing that education right into the new generation from the beginning is so important my children only knew that yes my mom 's got an environmental academic degree but what she does she does volunteering she does you know she does a lot of other things but is it really important that for your children to to kind of give you that respect my mom 's a manager or my mum it it seems like teenage girls really take it very hard on them when they don 't see them others do to positions where um some other peer you know friends are so um whatever we 're doing if we 're proud of it and we we bring that thing right from the beginning into children 's mindset i believe that 's important so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community gap i loved volunteering i love my community and i love education so i think what bernadette 's put through is that i think that stem catalyst is a byproduct of my community passion and my passion towards education so i see a lot of women who 've stood up we 've taken parental breaks have now stood up to say can i come and support i 'm happy to volunteer for stem catalyst and um it looks like they get a vision of what it looks like to be acknowledged into their own families into their own circle so yes that 's that 's for me um the meaning of you know finding your true self thank you thank you thanks and sally judge um well you asked what does it mean for me personally it 's always very hard to separate the personal from the professional and i 've dedicated my career to working in public service uh so thinking about um the role that arch talks about and and i 'm the chief executive of a vocational education institute at kangan here near in broad meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about empowering women i think through empowerment uh we can create uh well through equality and empowerment we can create a platform for people to have a voice on environmental issues and i think education is the key back to archer 's original point thank you and probably just picking up on your point education and that sense of belonging that um you know maybe arch can comment on that that sense of belonging say through something like enviro champions program that that people actually uh find they find their buddies and the people who talk the same green language and um you know they feel at home in that space so exactly yeah and if i wouldn 't have had that support i had the project right up to my sleeve but i wasn 't sure i was like um maybe i 'm i should be really thinking about something critical about environment what 's the burning issue you know people always talk about a little ways this but what what 's really and um probably halfway down when i met mel um melissa doherty um and uh she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your sleeve you know you that 's what you 're passionate about go for it and if i haven 't had that coffee catch up with um with with the person you know who 's re who really believes in your potential um mentorship and you know that these connections are so important because sometimes you feel yourself you 're bounded you 're bounded by your family life you 're bounded by circumstances or system but um yeah it 's not like that and thank you for making all those you know opportunities for especially women who really want to work in women 's spaces and yeah it 's it 's a great opportunity for everyone in the community everyone 's welcome so great job hub you know coordinators and council well done give yourself a pat on the back everyone who that 's involved in that um so let 's um let 's kind of move a little bit along that space so as we know australia has experienced a series of climate related disasters floods floods at the moment fires recently as well as the covered pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what did you notice about how women responded to these emergencies and this is a two-parter i apologize is there something special about the resilience of women in the way that they respond to these things so would anyone like to go first i um i 've got a little note on that because i really want you to nail that thing um all right preparation i 've got dr kayden she 's from rmit university and um her research is about making those coatings those ceramic coatings that 's installed in the houses that um that makes it bushfire resistant so um for me that stood out yes um you know our country is prone which was uh an annual um you know thing that happened so how do women um take that um so apart from having the research in human health and um natural uh disasters and stuff like that i think one of the best thing that i that really stood out for me was kate negan 's research on it and it has got a lot um it 's still in the pilot phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm really glad that she 's taken that first step great sally i 'll probably add um perhaps not so much about uh the the impact of the pandemic on women and what we found in vocational education is that uh women were disproportionately affected by the pandemic so displaced through their work and we were delighted uh when government made particular decisions policy changes to ensure that tafe was accessible to women to young people and others that were disproportionately affected so some of you might have heard of free tafe that 's one of the government policies and they reduced uh oh well they increase the eligibility for women so women could access free tape so i think those sorts of initiatives so polity policy shifts of government the other one i wanted to call out only because sonia talked about it and the importance of people learning english and i was once told when i started this role is that we teach more people english in broad meadows at our campus than anywhere else in the state so we 're delighted that we do that and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government this time for those people who have arrived in australia there 's a particular limit where your hours to learn english run out and so the government removed that barrier so we had people returning to learn english through the pandemic coup perhaps have been here for a decade so making a difference to people obviously is what we want to do and i think that 's what tafe did really well through the pandemic and january i know you 've you 've been to one of our um i think you 've been to one of our ercs no recovery centers yes something yeah yes yes yeah i was going to reflect on that so um it 's just a personal observation when i started we were in the hard lockdown got out for all of five days and then we were back in a hard lockdown and in our vaccine i will call it a crisis at the time you 'd remember in hume and my observations of that time is so many women that i was working with behind the scenes we had some fantastic advocacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior parts of departments managers our pandemic response team was majority women just getting on with it and you asked about something special and i don 't know if it 's special or it 's the overdone strength but my observation is women have an overdone strength of being able to just get on with it and not seek acknowledgement or accolades or recognition for the work they do it 's just well this is my job and i 'm just going to get on with it and that 's i saw that time and again in that space and i would say you know sally ring me early up just going what do you need because you know we 've got buses i hope you don 't mind mentioning that you know it 's like we 've got this carly who 's our three-time mayor and just does the job gets on with it doesn 't seek accolades um our local member put me in contact with the female head of a secretary who rang me just went what do you need um and that might have happened otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say i reckon women have an overdone strength of just we just get on with it and i say overdone deliberately because it can hold us back and we don 't feel comfortable saying actually you know what i 'm nailing it i 'm doing a really good job and i 'm going to push myself forward it 's not a space we 're comfortable with and i think we heard that a bit with sonia earlier just going i wanted to be on the board but i didn 't see myself as the president so yeah yeah i agree let 's go to that i 'm going to skip a question and i 'll come back to it because i want to pick up on that point because i i i picked that up also from um so i usually said she 's one of four out of 18 uh only four female presidents out of 18 and she didn 't see herself so i 'm just wondering from the three of you whether uh you know you 're all ceos um whether you you had the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go first i can see sally and sheena stop looking i think we 're fan girling over arch we want to hear what you think maybe sheena why don 't you go first since you kind of picked up did i no not no um not actively you know is that something from my career yes i 'm going to be a ceo and i 've been in rooms in leadership programs where you can see um there will be and it is men i 've sat with and clearly have got a path that says i 'm going to do this and then i 'm going to do this and i 'm planning to be a ceo and i 'm going to move around and because i 'm chasing the ceo job and that 's just not been how i thought about myself but at the point where i was ready to apply for this role because i was looking for a job and i had men and women who supported me going i 'm i want a ceo role so it was deliberate that 's the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was but is it has it always been part of my design no yeah okay so it 's a it 's a timing issue perhaps it 's a timing issue for some people um i mean you 're running your own business so it 's absolutely the same with me i always wanted to be um you know a person who 's shoulder to shoulder not not someone who 's standing above them but i think sometimes there are opportunities that if you stand up maybe that leads the way something that 's not already carved so in my niche i would say i haven 't seen a muslim woman standing up for her if there is no career pathways and people easily give up i have been a chair of my early speaking women 's community group for almost five years um i joined as a member i did things as a leader and then i was pushed down to the president role and i 've i felt a little bit daunted that um you know there are women in the group already much more obviously i felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role but when i was pushed and when i was um sort of given that responsibility um the the thing took such a turn that kovid was here people were disconnected they didn 't had opportunities to connect and everyone was feeling really overwhelmed and through that phase of two years when when the board took the the group to the next level um it it just all of a sudden everyone started talking about their passion and they 've started their own um little things doing along with someone started a northern women 's badminton group that was first of its kind in victoria uh some started there are in catering uh classes and stuff like that so it was all of a sudden it felt like you know that the the energy in the room was changed and yes it is um i believe it is really important that um what we 're passionate about and we stand for it um leads the way and sometimes it 's a rocky road it isn 't easy for stem catalysts to to to progress um when it comes to funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive of women so i 'm really glad that we were able to not just in victoria across what is able to form those connections where people see value in the work and they 're really there to support great thank you and sally so talking about pathway to chief executive yeah well i didn 't even know you could be a chief executive honestly i grew up in a small country town my parents were public servants my dad was a police officer and my mum was a carer i didn 't know about feminism they didn 't teach that certainly at school sonia was talking about aboriginal history well you certainly didn 't learn about feminism so i think probably my experience has been to to have a crack to focus on having an impact at the biggest possible scale that you can and um probably a bit like sonia i feel like organizations chose me before i chose them or thought that i would in fact become a chief executive and what i probably have loved most in my career is to help others and grow others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about and you know listening to others today i get so much more out of it than speaking myself um so i think it 's yeah organizations and others sort of help show you what you can become yeah and i love that point you 've just made that sonja also made and probably sheena as well just around other people noticing that it 's your turn and kind of coming to you to let you know and i know that the two of you are doing it is doing it in her group it 's really important i think to to make sure that we don 't um get in the way of people but we 're actually giving them a leg up so all right let 's move on to the next question so since 2018 we 've seen young women lead global conversations and actions about a whole range of issues so on climate we 've seen greta turnburg in the school strikes for climate which is in australia at least as large have been driven by young women on human rights we 've seen malala yousafzai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse and we 've seen grace tame our former australian of the year leave those conversations so my question is what can we learn from these young women and other young women about how to change the gender agenda yep sally you have to go first this time yes i 'm thinking about people who um have had a big impact and and perhaps given uh the terrible floods that are occurring uh in northern new south wales and queensland at the moment and uh the black saturday um buyers and thinking about what that um sorry i 've just missed the question yeah sorry so what can we learn from the young women about i was thinking about who 's had a big impact here in australia and who are the women who have stood up almost into their power and and the one that came to mind is celeste barber and i don 't know if anyone knows who celeste is so so she is someone who is on the social media platforms on instagram and twitter and she parodies other people most often women um to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created this huge international following and post uh the fires that occurred was last year the year before in new south wales she did it set up a gofundme and i think originally her goal was something like 50 000 it was this very small thing and she thought i might be able to get 50 000 to help support the local cfa and i think ultimately it was something like 30 million dollars yeah it was enormous that she generated so i think part of the message in that is i don 't think we almost know our power as women and i think she certainly learned it uh through that process and um yeah my just encouragement is if people want to have an impact putting yourself out there or starting a movement is what starting to make a big difference i think thanks let 's go to you actually we 'll go we 'll this time yeah for me um grace teams um you know coming up as a noise was really touching um because what i felt was there 's so much bias workplaces as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not just cultural but it 's global um and maybe for a time being things go down and things don 't come up but when it 's the right time justice always prevails and you know i feel like um i don 't want to comment more on that because it 's such a um you know close to heart thing that the data is you know very um i would say my my heart just goes out um with that out of nine um ten out of you know nine women are so much affected by by those things so um grace times um thing really touched me thanks um i guess i would say i take great heart in it um it 's and i we talked right at the start about climate change and the history and where we are now and i probably take great heart in and i 'll use this word deliberately how impolite women can be about not being happy with where they 're at and i actually think that 's progress that we don 't have to apologize or be sugarcoating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough and they 're speaking so bluntly and plainly and bringing voice and i think there 's a lot of heart so i hope it continues that we just have a really honest conversation um around these things in australia particularly i saw i mean or i think sort of that plain speaking plain language there 's nowhere to hide from this is um a welcome addition to the commentary yeah yeah i would absolutely agree with that yeah it 's been great to see them so let 's give them all a clap that 's right so let 's move on to another young-ish woman she 's younger than me anyway um she 's jacinda ardern who 's the of course the new zealand prime minister so i 'll just read out a quote from her and then i 'll ask a question so she says one of the criticisms i 've faced over the years is that i 'm not aggressive enough or assertive enough or maybe somehow because i 'm empathetic it means i 'm weak i totally rebel against that i refuse to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen examples in the last couple of weeks of what a non-empathetic and non-compassionate world leader looks like it 's playing out on our screens every day but it also plays out as you know perhaps um sonia alluded to a place out in a sport as well and it probably plays out in the local government sector and other community sectors too so how do we break the bias against this aggressive leadership style being the norm oh sally i saw that europe i think i think it probably cuts both ways though and and if we think about um perhaps the comment that we 're making about grace tame she might otherwise be seen as that aggressive or assertive leadership style and and i think we do need to recognize particularly for women that our leadership styles come in all forms and and i don 't think there 's a right or wrong way for it to come about i think we obviously need to lead from the front and uh lead with our values as um as best we can so i probably um and i understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 've walked into almost in every job that i 've been in particularly management roles in fact in every instance i think when i became a manager i was the only female in a male room and and always in those instances worked to shift the culture and i would also say in that in equally i had this amazing opportunity uh to work with an executive where the majority was female young went up early in my career and so i always knew that cultures could be different and that they didn 't need to be that sort of you talk about aggressive but it 's particularly competitive i would say and you can shift it and so i guess i 've always worked to try and shift and break down that competitive aggressive style yeah gina oh yep we 're jumping over we 're not going in order keeping us on our toes um yeah look it is about the culture piece and i think that 's that 's absolutely true sally 's absolutely right it 's the culture piece and it 's having the conversations about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we talk about with what you admire about what we all we many of us probably admire about jacinda are doing is the empathy piece that would have been termed soft skills yeah that language has pretty much disappeared now um which is a really healthy thing to see and that shows you how it 's shifted it 's not seen as a soft skill it 's actually just being a decent human being um and that is a valid leadership quality in a normal workplace um and so it 's about having that conversation and building the culture so and it 's it 's striking that balance you know we 're in the shift there have been really competitive cultures in the past and i 've worked in those really competitive cultures and you want to you still need to get things done so it 's not um all sweetness and light and overdone empathy but how do you have robust conversations but you 're still empathetic kind and can get things done and that 's a cultural conversation um so i i welcome the fact we no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique to women that we bring because i don 't believe that i actually think there are many men and i 've worked with many men who actually quite like being able to tap into an empathetic side and understand that you can have a really productive high functioning culture where you 're bringing your whole self into work yeah great i think pretty much i agree with both sheena and sally and that yes um it it is um i felt when i came as a migrant from my own culture i felt like it 's only predominant in my culture and that that that comes up as um male dominance um but it 's it 's not it 's it 's actually um in every culture that yeah that we we need to break the bias um through things simple things you know with even with education you know maths and engineering being my most boys subjects whereas you know science and life sciences and medical degrees being girls um choices um that that has um blurred um that that understanding has blurred in the past eight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes down to to really to that family level and to the understanding if we as mothers can bring that change in our children when they talk when when children talk in their own um circles may even the story books the cartoons that they watch that there 's so much bias in it that um they 're really knowingly unknowingly girls really got somewhere in the back of their mind that they can 't take those brave actions but um yeah that then again i would say it 's now taking the step for a sustainable tomorrow great thank you we need some we do need some more um female superheroes i think um there are a few more but we need a few more yep all right so we 've got about enough time for two questions i think so um as leaders in your each of your organizations how do you ensure that women 's voices are heard um and are you do you see yourselves as role models for gender equality i might start perhaps one of the first things i did when i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gender pay gap in the organization so that was the first thing and and i think um that perhaps tells you a lot about uh the sort of equity that i was wanting to create in the organization uh we have an organization that 's about 57 female we have 57 this is true in management roles and we have about slightly more on the executive team so our females are represented right through the organization proportionately so i think we 're going in the right direction we still have a i think it 's 5.7 uh gender pay gap so we are working to close that uh it 's much better than the average of 23 and much better than the public sector average of 10 but again it 's not enough so we 'll be working really hard to ensure that in the first instance the pay gap is uh doesn 't exist any further good work um so for me role model yes um you have to be uh it 's that 's what comes with the territory so um and really it 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been endorsed we 're coming from like looking at our structure plan in terms of leadership there are not enough women in leadership at hume i 've got 7 out of 26 if i 'm still if i 'm here in 12 months time and i 'm still saying that 7 out of 26 i shouldn 't have a job um because it 's not good enough and there needs to be more women it 's um that 's my commitment and that 's what we need to do as part of our gender equality action plan and being very intentional so we 've committed to there 's a lot of actions committed to but it is you know that first point around data that sally is talking you can 't hide from the data i mentioned you know brittany higgins and grace tamed him there 's nowhere to hide some of this started there 's nowhere to hide from it you either do it or you don 't um and being very intentional um about how we try and seek women 's voices and i don 't have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm hearing from sonia and arj about the women we don 't see and hear from and how do you make sure you 're um really trying to get those voices as well not just people right in front of me so that 's that 's an action i 'm taking away and pondering more out of this so thanks so if there 's any hume uh staff in the room at lunch time you know who to talk to and arch yeah what 's your reflections we are women 's we were a women 's family organisation we still are um the other two girls who joined their expertise to form stem catalysts have now stepped into full-time roles with great organizations so i see that um that their parenting gap of 10-15 years we 're in this platform act as a sort of trampoline for them to kind of jump and take that leap um my other co-founder just had a baby and she wasn 't thinking of going back to work so i believe that you know the experience and the internship that she received through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third partner as well so what 's the next step for me is to bring on board those women in the community who are really passionate about what they have taken their education careers but coming to australia have lost you know way to go back and i think the most easiest industry um don 't get offended i 'm sorry but um the most easiest thing to step in is like a child care educator people from medical backgrounds and you know higher degrees tertiary educated women for the sake of supporting their livelihood have entered a child care industry and um because because of those things i feel like we 're really losing the good skill set um in the community so um i have now decided that i 'm taking that transformation from having a for-profit partnership business into a social enterprise and um there are when i opened when when the group split up um for good reasons when the group came to um just played last june i i opened it up for the community i have a small platform of around 100 families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions ongoing so we have been through the pandemic we have been offering free of course sessions um to to children um to engage them in hands-on science so i say that there were so many women who have raised hand that they want to be a part of it they just want to be acknowledged that they do doing something meaningful and adding on to the community so i believe that 's that 's the next step that um i 'm i 'm still um in a very infantry mode myself but i 'm there to support great sounds really exciting actually and probably goes back to a couple of those things that sonja said i wrote them down about connection engagement inclusion participation empowerment and belonging you know you 're offering all of those things obviously through through your um your business okay so the last question uh for today is um from julia gillard our former prime minister she has a podcast um that she call it 's called a podcast of one 's own based on some quote from um i 've got a now forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just forgotten her name she 's an author she 's not alive anymore um oh god that 's gonna stop me no she 's english she drowned herself with the things in her pockets virginia woof thank yous i should have written that down shouldn 't i i thought i had it up here anyway so so she and when she interviews um she interviews women mostly women but sometimes men on this podcast if you 've heard it it 's pretty good if you haven 't heard it um and at the end she always asks her guess this question so thank you julia gillard so if you had all the power in the world to change one thing for women what would it be education hands down easily obviously as a chief executive of a vocational education institute but um there is someone in the uh crowd here anka i don 't know where ankara is here she is she talked to me about the value of her education so and particularly learning english at kangan institute so i think you said that created all of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent [Applause] yeah i can 't i can 't write a war you know vote more for anything than education um it is my spiritual right it is my um you know birth right so um and it changes um once you have knowledge um the perspective change um so i i can 't vote for anything and if i had all the power and um you know the capacity that i could um i would certainly put that into its education and gina you 're going to go in the interest of just being different because you can 't actually argue with that but if i could magic wanders the caring professions would not be the lowest paid professions in australia oh yes [Applause] all right so if you can pick up your magic wand on the way out and we 'll fix those couple of things um that 's the end of our panel session today so if you can put your hands together again for our three panels sally arjun and sheena thank you so much for sharing your thoughts with us today so firstly let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you for leaving that discussion bernadette uh excuse me um and to each of our panelists i 'd like to thank you for spending international women 's day with us here in hume city and thank you very much for uh sharing your insights with us i think everybody in this room would have absolutely enjoyed hearing from all of you so it was our absolute pleasure thank you for being here [Applause] so after i handed out those flowers i 'm so um graciously last time the team have come to help me um present them so thank you very much they 're beautiful again but i i did want to acknowledge hume city council for this amazing event and the flowers as we arrived just took my breath away that that and and how they 've got it all set up so just amazing to hume city council thank you and bernadette also for you [Applause] so before we finish up with the formalities and we are just about done i wanted to leave you with a couple of thoughts um from me personally um so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age but it was a very long time ago at the time i was in high school my name was kylie nunn i 've been married but my my surname then was none i was quite a smart young lady and i was achieving really good results i i worked really hard and i liked to do well at the end of year 12 my maths methods teacher wrote a poem to celebrate the end of the year so something that he did every single year for the year 12 class some of the things in the poem were quite funny some of them told the story of the year that we 'd had as a class but what mr curry wrote about me he said this if anyone was sure to succeed a name related to maths could be done so when we asked the gradient of a turning point the answer is obviously none so for anybody who 's not an a maths nerd and i assume that not everybody remembers year 12 math methods and that the gradient of a turning point is none there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of me telling you this is that my mathematics teacher thought that i would succeed and over 25 years later i still think of that i can recite exactly what he said in that poem 25 years ago um a couple of years ago that same teacher contacted me um in my capacity as mayor he was having some issues with a toilet that was being built in a park near his property and he wanted to speak to me about that he had no idea about what he had said in that poem absolutely no idea about what he had written about me but i can still recite that that absolute verse i can recite every word of it so the point of me telling you this today is part of my final comments is that sometimes you can be a bit oblivious to the impact that you might be having on somebody else but it really doesn 't take a lot to build somebody else up so really what i just want to leave you with today is let 's celebrate each other let 's encourage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bias so thank you everybody for attending today so for those of you who are here in person i now ask you to join us in the foyer for some lunch uh for everybody who 's joined us online today uh thank you for tuning in we hope that you have enjoyed your time with us and happy international women 's day to you all thank you everybody [Applause] you,"(-37.6819035, 144.9179152)"

3047, Australia",2813,hello i 'm christy and in 2019 i completed the free human viral champs training program once i had children i became fully aware of the real issues facing our future generations and i wanted to raise my kids with sustainable habits and an appreciation for our valuable resources [Music] signing up to the hume enviro champs program was a really exciting next step this was the beginning of my journey to help my family and community take positive action towards living more sustainably the program has 10 sessions and topics cover project planning leadership communities change makers communication resourcing volunteering building relationships in the community and there 's also support with ongoing project development it was wonderful to meet like-minded local people and share our ideas and concerns around environmental issues what i enjoyed most about the program was that it allowed me to channel my energy and create and take meaningful action personally i think this is the best solution towards feeling overwhelmed by our the current problems in the world and our need to act more quickly on climate change the project i decided to plan with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own market garden and she 's become concerned about the increasing amount of genetically modified crops our communities are consuming she 's passionate about reconnecting people with their food and showing them the power of growing their own heirloom varieties at home we were both concerned about how much food growing and seed saving knowledge has been lost throughout our community ever since modern society has allowed us to outsource these and many other skills that were once handed down from one generation to the next strengthening those communities we believed that starting a seed library would build community resilience and food security in the city of hume once i finished the program my mind was bubbling with ideas on other ways i could become more sustainable i became really curious about permaculture principles how they could help us with the seed library and also food security for my own family so at that point i decided to apply for a human environmental scholarship to help fund my permaculture design certificate since then i 've helped to develop other sustainability initiatives in my local sunbury community including the olive grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunbury neighborhood house an open access indigenous and productive front garden but don 't just take my word for how great the program is let 's hear from some of the other champs i 'm elizabeth from summary and my project is about wasting less in our households one of the things i 'm trying to do is work on a list of places and businesses in sunbury that offer bring your own containers and ways to not actually get waste for your household i 've created a facebook page called wasteless heroes where people can share ideas and information about local initiatives to be more responsible with our waste it 's a way for people to share how to recycle difficult objects and initiatives in the local area that help people to get rid of waste not in their landfill bin but in responsible ways everyone my name is basha atta and i live in sunbury i chose my project as spaven lake sunbury environmental news because i 'm very passionate about the lake my aim is to share all the environmental uh information with the community and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uh the lake and and its animals and its plant life sort of water quality uh feeding ducks bread which is not not good and we try to emphasize that point and find alternatives and have a clean tidy environment for all to live and enjoy people can can get involved in my project by accessing my facebook page we can interact together with with the community and hopefully come up with some ideas for improvement i thoroughly enjoyed the programme because it challenged me it challenged me in a way that i had to choose my own project and i had to find out what was i really passionate about if you you 're passionate i would highly recommend the course because it will teach you how to promote and to interact with hopefully find like-minded people so yeah you can come together and and discuss and promote your environmental subject hello my name 's cassie i 'm from craig yeah so i 'm pretty happy i joined the enviro champion program i 'm really happy i have some excursions like going to the nuke and the organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area and i 'm also really happy to see a lot of people and share ideas i 'm a little bit environmental focused person i really pay attention to how much raise how much waste we generate and how the waste is going to i also like to make some of the ways into something that is useful in my home when i since i was very little i think i 'm still exploring opportunities how can i participate in terms of ways and recycling and also the hume as a circular economicity i really enjoy sharing ideas and meeting people in discussion and also some of the online events if you are really got a project or something you really want to change and i think i think the invol champion program will be a better program it will be a good program for you to participate and meet people who can and find some people who can support you and also attending some of the events you will know some people and probably they will give you some advice and support in terms of what you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city area so my name is harsh imran and i did my enviro champions program in back in 2020. my project is basically called growing an urban jungle although it sounds very similar to you know revegetating a patch of land but it 's but it is different than uh a convention and plantation that we do across you know hume and other local government areas so um the the revegetation project that i have is based upon a technique called miyabaki which is the brainchild of a japanese botanist akira miyawaki so what it aims to do is you know build up dense forested areas of land which would serve as you know habitat for birds and bees and insects also the principles of this project is that it uses native vegetation to vegetate that batch of land the project is based in malcolm creek in gregory burn therein we got you know we worked with the parks department to accrue a land of 100 metres square and then we you know went ahead with vegetating that patch so currently um how they could find me is you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uh the planting day we haven 't really gone ahead you know with uh you know on contacting people because the patch is still developing once it develops i think it would be a a great um you know visually a great uh green green site for people or the community members to look at but we haven 't really gone into contacting people at this point of time because we have enough members to look after the patch of life once is once it is developed i think we are looking for more connects if you come across a program such as enviro champions i think go ahead you know give it a go and that 's that would be your core starting point so i would definitely you know um advise you to go ahead with such programs whenever and wherever you could find any and make a start with you know however little or big you the id the project idea that you have just just give it a go my name is ashel i 've been a resident of mikalam since may 2020 so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as my project i am coordinating a strategic alliance building project as part of the group and the aim of this project is to foster working relationships with other groups or individuals i 'm taking action in hume the best part about the program for me was to meet like-minded people especially those who didn 't know how to implement a community project because i felt the same and it was good to meet others who have the same dedication and motivation to help make hume a sustainable place for the members who are interested in taking action i would tell them not to be hesitant or be scared even if you don 't know where to start or how you can implement actions for me joining the hume enviro champions group program is a good start because as part of the program you get support throughout and even when the program has ended you still get support from the coordinators of the program and either they can support your project directly or they can they can point you in the right direction it presents the opportunity for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champs or even people in the community who 's not part of the program but who 's willing to collaborate and take action to make um hume a sustainable area for people in the community who wants to get involved there is a dedicated email for the group so it 's hume climate gmail.com and we also have a dedicated facebook page and it 's called hume climate action now which you can use as well to send us a message and then we 'll respond back to you my name is kev sardone and i 'm living in rockstar park i attend to 2019 emerge embodies championship program of whom my a project called k4363064 is a postcode of the um rockstar park i used to go that park very often and i see that lots of people are dropping rubbish and i thought it 's simple but it 's something to contribute to my caring for environment having these people around and doing something for community was so good and exciting i learned lots of things first of all you know meeting all these same minded people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing something seeing that actually before that i was thinking of you i 'm just by myself i 'm the only one caring for environment but it wasn 't like that actually and it gives me hope big hope and encouraged me to do something more you know if you care for environment it 's me you caring for future and we have only one planet to care you know and we should have some responsibility we should own the problem and do something for it don 't think of it 's big or small you know i struggle sometimes you know what i 'm doing why i 'm doing you know is it my responsible to take the rubbish from road i have a facebook page called k43064 people can message me from that web page um face page it 's important to showing your care for environment you know simple but important effect hi my name 's sharon together with my mum maureen and my husband roger we participated in the 2020 hume environmental champs program and our project is called my healthy street and the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat healthier and to reduce waste in the environment we 're both from um greenville and from craigieburn so we brought neighbours together and as a group we were able to purchase wholesale fruit and vegetables organic and also they 're from local farmers so there 's less food miles which is environmentally friendly and also less packaging so every fortnight we come together and put together a an organic fruit and veg box being part of the hume environmental champions program gave me confidence and it gave me motivation to keep going with my idea and explore ideas about how we could make hume more environmentally friendly it was also great to meet other people who were passionate about hume and caring about hume 's environment so if you 've got an idea about being kinder in our hume community or if you haven 't got an idea i 'd encourage you to join the enviro champs project because it will support hume to be more environmentally friendly we welcome new members to come along members of the community we 're based in greenvale so if you 're interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in touch with us through facebook and instagram at my healthy street [Music] my name 's joe russell i my project is bush tucker and fibre garden up at the indigenous community garden at west meadows i 'm a hume resident i have worked with the enviro champs for the last almost seven years just doing bush tucker walks and talks tours when i started i had no idea what i wanted to do but my passion was always to be able to create a bushtaker garden like i have one at home but i wanted the one that i could use for the community just to educate people on the importance of buchitaka the importance of why we use some plants to for weaving i 've started a cooking demonstration so that 's going to be part of my project champs was a wonderful thing to do especially meeting people that are you know environmental have concerns the same as i do and yeah people that want to care for land care for country well i have a facebook page

's just a really good project to get involved you know so yeah i encourage people to do it my name 's leslie kubalski i live in west meadows i 'm a hume resident i 've been part of the enviro champs program 2021 my project 's called nature in the park and it aims to the target audience a new migrants people who don 't know too much about nature and wildlife in the area and who 'd be interested in getting out into the parks finding out about birds and plants and things like that so i think it 's such a nice thing to get in touch with the local wildlife i think it helps you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature a little bit and we all know how beneficial that 's been through lockdown i think it does give you some sort of comfort and make the environment champs program the first portal call because um it helps you helps you to focus on what your strengths are and what your interests are it 's just a great program meeting people like-minded people really nice people that you almost immediately feel at home with it 's just such a relief to meet people who think the same issue and i love nature and that i found that with all the participants they 're welcome to email me on my email is leslie

scene draws us away from the attention-grabbing digital world and reconnects us with nature [Music] i 'm jackie blight i 'm one of the 10 artists selected for the sunbury cultural commissions project [Music] i chose the evan street wildflower grasslands as my subject jackie participated in the creative public art labs which was run by rmit cast and through this mentorship program she developed her research that was instigated from this photograph that she found in the archives jackie blight as an artist demonstrates a meticulous attention to detail in her work she 's got a really keen eye for natural form and a real focus on the natural environment it 's a testament to the strength of jackie 's professionalism and her art practice that she was actually the selected artist i started sifting through photos from the george evans museum collection and came across an image of the grasslands from the 90s i felt a pang of guilt i 'd lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them so i immediately rushed out to remedy that by taking a long walk in the grass there 's not a lot of grasslands like evan street left i always called this one of the jewels in the crown in a healthy grassland you could have 10 15 20 different species of grass 50 100 different species of forbs and wildflowers it 's a species-rich community and this few little hectares here in the middle of sunbury is an example of what would have once spread across the landscape so what was 2.3 million hectares in 2009 there was 15 000 hectares left grasslands are the world 's most endangered ecosystem [Music] i 've driven past and like most people they see it as a paddock the only way to really understand the grasslands is to picture yourself write down is a marsupial mouse or something and that 's when you start to understand the complexity of it and you realize it 's sort of a bit like the amazon only on a tiny scale grasslands uh a smaller version of an old growth forest some of these grasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just doesn 't get the same attention that was one thing that 's opened my eyes little bit how important and how special these grasslands are and how important it is to conserve we 've got some species that were here pre-settlement fast forward one year my passion for the grasslands has grown i have visited them dozens of times photographing the plants speaking to the experts from council and the community learning to identify and remove weeds watching the cultural burning practices and witnessing the resulting reinvigoration of the forbes and grasses we 've been using prescribed birds to manage the grassland for at least 15 years it does stimulate the seed in the soil to go predominantly he 's getting rid of what we call the biomass and then generally once the soil is open there 's bit of moisture it 's just the heat from the sun generated in the soil and that 's when things germinate [Music] where we 're sitting now is an education source it 's a classroom as it would have been for our ancestors [Music] it 's about learning to observe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch it 's actually learning to walk with fire one of the things that we learn about indigenous burning it 's not burning for our safety it 's burning for the safety of everything that lives within the system that you 're burning so you 're burning for the birds you 're burning for the trees you 're burning for the grasses but you 're also burning for the reptiles and the mammals you 're actually burning for the worms and the ants and the insects the pollinators that rely on these grasslands for their survival [Music] each time i visit i discover something new i 've now seen the four seasons and the life cycle of hundreds of plants from first leaves to floating seeds i 'm using the monong seed as the motif for my work i 've chosen this motif for a number of reasons firstly to pay tribute to our first nations people who cared for and live sustainably on these lands for many thousands of years secondly seeds are symbolic a seed is the embodiment of the past present and future stored within its dna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations to flourish jackie 's work float is definitely a big departure from what she normally creates in her practice it 's a large free hanging sculpture that will be suspended in the foyer of the space visitors really have the opportunity to experience it in a very bodily way because we 're kind of looking up at it we 're watching it subtly move i can imagine myself lying back on this couch and just kind of really ruminating on this work as people enter their eyes are drawn upwards to a sea of floating murnong seeds moving slowly overhead [Music] we hope to print them in an eco-friendly material a mixture of recycled wood and bioplastic made from corn making it a renewable and 100 compostable component jackie 's work speaks really clearly to a number of the goals in hume 's art in public places policy in that it is really strongly site-specific and has strong long-lasting connections to community [Music] nature is the most important thing on the planet apart from the love that we have and the connection that we have with each other as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is uncover what is there in a grassland so you 're discovering it and then how do we preserve it for our future generations not only for our community but for all australians really anything to draw a different light on grasslands and the importance to conserve grasslands i think is vitally important i would really like to see the evan street grasslands connected via a green corridor all the way to the oregon pipes national park that would be i 'd be so wrapped if that would happen and i think it 's possible you,"(-37.6819035, 144.9179152)"

and we 're really proud of what they 've achieved so far we are particularly pleased with the progress of the stolen generation marker project thank you for joining us online today please visit councils website to find out more about the online activities that we have planned for reconciliation week thank you [Music] reconciliation week is important to me because it helps us to remember the past the future and helps us to connect with the different ancestors from Australia through the Aboriginal people and the toast Rhode Islanders as an early childhood educator this is a vital time as it helps us to help children learn about the past and Aboriginal people and the connection they have with the land each day we try to help children learn about their environment growing respect for children and for families and for the whole community this is a vital time for children they will become our future leaders so we need to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with in our lands but myself personally I feel like this is a time for connection from the past to the future there is a big gap between Australian and Aboriginal people and we need to try and close this we can do this through connecting and being together I feel like as a person and as a member of society it is my job to be respectful to help build connections and to care for the environment like an Aboriginal people did reconciliation is important to me because it 's about connecting it 's about coming together and acknowledging First Nation people of this country between the people in the culture and the spirit of it all and once we can do that we can get over bridges and Connect communities reconciliation week is important to me because we need to learn about and acknowledge the in justices of the past to walk together reconciliation week is important to me because it 's about indigenous and non-indigenous people coming together learning and sharing and taking that walk together with in the world reconciliation is important to me as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wider Australians it is about working collaborative together to improve better outcomes for our people [Music] hey slicks on right there 's a healing thing for my brother Wally Arden and myself but also to pay respect and homage to my free Arnie mums who bought us up in a dear old birth mother never got to see till I was 30 years

three sister [Music] I see that you I feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay a fee Oh drop your watts [Music] [Applause] in another life [Music] you hi my name is Melissa I work for Hume City Council as the urban biodiversity officer and reconciliation week is really important for me because I love nature and to me when I think about all of the different Aboriginal cultures that have lived across the huge stretch of Victoria let alone the rest of Australia they relied purely on nature for all of their food fiber medicine and tools and I think we 've just all had a recent experience when we went to the shopping centre and we couldn 't buy the food and things that we needed because of the pandemic and the buying out so for Aboriginal people to have to rely on nature for everything that they needed and they 've lived on this country for hundreds of thousands of years and they looked after country really well so that is really important to me that the plants and animals are appreciated and valued and cared for and in return nature provides everything that we need to survive as well so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their connection to country and I think from a reconciliation point of view that 's something that every Australian should be able to take away is this appreciation for nature and how important it is so I 'm proud to be an Australian and I 'm proud to share this country with lots of other cultures and I 'm really proud of the Aboriginal history that we have here in Australia so happy reconciliation week hello my name is Brian Cameron Molly Cameron is my original birth name I 'm part of Stalin Jen and I was adopted into a family and took on the morally surname reconciliation to me means that everybody in the country working together for a common good I think that was one of the keys to the success and longevity of the old people of this land was that they worked for the common good everybody working together I think we 've lost a little bit in that regard in our modern world but it 's not too late and the way the world 's going at the moment we need to work together we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards a better future reconciliation week is important to me because it allows a particularly intimate time to reflect on where we 're at as a nation as the so called Australian nation for non-indigenous and indigenous people to come together and share stories and heal a little bit more every year like the trauma that we 've experienced in this country of genocide and with with that much pain and hurt and the Stolen Generation and and the continued impact of of mining and fossil fuel extraction on Aboriginal land there 's it 's always an important time to come together and hear each other and hear each other in ways that aren 't just for the sake of listening but for the sake of action and what does reconciliation look like and to me there 's a number of things what that looks like for me it 's acknowledging my own whiteness and my own Aboriginal originality and coming to a real peace with those identities within me it also means that for for me and non-indigenous people to work together there 's more education for non-indigenous folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work together and enjoy our lives in a more harmonious way and the only way we can do that is through continuing to tell our stories as First Nations people what our stories are and what our stories have been in the past and the stories of our hopes for the future reconciliation is important to me as a non Aboriginal person because I 've benefited from the dispossession of Aboriginal people and I 've learned of the pain caused over many centuries and it 's our responsibility to do what we can to make amends for this and to work in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people towards a fairer world and we do this in the spirit of reconciliation reconciliation week is important to me because it 's a time for us to heal our indigenous heritage and respect our Aboriginal people by building positive relationships with them [Music] [Music] [Music] you you [Music] you,"(-37.6819035, 144.9179152)"

cultures as a vital part of australia 's identity and recognizes celebrates and pays respect to the existing family members of the laundry world elders past present and future so we are excited today to have chris uh in the studio hume studios we 're looking at uh well having a chat with him about his art practice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of one of your first big shows in public would that be right uh yeah that 's uh correct and um yeah i just want to say uh thank you for having me on uh and uh meeting you this year and uh yeah we 're pretty excited and i i can 't wait to see how they all look in the space because they 're they 're drawn on this beautiful kind of uh opaque card and they they have an informality to them so we 're going to uh rather than frame them we 're going to hang them across the wall like a we call the salon hang they sometimes do in the gallery so it 's going to be beautiful anyway but but so today 's today 's chat we 're having a discussion around uh really what why you make art i guess so i 've got a series of questions and um yeah let 's start with what what inspires you to draw do you think what what is it that makes you want to draw um what what uh inspires me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just nature itself you know like just looking at trees and uh just just being uh spiritual and in a sense of um connecting with nature and you know with animals uh just breathing and you know and uh uh just being around uh positive people as well you know they have the sort of uh same sort of interests of me and but most importantly what inspires me is my friends and my family so it 's what makes them make me feel to uh to be better yeah to inspire me yeah and it 's really great as a as a maker to be supported by your family yeah to have to have people value what you 're doing because there 's i think history is littered with stories of people who wanted to be artists whose families went oh well that 's not a good career you 've got to be a doctor or you know how are you going to earn a living doing that all that sort of stuff yeah right that people encourage your creativity yeah yeah so i try to like kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know like i mean i gotta understand their own perspectives you know what they what they think you know but i just tend to not to you know take it on board too much and uh you know get turned down for what i feel that i think is right in my own sort of uh desires yeah so yeah it 's so great i think and what about i know your work is so fine i know when i first saw the imagery such detail with the color and they really are what i call most photo realist they 're almost very true to life so i wonder what it is what is it that you love that you enjoy about the actual act of drawing itself like the the mechanical like do you get lost in it when you 're doing it how does it would you just tend to sit down and just make one image from go to whoa or do you start and stop how does it work uh okay so basically when i when i draw um i usually start my it depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know really motivated and enthused about uh how i connect with the drawing and specifically with the subject that i 'm drawing um i usually you know go through like a full five hours or three hours you know but i mean sometimes like if i need to stop i 'll take breaks in between those in that sort of period of time um so i can you know take a probably a five minute break you know or i stop what i 'm doing and i just go do another activity or uh watch a movie and then just kind of just relax because sometimes i don 't like to uh ever think too much or put too much pressure to myself because then it 's like i lose the focus on uh uh listening like learning more you know and seeing where i can fix up my mistakes or what i did but uh yeah so basically my my work is like photo reference so i like um i get lost and i focus on like too much detail and i just love you know learning and experimenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that how that animal looks like in up close you know and that kind of it really fascinates me and then that 's where i can learn on my drawing as well so in time later on in the future you know i can say oh yeah i remember how hell that specific animal looks like in that sort of uh uh way when it 's you know i don 't know however it is you know sometimes i do to take track of time when i 'm doing my my drawings uh sometimes i do lose track and then i look at the time of oh geez well it 's already like you know uh such and such time you know and but i mean it 's it 's it 's like it helps me get through the day and it helps me stay calm and uh relaxed so like it helped me kind of look forward to having a good sleep because i i 'm using my brain so much you know and um yeah but sometimes if i feel like i 'm just kind of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have some coffee or some chocolate or just some snack or something and then uh yeah and maybe sometimes i just talk a little bit of exercise you know when i learn how to make sure my brain 's uh up to speed and focused you know so so yeah it 's just like it 's all about balance you know for me so when it comes to my drawings yeah yeah tell us about the uh the pencils and the paper like the brands that you like using is it have you did you take a while to discover your favorite materials or was they you know did you learn that from other people or had had you come to the materials that you like to use um well as i started when i 've started to become more better about all my drawings i found i wanted to um well i started off with uh these like normal faber-castell pencils just the standard ones and then um i was just kind of curious you know to see what um what what other options that i have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i thought i 'd check out what that what else they got along with every other brand that i 've i 'm using now and i want to see what 's what 's their strengths and their weaknesses and what 's the results when it comes to um drawing and so yeah basically i use um as i mentioned faber castell pencils but i use specific ones they 're called polychromos so they 're like a hard base lead pencil and yeah they 're quite good so i 've been using them for about uh three years now and i also use a prismacolor prismacolor pencils they 're like a wax based pencil so they 're a bit more softer compared to faber-castell polychromos and the when i found out with the prismacolors uh i realized how much good they really look you know when it comes to blending in and you know with colors and i did my research more and more on that and i 've seen i went into like instagram and um other websites and see how other artists you know do their work with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinated and i was like in so much uh um excitement you 'd say well that 's this is really cool you know i thought i 'd you know buy something you know go for it and experiment on them you know and yeah and then along down the track you know i saw uh another artist you know using different kinds of pencils and then i 'm like whoa what are these you know and this is they just seem so so unreal you know and these ones are this kind of pencils i 'm talking about they 're called um luminance uh sorry caran dash luminance pencils they 're swedish and yeah and they 've like they come out very very beautiful you know they 're quite similar to uh the prismacolor pencils where they blend in very well and so yeah so basically there 's all those pencils that i use as i said i like to balance you know so and whatever i feel i 'll use whatever i want there to make to meet my expectations you know my results yeah do you can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in from overseas getting through the local art shop with something that 's a bit uh with the fabric uh it depends on which ones i 'm looking for um the the caran dash luminance pencils they 're basically from overseas and they 're excuse me they 're uh one of the they 're one of the most expensive top of the range pencils so uh they 're a bit more pricier than the other two brands that i use but basically yeah um faber castells and the prisoners i can get them local and yeah the karen dash luminance pencils are overseas so but for me i personally like to buy them online because then uh i find them better and much more convenient to buy bulk than to buy uh singulars but uh yeah i wondered to when um you said you worked from photos quite a lot like do you do you work in this particular place like you 're always inside or do you ever do you ever go outside to work or what how 's this kind of studio set up um well basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoors so inside uh in the house um so i prefer to be inside because um i feel much more in my comfort zone so it 's like my little comfort bubble so you know even though i got like noise in in the background i 've got people talking and doing their own thing uh it 's kind of i 'm kind of i 'm quite used to it you know because i 've been doing it for so long it 's just like a natural thing for me to hurt to happen so um but i mean i 've tried outdoors but i don 't know it just seemed too strange but i mean even though it it was kind of nice to try it out you know to sit out uh with nature and you know resolve the vibe and you know appreciate the serenity of it you know but um yeah no i prefer to have it my way of being at home and do my work so yeah yeah you go go to work where you comfy i know it 's like like cooking you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i wanted to um i know um you were mentored by another local artist uh in in your work when you were just thinking about a show um did you want to talk about that experience of being having someone support your work um in that mental role yeah uh when i this is like an unexpected feeling i didn 't expect it when i happened to uh catch up with gail uh who 's my mentor uh for me experiencing and feeling that it was i was like i was so happy you know like my spirit you know in my heart i felt in my heart it was just like a really good feeling you know like a sense of like you know wow you know i appreciate you know and i feel blessed you know for someone to you know recognize my talent and truly believe in me and you know and uh now you can actually help me you know and i mean it 's not so much of a personal gain for me but i mean it 's like a sense of that you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is it 's just a sense that you know it 's just something that i 've always wanted you know so yeah you know so it 's very very i think other um have like gail humphries you know she 's she 's an artist but some people might know in hume too because she 's had uh some exhibitions herself i think she does some sort of wire work and she was in i think the first exhibition we had in the new sunbury global learning center there and she i guess we 're feeling she 's been on quite a journey herself you know over time so it it gives her a lot of knowledge and experience to them yeah support you it 's great it 's you never know who 's going to support your work and it 's often quite surprising these people come out and it 's not necessarily your family or even your friends it can be someone yeah yeah you meet by chance who kind of recognizes something in you or your work and says hey that 's really worth doing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to the show in sunbury um you know scaled up too into murals or something i 've just sort of had it we 've got a bit of uh we have a few public art programming hume and i i think we 'll be doing murals into the future and who knows okay cool yeah all right who knows where it could be yeah yeah i think um i was gonna ask you i suppose yeah just one final question about what what you 'd like to get out of um if you like what this exhibition like did you have expectations about having a show it 's been a really unusual year and you 've been quite patient through the process of putting a show online and then now we are able to hang it as well it 's been a bit of a journey but what what are you hoping might come out of um from my expectations you know i mean i 'm learning not to have too much or high expectations but um the most common and simple expectations i want is just you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own personal feedback and their constructive criticism you know for my work and uh have my my mom my my family and my friends there that truly you know supported and you know uh appreciate me as a person you know and in my work and just be there for me and you know that 's all that matters to me you know but um on the other side of that is i 'm hoping that some people are willing to you know buy my work and you know just a sign of appreciation and you know yeah yeah people people will probably see on the website if they 're looking at this interview that there 's the link to your contact details so even after the show is shut um it 'd be fine to send you an email if someone is interested in your in your work and are you on facebook or instagram or any of the social media channels as well oh yeah i 've got uh i 've got instagram and facebook so yeah wow but with my instagram page it 's mainly focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than me as a person posting photos of myself but uh yeah but i mean there 's quite a few there 's like a few photos of myself that uh majority of the uh the materials all on my artwork so uh with facebook uh it 's basically a mix of you know but i put my work on my facebook as well so i thought this is a bit of a left field question but when i was looking at all your work while we were uploading images i was wondering if any of those animals or birds or insects if you felt you had a personal affinity with any of them like is there you know people talk about having a totem oh yeah something that like oh there 's a little bit of me in the whatever okay yeah um from what i can think of at the moment is probably the the the ringtailed lemon monkey yeah yeah yeah and um another one would be probably the uh the orange butterfly i don 't know why they did it yeah i just find it really interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh is is just one of many moments of transformation in your work and uh we 're pretty excited to be getting it up on the walls i think but once it 's in the space should be up until the 13th of december so yes i think so much for being part of the process and if you if you had any messages for young aspiring artists out there who are in you know grade 6 or year 7 or what would you say to them say that follow your hearts and do what you do that you love you know and be yourself yeah be humble as well yes live words right from chris ellsberg also i just like to say uh to for gail to uh thank you uh and for investing your time and effort and uh helping me get my artwork out there and uh sorry to say thank you anna as well for uh helping me yeah for your hard work and effort so yeah i appreciate it so well that 's what we 're here for we 're very excited to support arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thanks for the chat please and um we 'll hopefully see you okay all right all right thank you you,"(-37.6819035, 144.9179152)"

father an indigenous christian assyrian came to australia as a refugee fleeing persecution suffered by our family and people in iraq when he got his first job on the production line at the ford motor company 's broad meadows plant he could scarcely have imagined that one day his son would become the mayor of the city which gave him a start in this new land of opportunity australia it is this very freedom to pursue opportunity that has made australia the promised land for generations of migrants thousands of whom have started their life here in hume in this role i will support and champion australian values like mutual respect tolerance compassion for those in need and equality of opportunity those who know me well know that my interest in public service and politics has always been up been rooted in my upbringing and values these include fairness justice and support for the vulnerable in my life family faith and community have been seminal in my inaugural speech to council in 2017 i spoke about the importance of service to one 's family community and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and those values remain as important to me today i believe strongly counsellors in servant leadership and the positive role that young people can have in government we i think must address the apathy that many young people today feel about government and politics to quote pericles just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn 't mean politics won 't take an interest in you this council has now produced the youngest mayor in hume history in former count former mayor and councillor casey nunn and now the second youngest by 20 months and the youngest male mayor i hope that these milestones will encourage young people in hume to get involved in leadership in politics and government and affirm that through public service you can make a meaningful and positive contribution and impact on your community our city councillors has suffered greatly as a result of the covert one nine pandemic and this council will need to play an active role in the recovery as mayor i will work with my colleagues to prioritize supporting businesses to recover reopen and rebuild over the next 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shovel ready projects to build new community infrastructure including new or upgraded sporting reserves parks and playgrounds roads and footpaths and new community centres a record 443 million dollars will be invested over the next four years for more than five hundred projects these works will help create hundreds of jobs that the hume community needs we will also ensure that we advocate strongly to the victorian and commonwealth governments for funding of projects including the redevelopment of the broad meadows railway station the duplication of mikulum

unflinching love and support and for teaching me that the simple satisfaction derived from community service is the greatest reward one can have he has given four decades in service of the community and is a wonderful role model thank you dad for imparting to me what is really of value and meaning to my mother georgia a great inspiration to me in my life she is the hardest working and most selfless person i know and has put her children and family ahead of anything for as long as i can remember without your sacrifices i wouldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the person i am today thank you mum to my grandmother julia widowed in her 40s and arriving in australia with nine children not a word of english or knowing a single person she persevered to give her family a good life i 've never heard her mutter a single word of complaint about the cards life delta and i can 't imagine how people in this current point in history could have coped with all the struggles that she has and remain so positive she 's the strongest woman i know and of course to my wife and best friend sheena who has supported me in every endeavor i have embarked upon if i can purloin the terminology of her own legal profession she is my general counsel senior advisor campaign manager and giver of inspiration and love she has been right beside me throughout my council campaigns and worked as hard as i have being a partner to those in public life means much sacrifice and in this case being away from your husband for meeting and community event after meeting and community event sheena will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time both excited to support me and to put up with me over the next 12 months i really regret that my family and the families and loved ones of all of you our counsellors could not be here with us this evening due to the covert restrictions but i hope we can make it up to them at some point in the future councillors i 'm told i have a reputation for verbosity indeed my wife frequently reminds people that her husband has never been known to be short of an opinion that being said this year i will listen more than i will speak if anything council meetings should i hope proved to be much shorter without my general business items and deep analysis of council reports and documents and i can see councillor medcraft nodding i 'm sure the re-elected councils will be devastated to miss out on these contributions but i promise i 'll bring them back along with my general business items in year two rest assured you won 't hear a speech as long as this one for at least 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge my duties as stipulated in the local government act and i intend to do so carefully with the support of you as colleagues and our experienced and passionate council staff led by the ceo mr isola now it 's time to get to work and deliver for the people of hume thank you councillors it is customary to allow um in the statutory meeting the opportunity for councillors to make some remarks and so i provide that opportunity to those who would like to speak and i can see my colleague counsellor more motioning to me councillor moore thank you very much mr may it 's actually quite a novelty to be able to say that to someone mr mayor but mr mayor a very big congratulations to you on your election as mayor having served our community together for the previous four years i am confident that our city is in very safe hands you work hard you are always well prepared you are very accessible and responsive to our community and you always have something to contribute to every single discussion you have provided strong leadership and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate about like reducing gambling harm council 's indented parking bay policy and your anti-infringement stance your position on these issues is something that many members of our community already know about you and i 'm sure that that played a role in your re-election but tonight i want to share some things with our community that they may not know about you it is time for our community to get to know their new mayor a little better so as you said tonight at age 31 you become hume 's second youngest ever mayor but this will not come as a surprise to your high school friends as they thought you were always destined for a career in politics i 'm told that at your year 12 graduation you were voted the most likely to become prime minister by your fellow students and growing up your family and community had expected that you would either be a politician or maybe even a priest as you are always very interested in both religion and politics anybody who has tuned into a council meeting or attended a council meeting will know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the propensity for long speeches although i 'm surprised tonight wasn 't quite as long as i was expecting this was always going to be the case as you were a debating champion and president of your student representative council during high school and i 've certainly seen these debating skills first hand on many occasions joseph you have strong values based on fairness social justice compassion equality of opportunity and support for the most vulnerable in our community it is these values that saw you receive a premier 's award for multicultural excellence for championing diversity and inclusion at the age of just 23 from being involved in community work with youth programs activities that support seniors and advocacy on human rights or quietly and privately supporting refugees and new arrivals or helping to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to help victims of war conflict and displacement it is your genuine desire to help others that will see you lead our community with both passion and compassion on congratulating you mr may i also want to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate your wife sheena over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you and i 'm sure that this will continue it is really unfortunate that sheena and your wider family can 't be here tonight to celebrate this occasion but i 'm sure that sheena and your parents jacob and georgia and your brother benjamin are at home watching this evening with great pride lastly i want to thank and congratulate my fellow councillors being chosen to represent your community is an enormous honour and as i pledge to support you mr mayor i also commit to working with all of my fellow councillors to serve and deliver for the human community thank you thank you very much councillor moore and i 'm i 'm truly humbled by by your words and i don 't know where you got all of those details sheena must have had something to do with it thank you once again is there another counselor who would like to address us this evening councillor sherry thank you mr mayor i congratulate councillor joseph harwill on his election as mayor for the first year of the new term of council in 2021 i have got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated that he works not only for his ward but for the whole of hume has evidenced by his advocacy not only for aitken ward but also for residents of other parts of this city i 'm looking forward to working with him on the product projects that we are both passionate about such as the redevelopment of seabrook reserve broad meadows and work on more community facilities such as in valley park and in dallas i am also certain that joseph will join other councillors and i looking for improvements to city amenity in older parts of the city as well as new as he understands how run-down physical environments or lack of facilities contribute to inequality thank you thank you very much councillor sherry for your kindness and um you and i are very much aligned on many policy issues and have been for some time and and i particularly want to recognize your contribution as deputy mayor in the last year especially during some difficult times with the pandemic thank you very much is there any other counselor bell is uh motion motioning counselor bell turn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your elevation to this important position i 'm sure this is a moment of personal pride and achievement for you one shared by your family friends and supporters who i 'm sure are watching us tonight on the live stream but in your election i also note the seriousness of the moment that we as a city and a broader community face challenges the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetime demanding of us swiftness of action a depth of compassion and a unity of purpose these trials require sound and steady leadership a confident hand to help guide us and our city through these murky waters in you mr mayor i believe we have found that hand i look forward to working with this council under your leadership to make real and lasting differences to the lives of all who call our city home this moment demands of us nothing less tonight like you four years ago i find myself attending my first council meeting the good people of jackson 's creek ward have seen me fit to be one of their representatives for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust their hope and their endorsement of my positive vision for our community for investment in community facilities action on fixing our struggling infrastructure and real changes that will make life just that little bit easier i intend over these next four years to repay that trust and working with you all to keep my word and follow through with my commitments and at all times working hard to make not only my community but our entire city an even better place to live work and grow up congratulations again mr mayor you have a big task ahead of you however i 'm unendingly confident that you are most definitely up to the challenge thank you thank

to set for the future that when young and diverse faces put their hand up to lead we are prepared to give them a go this year or this first year undoubtedly we 'll have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

are issues they want this council to address and i look forward to working with you mr mayor and council in making them a priority as i look across this room tonight i am buoyed with energy and hope with what we can achieve this term of council i think the community has chosen wisely and my congratulations goes to every candidate in the room who is successful and probably in particular in the

Broadmeadows VIC 3047, Australia",10057,welcome everyone to hume council 's session creativity equals brain gym uh we 're pretty excited this is a uh i think our second uh recorded seminar for the hume galleries program and this one 's been organized to coincide with an exhibition by ellie louise tychon called release the show in a in a non-covered world would have happened at the sunbury global learning center but instead we have the exhibition virtually on a site called the exhibit so i 'll mention that again at the end of the session but where we 're really excited to see all the uh the interest in the session and uh it 's a it 's a beautiful thing to be exploring together so to today i 'd just like to start with our the hume acknowledgement of country so hugh city council recognises the rich aboriginal heritage within the municipality and acknowledges the waiwaram which includes the gunnam willem bullock clan as the traditional custodians of this land council embraces aboriginal and torres strait islander living cultures as a vital part of australian identity and recognizes celebrates and pays tribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elders past present and future i 'd also like to thank uh in advance our speakers today we have our artist and curator ellie louise icon so maybe you can wave when when i read i think everyone hopefully everyone can see your names anyway uh artists uh craig even artistic elena ashley who is a composer and a student of psychodrama and we have um matthew gleason matt gleason from sunbury community health who for some reason i 've lost on my screen i hope you 're still there man i 'm still here sorry it 's a computer it might be me on my phone that 's cool so yeah community partnership and engagement officer and tania vergona who is a professional art psychotherapist and somatic experienced practitioner you might explain that along the way tanya and clinical supervisor so thank you for our speakers today yes so i i just wanted to start with a quote actually so i 'm i 'm anna club and i work in community development in the arts and culture team at home and usually i work out of the sunbury gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful that it will be opening up again soon uh but i wanted to i 'll be moderator for today so i 'll be asking a series of questions to ask speakers and we 'd love you to to listen to what the speakers have to say but then feel free to raise your hand or comment if you 'd like along the way we 'll see how that goes uh i wanted to start with a quote by um a hungarian psychologist called mahali i think his surname maybe tanya knows about him but he wrote a book in 1990 called flow the psychology of optimal experience and i think in a way that 's what this session is really about it 's about how you really people become really involved in something and that has a benefit for their brain so this author said this is a quote from him the best moments in our lives are not the passive receptive relaxing times the best moments are usually occur if a person 's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite later if it 's relevant and at the end of um this session too we will uh ask anyone to put their emails into the chat and if you want we 've got a post event information kit that we can send out to you with a whole lot of references thanks uh okay so we might start our uh forum questions uh i think ellie louise we might ask your first question i think we 're just gonna start in a way that uh each speaker will kick off and if you as i said if you 're happy to just let our four speakers have their say first then come in if you like you can turn your video on or off it 's really up to you so our first question is what sparks creative action for you uh we 'll ask that of um ellie would you like to kick off yeah um i guess for me it 's a couple of things um so inspiration and emotional states are probably the two main things that spark my creative action um in terms of emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to my art practice as a way of coping when i 'm feeling overwhelmed with i guess all sorts of emotions just in response to daily living um so it kind of assists me in expelling that energy in making soft sculptures and weaving um it 's kind of a rhythmic process that i 'm engaging in which gives me a sense of calm most of the time um not always but most of the time i tend to come out of a session of making feeling a lot more like i 've got a grasp on how i 'm feeling um yeah and then in terms of inspiration i guess um i draw upon a lot of sources in terms of online like instagram and pinterest looking at um other people 's work i guess other artists and other weavers um and yeah looking at the textures and colors that they use in their work will then usually inspire me to create something as well yeah yeah beautiful yeah i hope people have time to look at ellie 's exhibition online because it 's really really beautiful um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of playfulness in her work i think yeah thanks anna yeah would would any um the rest of you guys like to have some words on that i i can kind of um continue on with with that in a way because it 's very close to how art therapy works i guess you know it 's a self-regulating way of um yeah just finding some level of of calm or a way to be with those emotions i know for me nature is definitely my inspiration i 've always witne in in a relationship with it where i can witness it and i use natural objects or i represent natural objects and kind of distort them a little bit and make somehow it relevant to maybe how i might be perceiving things and i find that that um i i like collecting lots of natural objects like i 've got like plan drawers with lots of shelves and things that i 've collected on my walks and things like that and um pull them together and it 's very much an organizing principle for me like i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one another and and that communication that co that relationship is what sparks my interest definitely and it 's like an organizing aspect of myself yeah i guess the thing for me too is about being in the moment so as a photographer who mainly works with other performers what sparks my creativity is other people 's performance or other people 's art so i mainly photograph bands um but also theater and sometimes paintings and stuff like that as well but as a photographer it 's a moment in time and and so i have to be really present um and you know we know through the lessons of things like strategies like mindfulness that being in in the moment can be really helpful to people 's mental health it also brings me in contact with other people so you know it really it 's other people and other people 's performance that sparks my my creativity what about you elena um well that 's really interesting question i mean for me creativity that that 's some kind of state where um i might initiate at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something that would wake it up or i might be spontaneously um awakened by my creativity so it 's like um one would be that i am in the role of the initiator of my creativity another one would be another role of something that initiates me so the role of creativity which is very very it 's quite mysterious experience and that might attend me basically in any place at any particular moment um difficult to describe how that 's happening definitely something to do with my brain activity the next question i might direct to tanya initially is how do you manage your time to make space for creative work because when you try and balance it with work paid work uh or other work so yeah how do you deal with time management for creative work oh yeah god that 's a big one um you know over the period of my creative life it 's um you know it was always just kind of making art but now i you know creativity could be in a range of things like cooking or gardening or um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meets maybe what i need at the time like i 've just been doing a lot of mandalas recently but i i wouldn 't say that that 's a normal part of my artistic practice um but just something that i 've been engaged in creatively and i think at the moment i 'm just kind of taking whatever moment there is and understanding that it 's kind of creativity in all moments that there 's that possibility there um but you know coming from art school and and moving into that space i always had a difficult time balancing time money and space you know i either had time and no money or or i didn 't have the space or one of those things just never seemed to match up um but somehow i always did find the time um because it really was a fundamental need of mine and it 's become really my life you know creativity has become my life so it might not always be an artwork now or in a body of work which you know having come from artwork art school but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make art as in a body of work um so i kind of feel happy about that because it feels a bit um liberating in that way um yeah so i would say just you know seeing that as a possibility in all moments um you know as possibility creativity as um what 's possible and having that as a perspective um and that that one artwork doesn 't have to hold everything i think just kind of surrendering that it 's it 's it 's an artwork in that time for what 's needed in that moment yeah that 's very philosophical probably has to be right now when i i think about time for some reason i think about matt taking photographs of punk musicians late at night after he 's worked all day at sunbury community health and i wonder how that goes how do you how do you deal with it matt uh very poorly uh it 's definitely time consuming uh and it 's not just the last nights it 's editing and stuff like that too like i could spend three hours at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sorting through photos and editing and publishing uh you know what we know about the arts is that um there 's very few artists out there that can earn a living purely from their art um and so by necessity they have to have another job uh and so that can be can be quite difficult to balance um and if you 're really passionate about like i can get lost in a wormhole i um you know i 've warned friends and family all the time that you know i can get lost in an editing wormhole for six eight hours um and that can get out of balance at times so that 's one of the things as a practitioner both interested in mental health but also i have to kind of be mindful of that and keep on top of balancing things up yeah yeah for sure but nappy napping 's also always really good too when you can get a chance that 's cool um does it said was really refreshing as i guess i would call myself an emerging artist coming from art school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as creativity in all outlets because i think art school has a very structured way of teaching you how to be creative so it 's good to come out of that and hear people talk about how they 've applied that in their life and balancing work do you have a particular space that inspires you to be creative and i think yeah matt i wondered if you had some thoughts about that um when you 're in your house like where where is it um within my house i can work anywhere yeah you know my cheap tools are a camera and a laptop so they pretty much just come everywhere with me uh editing i 'll just corner up yeah corner of the lounge room will do i tend to just kind of zone out everything else that 's kind of going on around me anyway when i 'm doing that um but in terms of capturing images um this the special spaces are obviously live music venues um performance spaces um but also the streets um and abandoned spaces so there 's something a bit um poignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time or has been left empty um and quite often you 'll walk into those spaces and it 's like somebody left last month and you know you 've you 'll find somebody 's dinner plate or whatever and there 's some real stories to be told out of that um but yeah in terms of actual process uh i don 't know i 've worked at the back of a bar editing photos while the shows have gone on um in an effort to get photos out in a timely manner so yeah i don 't need a quiet or or sacred space for my work yeah what what about you tanya how do you go yeah i know i need a quiet space definitely and it 's interesting to hear how different that is because you know you 're going into other people 's spaces and and um like you 're the observer of that space and i feel like for me it 's like i need time i need to be able to hear myself or hear you know what 's um wanting to emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship between things so it 's like if i have too much going on in the background or if i 've got my own script going around what i have to do um it just kind of doesn 't you know nothing i have to create the space i have to create the right conditions like when you 're growing a plant you know you 've got to put the right things in the soil to make it grow so you know studio space is always it doesn 't have to be a studio space it just has to be a a quiet space and it has to feel like mine not someone else 's you know or i remember going and um making artworks in in people 's homes in these remote places because i always love to go somewhere you know in nature and do residencies and things like that and i it that 's okay as long as i can make it my own you know spread out and kind of make it my own but um yeah there 's definitely something about my space but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe i always had this fantasy that i would kind of have a studio and just have my bed and my kitchen just part of the studio like it wouldn 't be separate you know but now the family and everything it 's quite different but yeah i always just imagine that that 's actually how things would be so i could have this ongoing relationship with my artwork but um yeah it doesn 't have to be a big space it just has to be kind of myspace where there 's enough quietness for me to want to exist and contemplate i used to rent a studio and found that i hated going to these shared studios because there was no light there was always yeah it was just an awful place to really exist laughing there i just had a very similar experience oh yeah it hasn 't been a sense of home doesn 't it yeah i rented a space for and it was i was only there for six months but it was very there was too much going on and like it just didn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on how you work yeah just feeling comfortable um everyone was friendly that was in the rest of the spaces but it was just the environment was too i guess dingy is the word for it um so i 'm much happier i 've got my own space now but i relate to tanyarin that it has to feel like your own to feel to let the creativity come um because i find if i 'm uncomfortable i can 't i can 't make it just doesn 't i could but i guess the quality wouldn 't be probably what i would like can i just add to that a brief statement about creativity is doing as opposed to being lucky in a state of like creativity comes from a state of being not from the state of doing for me and i and that 's why the space you know has to be a place to hold that sense of being yeah so do you when you 're um when you 're working with your clients with your therapist hash on is that something you communicate to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of creating some space yeah yes yes yeah um a place to be is very important as opposed to do and that 's why the the studio and the space and the conditions even in the relationship between me and that person um has to feel safe and create the conditions for that to happen definitely anyway yes well yes welcome to the everyone on the call i said i 've always find a little strange hosting when you can 't see faces but um that 's that 's our world now uh so our next question uh which i think is for you initially ellie is do you involve others in your creativity or is it usually primarily a sort of solo activity um for me um for me it 's mainly by myself i guess sometimes i 'm drawing inspiration from other conversations with people um talking about struggles and things they might be going through which is kind of prominent at the moment um but yeah i 'm mainly working by myself um i just haven 't really found someone to collaborate with i guess that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the working together part especially in making something um but i 've definitely worked with other people in terms of um i guess installing my work which is often good because others will give you a different approach to how you might present something which will change how it 's viewed well i don 't know elena because you 're i think psycho drama is by nature collaborative isn 't it maybe you 'd like to explain a little bit about what 's what psychodrama is potential well psychodrama this is a the therapeutic creative method which is applicable to the groups to the group work in the group of people or on individual basis face to face and that 's basically the work that whereas the one of the main aspects is to see yourself through the reflection in others which is done by playing out the range of roles that you could be in or invite other people to be in those roles and using different techniques like for example reversing those roles to find or to see the reflections that are happening at that moment it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example i imagine myself a flower and let 's say i invite ellie to be elena and then as a flower i 'm gonna talk to ellie as elena and then i 'm gonna reverse froze with ellie ellie is gonna become the flower i 'm gonna be the elena and ellie 's gonna deliver to me the message things like that might might sound a little bit complicated but um uh psycho drama triggers imagination and spontaneous response to whatever situation you know we might work on and yeah that 's very much about the group as well so other people are invited and we we can just um what i like in psychodrama there is such uh such an instrument that is called concretization for example we might decide that today we 're gonna choose a little object to that will be symbolizing today what has happened today or how i feel today and then we might just choose this object and just share a little bit about it and present it to everyone and even that sharing about this little representation of ourselves in that particular day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be awakened it sounds like you 'll be very vulnerable often in that it 's it 's one thing to perform together you know in a theatrical way but to then have a psychological dimension to it which is very personal as well must be very intense i 'd imagine it might be at times but also it can be a for example if you don 't want to be that vulnerable you can say i i don 't want to be vulnerable today and here you are in your role of not be willing to be vulnerable and we can look at it as well if you wish for example so that 's these are the all the different sorts of possibilities around the rules that we might play out in the moment or for example i resist i don 't care you know i don 't like you or i don 't like what you 're talking about here okay let 's choose someone to be that role and let 's have a look on it okay you 're the opposition has has anyone else in the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or martial yeah do you want to share it 's very powerful yes it 's very powerful my modality yeah and it gets things happening very quickly and i actually yeah um yeah i i found it confronting but but at the same time uh very good yeah okay well perhaps we can um share some resources about that in our intro if people are interested to look into it more because there 's there 's a a basin center in melbourne i think here or well the place where i study is called psychodrama institute of melbourne well at the moment it 's closed but if you go and google they 've got their website where you can read the information and um sorry elena i had a lag there yeah yeah yeah you didn 't matt you said did you you 've had experience too have you with yeah elena and i have a mentor in common um who has been a practitioner of psychodrama for quite a long time and i 've had an off and on relationship with sue over most of my career actually and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in terms of my professional work but also in terms of personal insights you know the reality is that when as individuals we 're not one thing there 's a whole bunch of roles sitting underneath the surface and exploring how they kind of contribute to the way that we carry our way out ourselves through our life can be can provide some incredible insights do you think you work with young people quite a lot do you think it 's a technique that would be particularly useful for younger people given that often they 're a bit more well i 'm they 're introverts and extroverts but often young people were quite drawn to those intense i mean look i 'm i 'm not a prank i have to be really clear i 'm not a practitioner of psychodrama um but i 've worked alongside practitioners um and there are a number of kind of creative modalities that are used with um young people so um kind of play therapy um like a drama um art therapy range of different kind of creative pursuits that can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening for them uh and sometimes that could happen in a really non-threatening way so i remember doing some training work a number of years ago with a youth drug and alcohol rehab up in canberra and they used to use play a fair bit with adolescents that were attending that centre and it was a really kind of non-threatening way for young people to kind of explore what was what was occurring for them um so yeah it 's it 's a number of kind of creative modalities can have use with young people yeah incredibly effective yeah this question i think this is initially addressed to you matt but and this is ellie 's question actually i remember so you might like to explain your question because tanya and i were talking about this one because i think this is a tricky one our question is do you think the arts industry is less forgiving of mental health challenges than it is of physical or psychological issues so that 's a little a little bit of a complicated question but matt just um i work predominantly with nighttime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is a higher prevalence of mental health issues and mental health disorders amongst people that work in that industry and that 'll be for a variety of reasons for example we also know that anybody that 's working night shift for example is going to be more prone or more vulnerable to experiencing some mental health issues during the course of their lifetime because sleep deprivation is incredibly bad for your mental health what i have found working with the live music industry in particular is that compared to other industries um they are reasonably forgiving of and i actually don 't like the term forgiving they 're reasonably accepting of the fact that people may experience some mental health problems along the way having said that um you know that 's just one subset of the community and there 's still it 's still an industry that is um subjected to all the kind of community norms and what our community norms say is that um if you have a visible physical illness then you 're generally going to have that more accepted than say if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that i do is i 'm a facilitator of the mental health first aid training and we 've trained a number of community members over the last couple of years around sunbury to be mental health first aiders and what i would love to see is that um in workplaces and community mental health first aid gets the same kind of acceptance as physical first aid because the reality is i break my leg tomorrow people are going to ask me you know what 's happened there 's going to be a lot of care shown and all of that but if i 'm experiencing depression i might get the same kind of responses from my workplace from community or indeed from family members that 's that 's so true i remember in fact i neglected to to mention in the introduction that this session has been organized for mental oh that 's my bad but i i remember hearing patrick mcgorry who who won the australian of the year a few years ago now he 's a mental health expert and i remember hearing him talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if people could start to talk and think about mental health as part of physical health like it 's just it 's another aspect of a person 's normal health profile so and in any one life we can all expect to have an episode of mental health ill health as well as physical health it 's very normal it 's part of part of our rural health program i thought he 's um i think he helped set up the origin centers is that right yes he did um right if you think about it this way one in five australians will experience some kind of mental health issue diagnosable um in the next 12 months we can 't say that one in five australians will have a broken leg in the in the next 12 months so that 's how common it really is within our community and so yes there is done around identifying and recognizing that and accepting it we 've got a question in the chat here from sabrina saying how can we make mindfulness part of every day so we don 't forget has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i can touch on that a little bit if you like um i found sort of an avenue in that um from dealing with grief and processing that mindfulness helps me escape from those feelings and i 've kind of found it through exercise but kind of a softer exercise through um body balance it 's like a mix of pilates and yoga and mindfulness meditation um so i tend to do um they 're like hour-long classes where at the end there 's about a 10-minute long meditation which i use as mindfulness um so i do exercises in that where i visualize different things that will help me cope i guess that day for a long time it was daily that i was doing that whereas now it 's probably three times a week but those those moment that 10 minutes is so important um so i guess in terms of not forgetting um i guess that 's kind of to do with scheduling with me sometimes it 's i have to write it down um that i 'm going to do that today um and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting the pressure on to do it every day as well may work for some people not making it too much of a task you can make it really small by just attaching it to a daily practice like drinking a glass of water for example so just making that commitment that when you have a glass of water i 'm you know i 'm just going to be there and present for drinking a glass of water and that can be a really good kind of starting point in terms of mindfulness practice um because hopefully we 're all drinking water every day um and it 's something that we don 't have to schedule in yeah actually we had a young girl working in our office when i first started who had an app on her phone that reminded her to drink water because she said she was someone who just didn 't for some reason she didn 't have the normal thirst triggers so that 's the weirdest thing i 've ever heard but that that 's you 're so right um man and there 's there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that can help with um mindfulness there 's a smart the smiling mind i think is is a really good one with i think there 's the international one calm um the resilient mind is something we 've been using recently but i don 't know tanya do you have any comments there about well yeah there 's quite a few comments i can make but i mean i think the act of making if you 're engaging any kind of creativity i feel like that 's a very mindful act in itself um but also um connecting uh to your senses and orienting to the here and now through your senses um any time like just kind of what matt was saying really um but you can do it through your sound and and touch and vision and and taste um and that 's always available to you and i guess it is about just shifting your attention to that mindful state um and deciding that that 's something that we need to become aware of or that 's a practice that we 're going to choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know and understand you know what our quality of presence might be at any given time um but bringing it back to the body i find it to be a safe way and a simple way and a pleasurable way to do it um and we don 't have to go anywhere to do it sometimes um yeah so the sense is definitely yeah use what you have yeah yes what about you elena do you have something you want to add there yeah i was um basically when we 're doing something from our routine if you change the nappy for your baby or you 're peeling potato or your washing dishes it 's just about again to bring attention fully towards what you 're doing at the moment and just to let yourself slow down a little bit and really be be fully there in what you 're doing at the moment rather than doing something and being constantly occupied with a stream of thoughts and thinking about okay all right next i 'm gonna i have to do this and this and this and that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by concentrating on exactly the thing that you 're doing at the moment you might start noticing just let yourself notice the details that are happening you might notice that your baby need you know needs uh another size of the nappy or maybe the dishes um you might notice a beautiful flower on your plate you know or you might um notice any other details and that sort of is going to slow down your mind and bring your attention towards what 's happening in the moment and that also brings that kind of mindful state mindful so your mind is full and by um when you bring your attention towards what you 're doing at the moment and there is no actual uh certain particular need to go and um remind yourself of constant you know uh exercise or on a daily basis so that might make your day a little bit easier in that sense we we 've got a couple of questions left and i might i might skip to one that uh we might ask you first ellie are there times when creativity doesn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there barriers or are there barriers that can sometimes stop you being creative i guess like a bad shared studio from what you said that didn 't smell good but okay yeah that 's a good example yeah my other one would be to do with time management um as a barrier because i 'm one that 's fills my day with probably too much which i think i 'm getting better at as i get older but um it 's definitely a barrier for me is going okay i 'll do all this housework and then i 'll get to my studio and then it 's p.m and i can 't be bothered about it um so i 'm trying to get better at that through scheduling um but yeah i find i 've got at the moment especially i 've got my toes in a lot of different areas um to in a sense to fund my creative practice so i 'm finding a little bit hard to find time which is funny and ironic because we 're supposed to have all his free time and covered um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah it 's definitely the time management and work and then things like what tanya was saying about just being sometimes i go in the studio and it 's not like i 've start making it i 'm like i 'm not it 's not giving me anything um some days so i 'll i 've i 've found it easier the more i 've engaged in my practice to go okay i 'm not getting anything done here so i 'll leave it for another day and i 'll put my energies elsewhere um but that 's taken a bit of time to establish rather than i guess beating myself up going why can 't i do this this is the time i set to do this so i guess in a sense i 've learned to be softer on myself with the barriers that come up yeah i think it 's important to be kind to yourself set goals but if you don 't always reach them it 's okay life can get in the way yeah yeah it 's nice to be gentle on yourself can i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm very yeah yeah i just remember a period of time where the art making you know as a professional was so isolating actually and that it um the isolation of the art making was was really hard about what was really hard about it um and and i think that 's probably why i moved into slowly moved into the art therapies because yeah i did public art and did a lot of collaborative works with community and and other practitioners and then moved into the art therapy and yeah there 's that time around you know when when i 'm holding a group for people you know that they can spend that time with themselves while in um relationship or connection to other people because you know and then people go home and they find it really difficult to do that because it 's it is sometimes um it it 's just very isolating being in that space and actually what we 're needing is more connection um but you know now in a busy time of my life it 's like oh god give me some solitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of one yeah yeah that 's right so you know isolation you know being creative can be quite isolating um so i guess it 's it 's the balance unless you 're completely absorbed and got that flow like you were talking about before get that rhythm and get the task meeting your needs um at the time and and extending yourself um yeah otherwise it can be quite hard it can be i think in response to that it 's definitely something that i might dive into the work for a few days and feel that sense of rhythm and then come out of it going oh why do i feel so kind of alone yes because i haven 't been like because i have been but i 'm so absorbed but it 's like i i haven 't quite got to acknowledging that it is isolating sometimes and then it can be um it can give me a low mood um yes it 's identifying that which i 'm still learning yeah yeah maybe i think do you think some of that is the when you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all comes out and you just as you say in that state of flow once you 've passed that peak and you come come down the other side it 's sort of the natural the the natural process really just you 've expanded yourself and now you 've just got to rest so sometimes yeah yeah sometimes not all the time i think it 's it varies depending on the project and whether it 's something that 's definitely what it 's small scale large scale it 's kind of like deep sea diving in a way like you 've kind of gone really deep in to this place and they you know and you know emerging and then coming into contact it 's like whoa how do i do that again yeah it 's a bit like you 're disoriented it 's like after you 've seen a movie if anyone remembers that wow you know when you come out of my own you 're a bit you 've lost your in fact apparently that 's a thing you lose your peripheral vision so maybe it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard you 're a bit wobbly socialize again it 's almost social skills and um re-familiarizing with conversations we 've got them with our face aren 't we after lots of months and years of wearing masks we won 't know how to understand each other 's faces yeah yeah so um what about you on that front mat is it is are there times when you yeah creativity doesn 't it doesn 't do it for you it 's not helpful you have to well i mean my experience is quite different i guess from uh what ellie and tanya have spoken about because my art actually brings me into contact with people um you know i i predominantly photograph people rather than landscapes or street scenes um and so it 's actually been a boon to my mental health in terms of social connection what i 've experienced in the last few months though and i don 't think i 'm on my own here is that with um covert and restrictions on movement restrictions on on um social interaction with people that 's been a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my normal kind of work at the moment um and so that 's that 's posed some real difficulties um and i think that 'll be reflected across the community whether people are artists or not and i have had some conversations with people who are actually quite concerned about how they 're going to re-enter community again after having such a period of isolation but definitely in terms of editing you know i can get stuck in an editing wormhole and experience stuff that um ellie and tenure um you know very kind of um accurately kind of portrayed you know that kind of it 's almost coming out of a dark theater going what where have i been what 's happened and i talked to anybody for three days um and that can be quite disorienting um but yeah now most of the time i 'm i 'm working off the energy of other people i 'm a bit of a vampire artistically um and so as long as i 've got that other people 's energy around me i don 't experience a lot of barriers yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group want to comment on that there 's an idea but even if you 're a creative person but sometimes it 's not helpful well you can 't tell i 'll actually say a couple of things anna um i find in my practice the pressure of the expectation of producing a body of work can actually do the flip from reverse and make me want to run um and and not do the work um so that can that can be a problem sometimes if you have an expectation a body of work an exhibition a timeline um and i 'll often procrastinate right up until maybe a few weeks before and then you just explode with all the work that you 've got to do then you get busy in it i i guess and you 're getting that flow because you have to you 're forced into it um so but it can be a roadblock yeah yeah interesting yeah there 's nothing like um the whole science of procrastination is another topic altogether isn 't it like what it what it is that that blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not doing it you 're doing it in your head all the time it 's just it hasn 't it 's yeah you 've got a physical block with yeah it 's interesting i don 't know yeah sometimes it 's almost better without a deadline like without interesting having worked with artists and made my own practice for quite a lot of years now is what what 's your main motivation is that are you making the work just for self-expression or are you making it always with an idea that you want to share it with a with the public can you have an exhibition or you want to make money from whatever it is you know what 's that because there are different categories there aren 't there yeah or are you doing it as something just to dive into and take you away from thinking about other things yeah sorry personally for myself i started off just doing it for myself and i actually now want to try and oh my god i 'm getting low on battery um i don 't know why that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes i want to make it a money business you know i mean teaching has always been on the money side yeah but obviously i haven 't been able to charge much for people to come and learn and people expect to pay less with we 're the only profession really that people expect to pay no more than 10 bucks an hour can i add to that and and just say that that the nature of art in itself throws up a lot of stuff around self-worth and self-value and yeah and it it 's just it 's inherent because you have to put value on your own work and your own time and and when you go to put it out in the world and you know who 's going to like it and what you 're going to get from it that kind of thing and then you know coming to know your own value coming to trust it and rely upon it and um yeah and kind of put that out there and and i mean i i see art you know having done you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know i can kind of really see that there 's this continuum which they 're you know where it 's just process mainly processing for your mental health and for your self-benefit you know where there 's just a process and the end product means not very much it 's a form of communication with yourself to taking it all the way to the other end of the scale where you know there 's skill involved and it 's about the object and and and then it 's for viewing you know so it 's like there 's this whole continuum and and i think kind of coming to know where you are on that continuum at any given time and your intention um and where the value is in that you know like as an artist it 's like there 's a lot of warm-up work and work that you might throw in the bin but actually adds to that end product um you know an artwork can take you years to finish i mean how do you put a value on that you know so it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to think about and weigh up all the time yeah i was just going to say that 's definitely been my experience with the music community obviously i work very closely with with music community particularly around brunswick and none of those guys can play at the moment um in front of an audience but what i am seeing is lots of people going back into their home studios or writing or revisiting old old music and and um renewing it um in the meantime before they can um go back out and perform um and so yeah all is not lost there 's there 's a lot of creativity that 's coming out of this time where people can 't actually um connect with others directly yeah absolutely absolutely i think we we um maybe we need to share those with a bit more too we 've got another we 've got a couple of questions left uh and there 's a little bit of wrap up at the end but the next question i 'd just like to address to elena and you 've covered this a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it is what do you what do you use to be creative like what your main materials if you like and i know you work across disciplines so i find your work very interesting like that well um let me think materials well if that um to imagine a representation of a summary of materials that would be probably the first the first thing would be coming from music from some kind of composition spontaneous one just reflecting on what is at the moment and that musical composition might be reflected further um on on some surface on canvas with with would that be oil or acrylic painting and i might then further look at the painting that 's being produced and reflect onto it further with some poetry um yeah so for poetry i use my telephone or my laptop in terms of the shift from because i was kind of working in soft sculpture both large and small scale for a little while um and i actually had a break from making for a long period of time last year so this year um actually talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i had from my bachelor degree um a few years ago and that 's kind of when i came back to this idea of the illustration which is almost pattern-like work in a way um and yeah i kind of wanted to revisit that um so i began creating other work in response to what i 've found from the past um yeah and then um in terms of the 2d i kind of shifted this here to creating more wool like wall hung pieces um i guess i started doing a tapestry workshop right before all the covered happened and that kind of i participated in that workshop right in the middle of creating a body of work for the hume show which i in a way kind of not so much intentionally i 've subconsciously begun this um like adapted these things i 've learned in the tapestry workshop to creating this body of work um so i had all these intentions of creating these 3d objects um kind of wrapped in soft materials and then i just ended up making all these wall mounted pieces um without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out in a way kind of how shea was saying it just all when just happens yeah where did you do your weaving where was the course um it was at the australian tapestry workshop yeah very beautiful oh it 's close to the city it was just a two-day workshop it was quite good um because i was already working with the similar materials it felt really familiar it just was a very technical workshop which was interesting to kind of reign in coming from a less technical way of making work yeah so it kind of influenced the whole body of work yeah for anyone who doesn 't know that um the tapestry workshop in south melbourne i think it is yeah they they 've created uh enormous uh tapestries sometimes interpretations of paintings by artists and there there 's i think there 's work up at the airport not that anyone 's been there for a while but um some of the embassies they 've just these enormous enormous tapestries that often worked on by several weavers at once and visit it 's really such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think a couple of times a year obviously not at the moment i think they 're actually struggling quite a lot right now they 're probably yeah they probably are but yeah it 's really amazing to look at the way they work because they 'll have three or four weavers working on this five or six meter wide work and it 's just like what they 're doing is so small and it takes maybe six months to a year to create one piece that 's incredible it 's just brilliant it was very very inspiring yeah it 's a very unique form of art isn 't it that harks back to history and we think about all those old walls of castles covered with tapestries to try and keep them warm i think historical things yeah interesting so i 've got we 've got um the the last question uh and it 's probably a some uh summing up question really but it 's it 's an open question of how does creativity aid your mental wellbeing in particular as opposed to the general idea of oh it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it help you specifically if you you know has there been a particular time when it 's been been really useful yeah well i think you know creativity makes me um [Music] it does so much really for me um where i just feel like now my whole life is really you know that 's that 's the core of my life and you know bringing things into being um and i i it can hold me when i 'm got strong emotions like if it provides a space for me to be able to be with myself in a caring compassionate way or it can hold volatile emotions but then it also can be you know quite a spiritual experience where i feel like i 'm connecting with something greater than myself or i feel like i 'm hearing myself or i 'm seeing myself so it creates this whole spectrum of validation um of my existence and when it gets birthed into this object or you know a beautiful meal or you know a collaborative outcome um it 's it 's kind of like oh yeah it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important aspect and i feel like through the covert and noticing how important it 's been for people you know through the groups and it 's it 's like it 's kind of got this um it 's becoming more apparent how important it actually is in people 's lives um and it 's not just kind of this hidden thing that only artistic people do but actually it 's a it 's an important aspect of recovery and healing um on all levels whether it 's you know physical or mental so um yeah i kind of uh maybe creativity is my god i like that yeah yeah so maybe that 's yeah i 'll just put that down like that that 's that 's a really solid underlying conclusion that 's great definitely our senses can be a very strong trigger for things so we know for example sense of smell can trigger memories we can be brought to tears by a piece of art whether it be a movie music um a still image so there is a very strong relationship there but there 's also with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um are fed back to the brain you know so if we 're talking about um psychotic type illnesses like schizophrenia for example all the messages from the senses gets get scrambled uh on the way to the brain is the simplest way i can put it um and so uh that can pose difficulties too around people interpreting the sensations that they have i guess the most from my perspective the most beneficial thing though is around just being able to be in the moment and and being able to just divert our attention to what our senses are telling us so you know coming back to things like you know mindfully drinking a glass of water or mindfully sitting in front of a piece of art and just taking it in and being present i 'd just like to say thank you to everyone for for the speakers for participating and the people that have come and shared their experiences i think these are the kind of conversations that i 'm very interested in going forward because as we 've touched on mental health i think in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not talked out enough um i think i i that 's just from my experience in i guess my own family friends connections but i find it still that topic that people don 't know how to broach with others um and i 've found that art is a good way to begin that conversation you,"(-37.6819035, 144.9179152)"

and this pandemic hopefully this will be over soon the wondrous warrior tribe consists of three families the nevin satirics and the londons and i 'm part of the nevin family the three families all descend from one woman called annie borat which makes us one big family annie borat is the younger sister william barrett a pioneer for aboriginal people in the 19th century fighting for equality and land rights i 'm here today to open you all to the land of my ancestors we call the land within our tribal boundaries our country the cooler nation coolant meaning man is made up of five groups they are the original burnarong and to give you an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover we extend north to the great dividing range east of mount balboa south to the malady creek and west of the werribee river many thousands of years ago if an aboriginal person from another tribe wanted to cross our boundary they would have to sit at the boundary and wait for the norigida which is the head man to come past to give them permission to cross traditional aboriginal culture was highly territorial and visitors risked a violent reprisal for crossing a tribal clown boundary without this permission and this is how welcome to country originated in our culture traditionally being welcomed onto country you meant you respected bundles law banjo the witch tale eagle is our creator and while the crow is our protector and as long as you looked after our country you had access to our waterways and our land resources and when you enter our country we ask that you respect our resources our fauna flora and water as they are very special to us and when you leave we ask that you leave it the way you found it the wondrous connection to land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the europeans the laundry room belonged to the land they did not live in a permanent settlement but rather camped for periods with defined clown boundaries where fruit was plentiful and moved on when the land needed to be rejuvenated the land provided the laundry warrior or what they needed their food their water medicine shelter and they treated it with respect for being such a provider nade off week is a very special week for aboriginal and torres strait people it 's a week of celebration celebrating our culture people community history and achievements this year 's theme is always wise and always will be always wise and always will be recognized as the third nations people have occupied and cared for this continent for over 65 000 years we are spiritually and culturally connected to the country this country was crisscrossed by generations of brilliant nations aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples were australia 's first explorers first navigators first engineers first farmers first botanist first scientists and first diplomats first astronomers and first artists always always was and always will be acknowledges that australians also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all were managing the land the biggest estate on earth

story begins at the dawn of time nato 2020 invites you all australians to embrace the true history of this country a history which dates back thousands of generations it 's about seeing hearing and learning first nations 65 years of history of this country which is australian history we want all australians to celebrate that we have the oldest continuing cultures on this planet and to recognize

listen to our voice understand our history and learn the truth about what happened to our indigenous ancestors now adopted started as a protest in neoligance and can be traced to the emergence of aboriginal groups in the 1920s which sought to increase awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboriginal and torres strait islander australians now it is a week-long celebration of our history our culture our
