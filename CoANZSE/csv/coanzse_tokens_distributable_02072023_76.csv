Ross,NugGDj6O5XY,20210408,638.0,"Townsville QLD 4810, Australia",1540,i 'm sylvia ditchburn i 'm a visual artist when i met my husband 55 years ago we decided we wanted to move around a bit so we came up north so we 've stayed in townsville for for a number of years i went on to do a graduate diploma museum curatorship and then i did a masters and then a phd well i 've always been in love with the landscape i just love the natural environment and and i 've done a lot of plein air painting out in central australia i 've done safaris out there and i 've [Music] loved the tropics i 've done a lot of tropical work we belong to the bird observers club and they used to have a breakfast buddhist breakfast and i 'd never heard of lome island before and i didn 't know where it was so they had the breakfast there and after we 'd finished we all went wandering around having a look for birds and i was just amazed at the beautiful melaleuca paperbacks and all the lilies and the birds and so i um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back several we went back several times i did some plein air painting there and sketching and so forth i happened to come across an exhibition of nolan sydney newlands called riverbend and it was done in the round a panorama as artists do i was just thinking about how i would what i would do for my next exhibition and you know i thought oh but that may work um just using lome island as as that because i wanted that immersion i was really impressed with how nolan 's work was going for the way he um put together his river bend because i didn 't want just a series of individual paintings i wanted it to be more than that well the way i work with that with my paintings is that um i always like to go to the environment to collect my uh images and but because this exhibition was large works uh it 's too difficult for me to do them in the field so what i was doing was we went out and i walked along the path and did a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come when i came back i just had to sort them out in how they would look together i didn 't really want it to flow on too much but you know i think that how they 've worked is i wanted to have an upward um look and i want to have a downward look and and i wanted to have different perspectives so that people found it interesting and also the birds i 've managed to put in the jacana bird and the cormorant cockatoos and so forth there there 's so many many birds and that are around there so it 's lovely when i decided to do it in the round or the panorama we came into the gallery and measured it up then ken made the canvases for me then i had to prepare them all and after that i had to do the drawings i did the drawing in pencil on on the canvas well it 's taken me it 's taken me a long time to develop this show because i put in my proposal about 2014. and uh with this sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sunday painter it 's a it 's an exhibition that you 've got once you start it you really have to keep going otherwise you lose the flow of it you 've got you know the the colours will change because you 've left it too long to mix up the what you wanted and when when i 've actually started the paintings it 's been about six months i 'll put the last brushstroke on on sunday i had to keep i had to be very diligent and keep painting every day not all day but every day and until it was done well i 'd never really been a fan of palette knife but i discovered the um the spatulas which palette knives are only small knives you know they 're and flexible they can be a bit longer but they 're usually very flexible and thin but i went to the you can 't get them at the art shop you 've got to go to the the cooking shop and they 've got quite a lot of them to use for icing cakes so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flexibility of the knife to use on it you can 't just have a little spot it 's got to be a real lump of paint and you gather up your paint and then you put it on the trunk and you 'll you just get this beautiful textured effect like the paper box that would emulate the paper box which were a beautiful feeling my studio at home is well we bought the house because of the studio it was it was a family room it was uh ideal for me and it was quite quite large of course it 's never never large enough for a painter once you start going in there putting all your work in there what i would do without oh well there 's lots of things like in music and easel brushes and um oh and a wick palette a wet palette is i 've managed to get oh you can make your own i guess but it 's a it 's quite a large one and the base of it is a sort of a spongy fabric you wet and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrylic paint and especially in this climate it tends to dry out rapidly than you want and so and then you can put a lid on it at the end of the day so you 've still got your paint there for the next day the best advice i was given was don 't give up keep going even when you feel like no one loves you and it is true you you 'll have doubts about yourself fairly early in your career but if it 's something you love you 've really got to stay with it but you 've got to try different things and try different techniques and have a look at a lot of art and go to some artists workshops and so forth it 's always you know that they 're really good information to help you along the way you can discard what you don 't like the challenges i face when i 'm presenting my artwork is is finding the the right gallery for my work but you have to have the right proposal you know to be accepted and you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do your research have it backed up by some drawings and information that you 're going to put forward and some previous work because the gallery is not going to take you very seriously if you haven 't done that sort of thing also selling work because it costs a lot of money to to be an artist it 's very expensive so that 's another challenge to get over i 've been fortunate people have liked my work so i 've had a lot of support over the years living in north queensland it 's um it has its benefits and its uh disadvantages uh you 're in a smaller pool of artists so whereas if you 're in a city you 'd have a uh there are more opportunities because it 's larger there 's more things happening more galleries and but there 's a bigger pool of artists there so there 's six of one and half a dozen the other like you can always send your work down to galleries there that 's regarding covert it i think it 's been disastrous for the arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery in ogden street for 10 years and then we moved over to flinders street for that opportunity came about it was a really good position not many galleries that are in the main street but there was no one in the cbd and no one 's definitely those people when spending money on art so yeah we closed it down and of course i have got a website but it 's nowhere near as good well yet as the uh shop front oh yes i 'd really like to thank the first tucker gallery for hosting my show and had a lovely catalogue and an essay by louise martin chu she wrote wrote a lovely essay also my husband for the video he made which enlarges on the exhibition and and everybody who supported my work thank you you,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

4810, Australia",1260,[Music] so my full name is lauren j carter i 'm a cairns based printmaker i 've lived in far north queensland for about four five years now i was originally on magnetic island and then moved to townsville and currently living in cairns printmaking i got into visual arts quite early my family always encouraged me uh you know to go to art camp after school classes they took me to you know all the major exhibitions that were on not because i think they wanted me to grow up and be a famous artist but i think they just loved not that i am but they could just say that i really loved making art and being creative so study wise i when i left school i did a design diploma in sydney i studied jewelry and object design so i 've got a bit of a design background and then later on when i moved from sydney to melbourne i studied printmaking so i did a fine arts degree at rmit in melbourne and after that i had a scholarship at the australian print workshop where i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i chose yonder as the name mostly because i was continuing my work with landscapes so i 've done a lot of prints that didn 't start out as landscapes but ended up as landscapes i don 't usually plan the end of a print at the start i sort of print a whole bunch of material and then look at it at the end and see what goes together so once i 'd constructed these landscapes i guess yonder just fed into my ideas on um perceiving things that you can 't necessarily see or your ideas or your curiosity on places that are far away or yeah your how your expectations meet reality or not so yonder seem to be fitting because it 's it 's somewhere you can 't reach basically you can only imagine uh in this exhibition my favorite piece or probably um group of pieces would be the ones behind me they 're they 're probably more subtle than the other works the colors are a bit more muted but that 's the palette that i prefer i am sometimes i worry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but personally i like the subtle ones the way that i work i start by taking photographs so usually just on my iphones mostly natural textures rocks tree bark concrete just things that i look at and think it would be interesting to try and replicate that pattern or that texture in print making so then i print my photos out i usually trace some of the lines and then i transfer the lines to a lino block it 's quite a long process and then yeah i usually combine a few different techniques so i use etched lino and carved lino and i just print a really large amount of material in different colors and then i see how it all fits together at the end putting it all together i use a lot of stencils and templates so i sort of create because my work 's abstract i i do just start with shapes and then i overlay those transparencies and see what looks good together or what might flow on to the next the next object so yeah a lot of overlay and transparency and cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long long process so at the moment i have a home studio which i 've just set up after my move to cairns so i 've got an etching press and a lot of space to do a lot of printing down there prior to that prior to my studio in cairns i had a studio at murky waters which is in townsville that place that 's still operating is an artists run initiative so i started that with a few other local artists which was really exciting so that it 's along the river it was a really great place to to make artwork and have shows i have a newish piece of equipment which is a really large spindle roller it 's basically a large imagine like a steamroller with handles but a mini one and then you roll ink onto it and then that ink is transferred from the roller to the block or the lino that you 're printing from so without the roller you can 't do any work basically so that 's my favorite piece of equipment the best piece of artistic advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at rmit i know i used to stress a lot about not knowing what kind of work i was going to make or not knowing what i wanted to do and i had a lecturer that explained to me that you know your creative response is unique to you so whatever you are making it will have your signature on it because it 's come from you basically and i 've definitely found that to be true um looking at older work that i 've done even if it 's a different style or different medium i can sort of see that it 's got my you know my stamp on it somehow so that 's what i would say so my advice for emerging artists would mostly be just to attend workshops attend conferences go and work in a studio with other practicing artists printmaking is very technical so any tips or any hints you can get of people that have gone before you and figured out they 've problem solved something that you could spend hours or weeks trying to figure out i know i 've done that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try that try that material and then it saved a lot of time so yeah just talk to other artists they 're very helpful challenges when presenting my artwork to the public it 's probably trying to get them to understand the medium the installation that i 've done beyond yonder it 's the large sprawling landscape at the front of the exhibition um basically that 's a new thing for me i haven 't done a large installation that big but it was um it 's made up of all of my different print material it 's different shapes different cutouts something that i had to make as i went along i didn 't really know how it was all going to fit together or how it was going to look it 's quite long it 's about five meters long but it was a it was a really good challenge and yeah i 'm happy with the results uh exhibiting at the purse tucker regional gallery has been a really great experience for me i 've only exhibited here in group shows previously there 's a great team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to you know put together a to fill a space this big so i would encourage anyone who 's scared of having a solo show to just to just go ahead and do it because everyone 's very helpful and it 's it 's worthwhile it 's worth the effort and the anxiety so yeah thank you you,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

Butler,A7WjTr-yFjA,20210210,700.399,"Townsville QLD 4810, Australia",1643,we have a story about how the southern cross come to be there so it comes from kunangalbar which is dunk island it 's part of our land and the sand spit that faces west it 's a taboo place we 're not allowed to go fishing there and way back a long time ago there was this two boys who were walking down to the sand spit dragging their canoe and the old man spotted him and he came over and he said so where you going and they said oh we 're going down here go fishing out off the sand spit and he said no you 're not allowed to go over there that 's taboo place you 're not allowed to fish there it 's one of our safe places it 's like a green zone so when we looked at it that 's how we treat those places so there 's fish and safety so the two boys said no no no we don 't believe the story we 're going to go fishing there and he said well if you go over there you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back so it was about this time in the evening after they put their canoes in and they went out and they dropped the stone anchor over and they 're watching weather was good sun was going down the milky way started to appear on the right hand side so then all of a sudden one of the boys got a bite on the line and he could feel the nibble tug tug and then slowly got tighter the line got tighter so he sunk the pearl hook into that fish and that fish took off in that direction there straight over towards where the milky way comes down to meets the earth and it started to drag him and dragged the canoe all the way down from kunangalbar all the way down to manamadanami which is uh hinchenbrook island and when it dragged that canoe the weather started to get dark and the old man lost sight of him and then all of a sudden in the sky he could see the southern cross appearing the two pointer stars that point east are the two boys in the canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down there and that fish is what we call dewey dewey which is a shovel nose shark you may find that story inside the great barrier reef marine park authorities um under marine rays and sharks i think it is there so that story tells us how that constellation come to be there so then when we look at the sky we can navigate of an evening which way is east and when i go in the bush and we camp with the kids we always like to face our tent the right way you ever watch your dog when he goes out in the yard and he wants to lie down he doesn 't just flop over he goes round and round and round and he 's looking for the right space what he 's doing is orientating himself with the earth we do that when we set up our tents and stuff and when we want to camp and that 's what it 's all about learning to orientate and know where that sun comes up which is over there and where it goes down over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent so the breeze will come through our tent if it 's winter time we turn sideways but we still sleep in the direction that we want to sleep in it 's like being a dog i suppose and knowing exactly where things are so the next story i 'll tell you is about the seven sisters and when they 're in the sky they 're just about there so how i know all this stuff is because i spend a lot of time out in the bush and it 's really good to orientate yourself with the bush you know so when i look around and i look at where the milky way is where dewey dewey is where the two pointers are the two naughty boys in the canoe then i 'll follow it across the sky and i know where my gallon gun is mcgullen gun is about the seven sisters this story is part of a story that goes all the way to the center of australia we have what we call song lines and story lines that um captivate these stories and allow us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no machinery to get there we we interact and when we go on walkabout the walkabouts are real some of our people went miles and miles and miles away and they had to travel there and they had to have a message stick message stick is about as long as my finger i suppose i 'm not giving you the finger here the message stick is about that long and on there there 's little holes drilled in it and um little cuts and grooves and they have meaning and that 's the only way we communicate by doing stuff on on bits of wood so anyway the story about the seven sisters is about a law that wasn 't meant to be broken the seven sisters they were all steps and stairs from growing up right down to little people anyway this old man came in amongst the girls and they he said to him i 'm gonna marry your baby sister and way back a long time ago this is a men 's world this was a male world and no woman was allowed to say no but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're an evil old man and with that they run away and he said well i 'm gonna catch up with you and we 're gonna punish you because that 's the law you broke a law here so they took off and they run this way and they run towards where the milky way hits the earth and they just kept going and going and then it got dark they run up on a hill like kutaringa here organavaro the dingo run up on it and jumped on the milky way and run right across here and that 's why they 're etched in the sky just about there now and the old man followed him but he was too slow he chased him jumped up on top got disorientated in amongst all the stars and that 's when he got lost and he walked out here and he went out here to where the evening star is and that 's why today when we look up there we see that star we call that star you bulgar which is named after that old man now that evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening one of the good things about that star is when somebody in our family dies all of our children cry for them it might be the mum or it might have been the dad that passed away if they want to see that grandfather or mother or grandmother then we tell them the last the first star that comes up in the evening if you sit down in your backyard and look up that 's your mother or your grandmother whoever it is passed away and they 're missing we tell them to look up there and see that star and remember their family that family member especially that family member is to make sure that the little kids understand that nothing is lost forever one day we go to find them and when we pass away we will see them again so our dream time our dreaming place here for us where salt water people from henchmen brook island our dreaming places out there on the great barrier reef so when we pass away that 's where our spirit goes that 's the place we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country where we used to live so one time ago the ocean shores were not just here they were way out there lapping against the the uh what do they call it the big drop off at the barrier reef and that 's the place where we used to live it used to be rain forest all the river systems run out malmel is birdicon galbadire is ross river uh warren is herbert river and they all run out across that plains here and there 's 42 miles to get to that great barrier reef and then they dropped off the big continental shelf as that word so it dropped off there and there was water waterfalls everywhere and then one day the ocean started to rise as it is happening right now way back then it wasn 't influenced by people but i think the rising of the waters right now is influenced by us and when when this started to happen they started to prepare to come back this way so we 're talking about 20 000 years ago when the ice cap melted and then we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

bertha totally deaf they lived on dunk island alone now this began in townsville this wonderful wonderful love story but he was supposed to pass away within a year but he didn 't he lived for another 23 years on bremmo bay on dunk island the idyllic life the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you go to magnetic island while you 're here over the next couple of weeks you heard the little introduction i 'm a broadcaster i 'm privileged to be on the radio every morning as i have been for near 40 mango seasons and i loved learning about this city so i sat in the library about well 37 mango seasons ago and learnt things you see our city our north queensland they spent a lot of time naming our beautiful parts of the world let 's have a look at the island now this a lot of thought went into the name of magnetic island or young bernan no this is serious stuff the beautiful western area of the island that point they spent a lot of time they named it west point there 's a little island just off west point just in the bay there so the early pioneers they named it bay rock there 's a little reef in between magnetic island and the bigger island australia a lot of thought went into this they called it middle reef this is these are story these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cape cleveland there 's two beautiful beaches one 's a rather long beach it 's called long beach the one right next to it who is not as long that 's called short beach you know there 's a bay over there there 's five beaches in it guess what they called it five beach bay and all the waterfalls are running at huntingfield there 's some rocks at the end of cape cleveland they dry to 20 foot 20-foot rock and the other one drives to four foot so that 's called four-foot rock see you 're learning you 'll be able to teach the kids this there 's a little bay on the other side of cape cleveland in the mid 1800s the shipwrecked sailors of the peruvian came to shore on this beach one of them james morrill after all the others had passed away there were 34 years at sea after going ashore at miniver shoals this is the torment the tragedy but indeed the strength of our pioneers now i believe this man james moral there should be a statue here because we talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ james morrill he lived 17 years here here with the local first australians 17 years 17 years he was very frightened on one occasion he was taken to the elders for foreign and he thought he was going to be the main course but when he got there he realized that the fire wasn 't quite big enough to cook him but he was panic-stricken well you imagine him he 's scottish fella and it was in the area of here and it was pretty wild he hadn 't seen anyone else other than his new family everyone else had passed away that he was on the on the ship with on the peruvian everyone else had passed away so he went to this corroboree and he thought it was his end of days but the local elders of this area could see that he was frightened that he thought that he was going to be cooked so what they did and i always reckon this is this most wonderful story and it says so much for this amazing area what they did all the elders they put their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this big scottish man and all the elders went up to him and put their warm hands upon him to make him feel safe to make him feel a part of the family and that i reckon is a story that should be that should be told i might have some photos mike phil 's probably listening look as i mentioned uh i am a broadcaster and they said to me please tell a little bit of your story the picture that 's about to come up phil is when i was 17 so it was taken 20 years ago don 't you reckon the noses are the same have a look at the noses the man is john eden now this is

4810, Australia",2431,good evening all as part of the northern stories event this evening we will reflect on and celebrate an event that put townsville on the map literally and i 've been invited to talk about this floating hotel to share this story with you now a good story as you probably know should have a beginning a middle and an end the story of townsville 's fabulous floating hotel has two beginnings a middle and no end yet it also has an exciting cast of characters at the plot with plenty of twists and turns once you 've heard that i think you 'll agree it 's a very good story please join me on reflecting what happened let 's start on the two beginnings the first beginning was in year 1952 when someone called doc tarka the son of italian immigrants and a young man with big ideas arrived in townsville next one please and there you see him as an abbey diver doug was eager to share his passion for the great barrier reef with those who could not visit it in person after obtaining coral harvesting rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the same spot where the telstra building now is in south townsville next one please how many of you remember that coral gardens and fluorescent displays of corals delighted visitors for many many years you could even purchase novelty items made from coral the next one please now in 1983 dark went a step further launching reeflink to ferry daytrippers to townswater john brewer reef by means of a high-speed catamaran for the reef link one to snorkel and dive on the reef itself now that any some of you may have done that trip in your lifetime 1983 to 1988 but that still was not enough for doug he wanted to go a step further for some time the oil industry had been developing offshore floating accommodation for their oral rick workers okay why not create a one-of-a-kind floating luxury hotel so the people could stay overnight on the reef and experience the reef at leisure next month please for a while doctor toyed with the concept of wearing old ocean liners at john brewer reef it was abandoned it was not very practical too expensive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only a couple of years later that the idea of a floating hotel became a reality now another beginning in 1982 when he killed king cole the 16th gustaf of sweden that swedish royalty on an official state visit to america or to australia visited the henderson shipyard near fremantle next one here is the ship just building a floating dormitory for oral wreck workers on the northwest shelf in the western australia now the king was very interested because a swedish company called con safe engineering was a contractor for the project corn safe had already built simmer accommodations for the oil and gas industry in the north sea and they 're called flotels floating hotels and this is one of them built at corn sales facility in singapore in 1983 next one doesn 't look very much like a floating hotel but watch what happens later so king kong gustaf put a simple but direct question to the australian project manager named john parker good concept please get more contracts to build flotels for australia it was almost like a royal command don 't you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get to the middle as it happened john parker worked with the construction company john holland on a project in canberra he met one of one of the company 's employees was a gentle command called sam taco who was doctor 's brother and he spoke about his brother 's idea to build a floating hotel on john barrow reef it will be a big step up from an old dormitory 1984 john parker met with jack tarq and townsend and they went out on reeflink to if they want to inspect the proposed site next one and here you see where is john brewer reef it 's about 70 kilometers north of townsville east of great palm island and most of you probably know that is one of the sites for the museum of underwater art as well so the story carries on and certain well 1986 after many discussions with banks investors lawyers designers and engineers they visited the reef again with a representative from consafe and two engineers from the shipyard in singapore that was going to build the hotel the next one and here you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinny and duck talk is saying the hotel will be built there quite a interesting slide by the way construction took place in singapore at bethlehem shipyard with a con safe design team based there as well next one the shipyard would still exist had been established in 1970 as a subsidiary company of bethlehem steel of pennsylvania united states america specialized in building oil rigs so obviously that would be the perfect company to build a floating hotel in as a design evolved various models of the proposed hotel were created this is the one in our maritime museum next one which you can see for yourself which was restored by one of our volunteers this is one of the original models if it was donated to us in the 1990s is now part of our duck talk exhibition which i hope you will see one day the reported costs of building the hotel was anything between 40 and 55 million dollars was a lot of money for those days australian dollars that is and here 's the nearly completed hotel at bethlehem shipyard in singapore the next one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finished hotel five thousand kilometers from singapore to john maria reef was our mission next one so it was positioned on top of a huge semi-submersible heavy lift ship the mighty servant iii transported to the reef um and in order to withstand tropical cyclones the hotel was more to no less than seven huge anchors inside the lagoon after being very carefully maneuvered inside the laguna bronze jumbo reef the hotel itself was called the floater or the floating hotel but his real name was four season reef resort a very very long name and in march 1988 the hotel opened its doors with a lot of publicity and fanfare next one please and here you can see all the press reports of those days um now how do you how did you get there most guests arrived via another high-speed catamaran called reeflink 2 which could carry up to 400 passengers at the top speed of 32 knots was a real big guy next one or there could come by helicopter there was a helipad next to the hotel the seven-story hot structure had 176 rooms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i do know i 've met people who actually stayed at a hotel or worked there who actually were there on opening night and they said it was a fantastic experience what will you now see are some grainy images taken from a video produced by duck targets and peter tucker in 1988 this video is on show at the maritime museum now here 's the lobby erie that would have greeted you on arrival next one after checking in you could freshen up in your deluxe room next one for fine dining head to one of the hotels to restaurants next one they served everything from light snakes to sanchez buffets and featured the culinary skills of a master chef from europe and if you wanted a dancer night away there was a hotel disco called the boiler room next one here you are inside the pontoon other activities included a flirting fence and tennis court and i think most of the balls ended up floating in the pacific anyway uh tennis court on the ocean but was a funny idea a gym and a sauna and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of outdoor activities to wear so swimming snorkeling diving feeding the fish next one you can see a lot of people having fun in the sun swimming in the lagoon no worries if you forgot to bring sunscreen or your swim fins to italian at the dive shop and a gift shop to meet all your niece needs and there was another vessel called the yellow submarine that was officially was called the manta was named after the beatles song we all live in a yellow submarine so here you have the other submarine the next one which has was designed and built by doctor in town south townsville where you could sit in comfort below the water line and looked at fish and fish and more fish and the reef you spit in that glass bottom boat staffed who worked at the hotel they had fun fault memories of working there staff parties flying pizzas and all the way from townsville with a helicopter that 's great almost like a domino 's pizza service although it was doug targa 's brainchild he was not involved in the development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit far away and um many people got stranded you know if they want to go back to the airport if there was rough weather the catamaran didn 't go the helicopter didn 't go there was bad weather insufficient marketing it was an expensive place to go an airline strike higher operating costs than others in 1989 only a year after opening the three of the floating until closed down was sold to a company in vietnam next one and there it is it left john brewer reef on top of another ship as it was moored in the saigon river vietnam had rebounded after the disastrous vietnam war and they were keen to get tourists then so they were looking for a ready-made hotel which what the floating hotel on john brewer it was ideal it could just put brought there more than the saigon river and was open so the locals called it the floater and it was a popular popular light spot for almost a decade however in 1998 the hotel had run again once again run into financial difficulties now here comes the interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ korea and relocated with the third time another five thousand kilometers or so to the mount kunggang resort in north korea it was renamed hotel heimkung and kind of the next one and here you it was when kim jong-il was in charge he wanted to boost tourism and he allowed the south korean company to construct resort and hotel facilities and there you can see the floating hotel looks very different than john brewery of course at um 2008 everything closed down because a north korean security guard shot the tourists so end of tourism can i have the next one please and everybody knows that guy that 's kim jong and that 's our own floating hotel right behind him in october 2019 kim jong-un visited the resort which was rather run down and criticized for being shabby and backward in architecture he announced that all the facilities including the floating hotel would be demolished and redeveloped so that seemed like the end of the floating hotel but in january 2020 the hotel got a reprieve when they postponed the demolition because of the coronavirus and pandemic next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it directly on google earth it 's still sitting there quite fuzzy but that is the floating hotel in north korea as it is now well whatever the essential fate the fabulous floating hotel has a legacy of which to be proud and a lot of other floating hotels followed around the world kind of the next one please they look very much more posh very much more advanced but of course most of those floating hotels are called cruise ships same concept or anything it is it just moves around from spot to spot so our floating hotel has an important another important legacy it had to meet very strict environmental standards because it was bang in the middle of the great barrier reef after the hotel was in place divers successfully transported more than 300 pieces of coral next one please and here you can see all sewage and liquid rice was treated sterilized water was pumped outside the reef trash was incinerated so townsville 's fabulous floating hotel set an example for ecotourism that was ahead of its time the next one so that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped operating in 1989 and was replaced by a ferry service duck talker passed away in 1993 his ashes were scattered at john brewer reef very fitting and a memorial to him sculpted in the shape of a coral bombing and sits next to the museum in neville george maritime park and the next one that is the ducktaco memorial at the tip of the marathon park in south townsville here we are do you think that 's a good story it 's um it 's a story at the beginning two beginnings a middle and not an end yet next one and here are some people who made this all possible this presentation was not my work it was put together by two of my volunteers and there 's heaps of people and they still come forward with information and more information these are just some of them now on display is the story of the floating hotel in the museum and other many many other things doug did you can also learn more at our website okay the next one please the last one so thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you for celebrating the things and the events in the past and the present which made and make townsville a really great place to be have a good evening

broadcast i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of australia townsville north queensland and it is too because it 's us and there 's many people that have made this part of the world magnificent pioneers because in any direction 30 minutes we 're in wilderness any direction 30 minutes wilderness on top of kootharinga there 's a post called jenkinson 's post one of our great pioneers graeme jenkinson and that light you see on castle hill he and a rather crazy broadcaster in 1984 got hold of a little spotlight a wartime spotlight and shotted on that hill to show the council that we could do it an old world war ii spotlight perched up there bringing in the bats in fact that 's why we had to stop because it upset a few of the bats bats are blind but we put it back up and what you see today thanks to the townsville city council you 'll see the lights on our kuthuringa think of earth and the sea i 've just told you about the earth this magnificent coutharinga but what about the sea 30 minutes in that direction wilderness the great coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 110 years ago coming to this city 122 souls on board a ship that doesn 't exist anymore a steamship and this is a great northern story it is the story of the ss young gala 110 years ago on the 23rd of february 23rd of march 1911 122 souls are 121 on the manifest and then they discovered there was an eight month old baby elsa marie murray coming to this city it 's our own titanic and they were lost no survivors it 's a wonderful little passage from ecclesiastics those that have no memorial and perished as if they had never been it was lost for 40 years but that 's how much of a city on the edge of civilization we were this was an open bridge steamship if you get a chance go to the maritime museum read the story of the ss yon gala as a broadcaster from melbourne i came up 37 mango seasons and i fell in love with this story the story of william knight all his crew and people who just coming here to townsville lost gone over 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ben crop finally found the resting place of cape bowling green of the ss yon gala along with doug tarka who ran reeflink i had the great privilege of learning to dive and learning about the magnificent reef but learning about the ss yongala has anyone ever dived the ongala here has anyone ever actually does anyone care does anyone care you know you you talk about this place we wouldn 't be here without the pioneers yes we 've got the great gardens here but you know these gardens were put together by percival pacific andrews name pacific because his dad had a few drinks couldn 't think of any other word and named him pacific and that was in england there 's a wonderful ovary named after him all those stories as a broadcaster in this great city i 've learned because yes we 've got our ipads our phones but you know without the past because we 'll be the past one day we want to be remembered we want to learn so you 'll learn about the ss yong gao all those years ago along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colin hodson took me for my first dive on the on gala have you ever been underwater scary but when you dive on something that was a tomb now this is local this is local history a tomb of 122 people you think of elsa marie murray and when we made it into captain william knight 's amazing little area because 37 mango seasons ago there was still the captain 's cabin and we found a bottle of scotch that had been there from the 23rd of march 1911 110 years ago we put it back just by the way also found a marble table i wish i wish that we had a museum for the ss jongala and so many other great historical parts of this city so that these little ones when they grow up when they grow up they can see and learn about the old steam ships the great old steamships that came to this city in fact matthew rooney was on board across rooney 's bridge he was a timber seller in the city so many of the old buildings here were built thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you learn about ancient you become extremely proud look that hill supposedly is hollow supposedly has areas where there 's military equipment now that 's probably taken a little bit far but there is a tunnel isn 't there berkey all the way from the queen 's hotel all the way through to garbett just in case we needed it during the war years because the americans wanted to knock down castle hill and make it a causeway all the way through to magnetical isle and when you get to the island you know that it 's called magnetic a lot because captain cook lost his way sort of with a compass he pulled a magnetical oil instead of magnetic island which his real name is younger nun it didn 't have a festival these wonderful people put together festivals in our city as a breakfast announcer at this great city i decided to put together a festival called the rediscovery of magnetic island and dress up as captain cook every year and arrive on the beach now when i first did it on the beach at horseshoe bay that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put your hands up the mozzies need something to eat horseshoe i was supposed to arrive i spent ten dollars on an old captain cook outfit but this is what this city is all about when we have an opportunity to celebrate we celebrate one thing and that is lifestyle yes we have a few of them upsetting things that happen in every city in the world but we have lifestyle and we have each other and when i arrived that i expected 200 people on the beach at horseshoe bay to welcome a silly old broadcaster dressed as a 200 year old i felt 200 200 year old captain there are 5 000 people on the beach that day from all over the world just celebrating being silly and you know there 's nothing wrong with being silly and in the northern tropics of australia we can do that and when when captain cook one day accidentally uh was woken up by the police actually capricorn being me oh the copper said to me pricey that moat that you 're driving out there what color is it i said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've stolen someone 's our island had 40 mini marks but only six keys i don 't accidentally take the wrong one home that ran for 10 years there are going to be many more festivals

AUS,QLD,Townsville City Council,Townsville City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaTIMjVP_MxBFaq1B4AYk9A,Northern Stories Sessions – Tom Phirie & Chris Mushaya,uhH_1tqG6ME,20210203,1599.84,"Townsville QLD 4810, Australia",2914,uh good evening everyone my name is tom as you have heard from the introduction i 'm from originally from zimbabwe i came to australia in 2005 with my family it 's been a long journey coming from zimbabwe to australia and it hasn 't been easy but we 've managed to come through uh up to this stage so when we came in uh in 2005 there were actually about four or five african families then at that time so as you can imagine it was not that simple to um you know get in and do what we needed to do so i just wanted to make a a statement that i know when most people think of uh immigrants they will be thinking of refugees coming from all torn countries and all that things which is true but then we have the other side as well where we have professional immigrants who have come in here because they 've been offered opportunities to come and work with us in australia so both of us are those you know professional immigrants who were brought in here so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know from where we grow up and then the one we came into which was quite different from uh you know what we usually had back home but suffice to say australians are very generous people they 're very welcoming and so we were simulated into the community very well most people helped us to go through the processes because we never knew where to find what so after having stayed here for 15 years or 16 years this year i 've seen the african community grow larger and larger which is a good thing the only issue probably which we found was that as we simulated into the australian culture we didn 't really want to lose our african heritage as well so we wanted to keep the kids you know to know that we still have those african cultures and beautiful customs and stuff so this is how we then came together as a group and we formed a african group called spirit of africa some of you might not might know us some might not but the group in general has been responsible for organizing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival annually last year was supposed to be our 10th year running the show but unfortunately due to the covert thing we 're unable to do that so at the moment it 's on standstill the reason why that group was formed uh was so that we could also teach uh the townsville community at large about africa because the first question people ask you is uh africa is a country no africa is not a country it 's actually a continent made up of 54 different countries with different cultures different traditions so yes some people have now come to realize that oh okay we didn 't know that you know and then the other interesting part is they always ask you do you live with animals wild animals like elephants lions and the queen the answer is no we don 't actually because we rarely see those things as well if we have to see them we have to go out into the bushes just like all tourists when they come and you know visit africa so those are some of the learning curves so as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now actually recognized national national wine so we are hoping maybe next year we 'll have another um start on the african festival so i 'll pass it on to my colleague here to say a few words thank you very much tom for those wonderful words um i think it 's the tradition it 's probably been done already we would like to acknowledge the owners of the length the guru kuba people and so as tom indicated we i also came to this country in 2005 um i i it was a bit of an interesting journey actually the way i i came to this country to be in townsville i um i had a friend who got a job at the the gold coast and he uh came to me and said you know what uh chris i 'm going to australia i said oh okay you 're going to australia and he said you know i will i could help you immigrate as well if you want and thought you know charles is just in charge now and about four months later he says you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i said oh okay what did you do says oh there are all these immigration companies which are there and we can help you immigrate if you want and i will actually apply for you if you want you know i 'll know how to do it i 'll do it for you i said ah charles is being charged again so anyway i sat next to him as he punched in the computer and did all these things and uh about a month later i got a call from the townsville hospital and said you know we 've got your cv and all that and uh would you be interested in uh in in coming to work here oh oh dear this is actually serious so it can actually happen and then i sort of said to my wife you know this is what 's happening i 'm not really told that all this was happening in the background is all good men do i think you wait until things things are actually happening before you declare your hand and my my lovely wife is standing there just you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very good so i um then you know things started happening and before i knew it um i got a ticket to come here and i actually arrived in this country uh on the 25th of uh of april which was anzac day so i landed in sydney on that day and uh i was carrying two very heavy jackets you know like you know like those really deep winter jackets i i didn 't know you know where i was going is it hot is it cold what so i as i arrived in there you know i got into the airport there i found everybody waving flags the australian flag painted on there on their faces and then i was wow these people are very patriotic you know why why they 're moving around with flags and they 've got all this so i said you know what what 's going on why why are people and they say oh it 's a sunset day and i said what 's what 's anzac day it says mate where are you coming from so that was my introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know so once a day since then has held a very important place in my heart because that 's the day i actually landed in sydney and got and got into this country and and then like i said i was holding these two big jackets and one of the uh immigration people there says you know where are you going and i said i 'm going to townsville and then he said mate you will not even find one person to give those jackets to and i had no idea that you know it was it was actually a warm place as it is but uh having stayed in here now for about 15 years i 've acclimatized and i actually have got to to to enjoy this place a lot in the sense that you know i think it 's only december february march where it 's really quite steamy once we hit april mid-april may there it 's really lovely you know from may to november this place is the place to be so i 've really you know i 've really got to enjoy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and the storm indicated so tom was my first friend when i came here uh i was also looking out for africans as he as he said we all used to walk around and see are they are there any africans in this town and we didn 't see many that begged them so there was an african restaurant which was running in this town back then so i went there and left my name and said you know if you see any africans or anybody from zimbabwe give them my name and then uh about two weeks later tom called and he said you know i 'm talking i 'm from say oh i 'm chris i 'm also from zimbabwe then we we met up and before you know it the friendship was struck and our families got to know to know each other and you know 15 years later here we are 16 years later here we are and as i won 't go too much into the african festival story i think tommy has already uh got into that but it 's always been something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know when we came here we said you know how do we we my this is my daughter here terry terry you lift your head and say hello she was like uh what um two when when we came and then you know we 're kind of thinking ah you know it would be good to to try and make sure our kids maintain the culture and the as they assimilate and become a part of those cultures to be good for them to also retain some of our traditions and cultures and what better way than to try to start in an african group and start up an african festival in showcase culture into songs dance food and things like that because food was one of the difficult things we we tried we encountered when we came here you know we still want to retain those foods which we had at home we looked everywhere we couldn 't get them you know i think back then it wasn 't as easy to get all the things through the internet like what 's happening now now you can almost order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come you know that 's just how the world is at the moment so but back then it was very difficult to find you know like the step of food we eat back home it 's a maze pest best food called saga so we look for it everyone couldn 't now it 's in all the shops really you know in townsville at the moment but you know that was one of the one of the things we wanted to do make sure our kids continue to enjoy uh while they are simulating and becoming aussies they should also retain some of our culture and part of that like tom tom said was to start the african festival which has grown from year to year and as of other africans they 've come into into town as well you know we are about 200 zimbabweans in in this town and they 're about you know maybe about 120 kenyans uh they 're about one 140 or so nigerians they are about there are over 350 somali about 90 sudanese um the congolese make the biggest cohort of africans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also they 've been also a fairly sizable group from the central african public everybody have come in for different reasons and like tom said we came in you know with work but in some sense maybe we are economic refugees others have been political refugees their challenges of course on the continent will not pretend that uh there are no problems but uh like tom said there are also some good things which we 've been trying to showcase and and part of it is what we 're going to be doing here in the few minutes which we have to showcase a bit of the of the instruments and the bit of the music which we do enjoy so hopefully you will enjoy that um what i 'm holding up here is called embira it 's basically a a thumb piano that 's that 's the common kind of colloquial name for it but it 's actually called the lamellar phone that 's the proper name and uh it it 's it 's a very ancient traditional zimbabwean instrument uh which used to be played for in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going on uh in in people 's lives this was the instrument which we used to use for that but with a time and you know now it 's very much played in contemporary society before it only used to be played by men uh pretty much like they do do is done at the moment but now you know even women play it as well without without without much much issues so this is what it is it 's called a mirror and now we 're hoping that we 'll just play a little showcase song for you as well maybe we will just do that before we move on to to to the marimbas there so i 'll get my daughter here to come up and as i say daily on we 've been trying to to to teach them when titi came here she she obviously wasn 't playing but we 've introduced this to her and you know she 's playing a little bit as well at the moment so just play a little tune for you okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singing of this song will go it 's called champion i keep playing so this is how i 'll just sing maybe one or two verses [Music] [Music] so that was indira just showcasing you know like i said it 's an ancient traditional instrument and it 's a beautiful instrument and it 's actually now also being thought of and being used for meditation and years you can appreciate this with that beautiful echoing sound so there 's actually some research into trying to use this for for meditation as well and uh the final uh uh bit of instruments we 're going to showcase for you uh is called the the marimbas they 're basically xylophone instruments they also played a lot in our country and basically in the southern african region as well and i think in in in other societies as well they do have them with different names but we will just showcase two little tunes for you and that would be that would be it for us thank you very much for listening and then and uh entertaining us the first should we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who a little like a you know teenage girl who goes out and the parents are saying you know look you must come back home on in time if you don 't no one is going to open the door for you you 're going to sleep outside and i 'm sure many are familiar with this sort of her story and of course she she doesn 't come back on time and they do let they lock the door and then she bangs on it and they shooting the next thing which we will play after that is when the saints go matching and i 'm sure you 're all familiar with it we 'll ask you to clip along sing along and then just you know be part of it thank you [Music] so [Music] do [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Applause] thank you very much we 've been asked to do another shoot [Music] so this little chill we used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full moon and we draw a stick in the ground and then we 're jumping over it so that 's what the tune is saying is very come turn that so you jump the other side and then when the tune goes again you jump on the other side as well so you know if one of those full moon dances [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Applause] thank you very much you 've been a wonderful audience and i enjoyed the evening very lovely evening here tonight so thank you very much and uh aussie aussie aussie aussie

Carr,4ZhTGEfgth8,20210203,1052.08,"Townsville QLD 4810, Australia",2718,good evening my friends i 'm so glad to be here i was born in 1938 so i 've got about 80 odd years of memories to try and fit into 15 minutes so i 'll try and be as quickly quick as i can and as clear as i can my grandparents came from switzerland and ireland and they ran cattle out on the boli plains now they had a butcher shop in town the butcher shop was in stoke street just around the corner from where the cowboys entrance is now and it was called cannon and gun where the best people meet meat so that that was where my grandparents were they shifted into echo street in the early 1900s and luckily for me they chose a really good spot in anchor street because that part doesn 't flood the bottom end floods but the top end doesn 't flood that was 1900 and because of that there wasn 't any motor cars around and most people had horses and selkies so instead of getting one block of land they had two blocks and one block had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to use in those days so when i was about three or four i went and lived out on a fail farm in aikenvale it was my aunt and uncles and we would said we 'd go and stay out there for 12 months while they went away now when the 12 months was up they said would you like to buy the area and we said no it 's too far out of town there 's guinea grass and tiny apples and gum trees it was just too far the aikenvald pub was the last thing that you that you saw and it had a hitching rail for the for the horses anyway we didn 't we shifted into bowen road now in the future years that block of land became where they built the redemptorist monastery and now there 's the brookly retirement village on that same block so maybe i could have been a land owner after all but it didn 't work out that way when we shifted into bowen road that was uh the war years i remember the war years i remember being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sirens to the searchlights going around the planes flying overhead and the night the bombers dropped a bomb out on an umber uh killed a coconut tree but probably gave all the residents a bit of a fright too but uh we had a shelter down the back and we 'd run down there every night with all the little bits and pieces that you take down i started school there when i while i was there i went to saint joseph 's now saint joseph 's wasn 't called saint joseph 's really it was the church was blizzard oliver plunkett but the nuns were saint joseph nuns so that 's why we 've got two saint joey schools in townsville the saint joseph nuns ran that one the mercy sisters run the one down here at north ward uh when we shifted out to bowen road we were we 're on the corner where the spanish lace motel is now it 's a it 's a big area there but we were on the corner and we used to walk to school every day i had some very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dads they trained greyhounds together there were two greyhound tracks in townsville then there was and they were straight they didn 't run round and round like they do now they were straight tracks one was out behind the melanda milk depot and the other one was at the sports reserve yeah so that was that was a bit different in those days uh the people that we were very friendly with like i said the fathers had the grey hands our mums went to tennis together and us kids we went to tap dancing on a saturday morning and we 'd love to go up denham street making a lot of noise to the awu hall where we had our tap class afterwards we 'd come down and go to the old town hall news agency was anderson 's news agency and the mums would buy their magazines the kids would get a couple of comics and i liked superman and captain marvel they were my favorites we 'd get delicious pies from peter pan and then we 'd walk up to the winter garden theater and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ross river broke its bags and it came gushing down behind us and across bowen road and we were in a high house luckily but all the houses down the other end if they were low it was right up inside their houses we were watching very anxiously as the water was coming up our stairs and i saw things floating past little tables and jugs and plates and saucepans and stuff just getting washed away people 's people 's lives getting their furniture and everything getting just strong down away now the people next door they had race horses and to keep the racehorses on the highest part of ground they took them out and stood them on the crown of the road which was a high point on the way they had picked up this little old chinese lady in the shop across the road and they sat her on a racehorse in the middle of bowen road and she waited there until some boats came down and they eventually got rescued now our friends that lived in love 's lane their house went under also they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron off the roof and climb up onto the roof so there were two kids two greyhounds and the mum and dad and the dad had a broken leg and it was in plaster so that must have been a terrific ordeal for them and they sat on their roof until they were rescued so after the flood we came and shifted into accur street dad decided he 'd build a house or get a house built on the spare allotment next to granny 's place because that was just a garden now and the garage because there were no horses there anymore but i 'll tell you i 've found a few horseshoes in the backyard digging up in the garden and i keep them in the garden as little mementos so we were shifted into anchor street when the house was finished and always went to school then it 's at margaret mary 's as they were they were good days and i had all my school friends living close by i had aunties and cousins living next door and their friends were around and we were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to go up the road if we were home by a certain time and you only needed trippings or sixpence and you could get a a good packet of lollies got a old georgie leong shop and he used to boil his own salted peanuts in their shells they were yummy or you could get a big chunk of watermelon so then we go cross charters towers road into the side street beside the region theater now the region theater was open air so around the house on the corner which belonged to a building company called ap williams there was this lovely cement fence and they had a square block of cement about as big as this lectern and we could sit on there until we finished eating our goodies watching the movies uh lip reading of course because you couldn 't hear anything and then we 'd go home now we always had to be home within a certain time and we walked until we got to one particular house now this house had a spare allotment also they had a little bit fenced off in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a gravestone now we were pretty cleary kids so we worked out gravestone meant a body a body meant haunted so we walked we ran and we walked so that gave us a little bit of excitement for the night years later i found out that the gravestone was only a spelling error and they just ditched it there while they had another one done but it still made a good exciting night for us now about 10 years ago they started to demolish that fence they were going to shift the house and i went across the road and i said to the man oh look you know i used to sit on this fence when i was a kid you know any chance of getting one of those square blocks that i used to sit on and he looked at me he looked at the fence uh he looked back at me again you know what he said is it that old well he was the only the only one that thought it was a bit funny and all the other workmen around i didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with that block of cement and i 've got it in my garden today kids used to go to the pictures on a saturday afternoon and we got a really good value of those days we take it you 'd get god save the king you had to stand up for god save the king then you get the the news then you 'd get the cereal that gather or really gripping ending every week you had to go back and find out what happened you 'd get a couple of travelogues or shorts then you 'd get two pictures you have an interval in between if you wanted to go into the winter garden you had to catch the bus and that was a little bit extra expense so you fortified that by running around the theater after the movies collecting all the empty soft drink bottles lining up with the kids next door at the shop next door and getting the refunds and so you sometimes you 'd go home with a little bit more money than you than you went with there was another picture show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we didn 't go there in the daytime but if you went there overnight time and it rained you could run up the back and get underneath the cover but if you didn 't want to do that and the row in front of you is empty you just pull it over in front of you part of it and put your nose through while you watch the movie while the rain came down now the rain didn 't last for long but that rainy nights and sunny days took a bit of a toll on the cement on there sorry the canvas and sometimes after they stood up for god save the king and plonked back down in the seats you 'd hear this big loud ripping noise and a scream and everybody would laugh because they knew what happened one of the seats had given way i don 't think anybody got seriously hurt because they weren 't that far off the ground but you just scuttled along uh tried to hope nobody saw who it was that was ended up on the floor five minutes okay now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uh one of the poems that i read that that i wrote uh it was called the old days in frinda street and i 'd like to read it to you now i have some of these books for sale afterwards later on after the the lights and everything have been on so now they 'll talk about the flinders street memories does anyone remember the days before the mall with heatless and mckimmons and of course the old town hall the antique elevator with the folding wire doors where i spent some anxious moments stuck between the floors the flash flamingo curtain on theater royal stage revealed the showtime splendor unfolding history 's page the gaieties and sawleys and ron rico making fools we also watch the concerts for the many local schools the heady smell of bacon as we trod the wooden floors along the oils in manahan 's no air condition stores on saturdays the roxy was alive with kids in song with uncle norm and auntie val and gracie played along we 'd sing our songs and fortio provided sugared buns who cared if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue bird for a milkshake ethel 's in for scones and teas spaghetti was great at cafe supreme and lanes for pies and peas no traffic lights just silent cops to guide you but i betcha if you rode your bike without a light the old white ghost would get you that 's what they call the police car was a white holden the 60s saw us at the dance a great place for romancing rock and roll and the blackout waltz not a bit like dirty dancing although i love dull flinders street the lot i can 't recall but when i stroll my heart is glad because i love the flinders more now i sent that into letters to the editor and people wrote in and they said you didn 't mention this one you didn 't mention that one so i wrote a sequel beakhouse and pennings and parlings cummins and campbell 's and alfred shores green and rawkins are marty 's and duffels who remembers these wonderful stores like a colorful little aladdin 's cave with materials stuck to the top dressmakers for bridal parties made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market or to jaunty for casual gear then for sandals and shoes whatever you choose aspinals and fosters were near from curtains to corsets at english smiths they had a mighty big range your money whizzed up in the flying fox then zoomed down to you with the change newlyweds were newlyweds were found shopping at bucassefs for tables and chairs and some rugs an lsd was a menswear store not hallucinating drugs we 'd all buy our push bikes from pages go to dancers railway canteen i attended a few at the awu flying squadron and the old bowling green the bulletin lived in a nightclub and once was the evening star there were buses till light every evening which was great when you don 't have a car under the stars at the olympia the picture 's exciting and gripping but then there 's a shout and the laughter rings out to the sound of a canvas chair ripping i know there 's lots more i should mention thanks for sharing my journey through time but i get so almighty frustrated when i 'm searching for words that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why didn 't i mention them all it seems you can 't please everybody thinking what was before fenders mall brooklyn 's jewelers for marker seat watches ramble in bright ways add to the tail i was too young to know all the hotels and carols were having a sale they had a sale every week keep our memories alive with nostalgia much more precious than fortuna war now if i 've not said your favorite writer write a blanky letter yourself thank you my time is up so god bless and dream in color bye please i 'll come back here later with my books if anybody wants to try any or look at them thank you,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

4810, Australia",1898,my name is darren butler and i 'm a local aboriginal man and my traditional land is from hinchenbrook island and dunk island and no surrounding areas and years ago my people used to live out on on the reef the great barrier reef 200 miles out before the sea level rose and we 've still got old stories from out there without when our people were coming back to the islands and we have a very strong connection with the with the reef at the great barrier reef and in this and all the oceans and all the animals that live amongst us um our traditional name for hinchenbrook island is mara mudanami uh dunk island kunangalba and tamana island baby badara mother so they 've still got all their traditional names we have all those things um we 've got tree climbing kangaroos that live on our island in the rainforest we 've got fish traps there that are older like than the pyramids in egypt they 're welded together by oysters we still use them today and and my people we have a very strong association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to swim from ireland to islands uh using the the great currents that rushed through the hinchenbrook to the dunk island group and yeah it would have been a really good way of life living that way again but unfortunately i can 't and yeah um so hinchenbrook island is is like my clan group where i we 're the salt water clan group for the waraga my group in ingham so we 're attached to those guys but we 're the salt water group and what we have with since the early 90s we have um we 've been protecting our turtles and dugons so we 've stopped all the hunting so no one hunts turtles or dugons around the hincheon brook island area and now they 've came back in great numbers and thriving very and doing very well and one day we might lift the ban and start hunting again but i feel we don 't need to i love looking at those animals swimming around it tells me that everything is healthy the the ocean is healthy you know i love it when i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past and i say to myself the water 's healthy this is beautiful i love seeing this yes and another thing that we have in place we we have a tamra it 's called a tamra a traditional use of marine resources agreement and that 's with the great barrier reef marine park authority so you know we help in with scientific studies and with the management of the marine park and we 've also have ranges that we have nine rangers aboriginal rangers sea rangers that look after our sea country we have boats and all that kind of stuff they go out and do patrols they can book people so if you see a bunch of black followers and a boat come for you they can book you and they 've got range again yes so yeah so they 're fully qualified these guys to do all that kind of stuff um and protect and protect all our all our land all our sea country yeah that 's our ancient land and like and why i love my sea country is because i know i 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewel in that 's my ancient land so when we die that 's where my spirit goes it goes back out there to my people out there uh i think your spirit goes to heaven mine doesn 't it goes there oh yeah so and and i might um tell you a bit of a story this is a rainforest story because i 'm a rainforest aboriginal and also a sea faring aboriginal from a rainforest islands and this story starts all the way up in cooktown and it 's about this big rock up here um [Music] castle hill but he 's got other names um kotaringa is one that 's his real name and it 's a dingo that 's the last dingo out that could live in the rainforest and it 's he started all the way up up in cooktown and the last kangaroo in the rainforest is over there where cape cleveland when you look over cape cleveland you 'll see like a little round thing on the end that 's the kangaroo with just his head sticking out of the water and the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rainforest he came down from cooktown and he came down to cairns and you see the pyramids you know the pyramid mountain there well it 's real name is jerrigan and that means turkey nest you know the little scrub turkey that runs around the bush like that him so that 's that 's his nest and that 's where the dingo came in around there and he chased the kangaroo all the way down here because this is the end of the rainforest just out the back here where blue water so the dingo chased him out here and the kangaroo he jumped out into the water and he 's got his head sticking out of the water and his whole body is under the water like that and and the dingo he will sit there and wait and this is a law for our children not to go in the water with kangaroos all right that 's why the dog is sitting there because he knows if he jumps in the water with that kangaroo what that kangaroo gonna do to him he 's got really strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag you under the water lift his hind legs and he 'll empty your belly into the ocean or in the waterhole wherever you are so if you ever see a kangaroo in the water he 's not drowning that 's his protection against predators so that story is about that that 's why that 's there and that 's why kate clinton 's there yeah okay yeah all right um and i 've got another story um do you ever do you know why the uh the curly thing 's out at night you know how he sings out makes that noise you just do all right um i 'll tell you this one this is an old story from from my country um why the curly cries is because imagine a hill like this here up in that hill there was a cave and in the cave lived an owl and he had a pet dingo and one day they were looking down and they could see a curlu family there and down the bottom there was a billabong as well and the curlews family they had you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curly so the curly mum and dad they were thirsty it was really hot so they said here you chicks use wait here we 're gonna go down to the billabong have a drink and we 're gonna come back and so the chicks they waited there and the owl he was watching he was watching the curlew 's mum and dad go down to the river and he said to the dingo go down there and grab me those chicks i want to eat them and so the dingo did he jumped up he ran down grabbed them flinging them around everywhere feathers everywhere took them back up give them to the owl and they sat in there and ate them and then when the mum and daddy curlew come back um they looked around and they 've seen feathers everywhere and they 're wondering where 's where 's my babies gone and so the father he followed he followed the dingo tracks all the way back to the cave and when he got to the cave he stood out the front he said dingo i want my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give my babies back i 'm going to kill you but the l he was silent and the dingo was silent as well [Music] so he went up the next day and he marched around up the front he was dancing everything singing out to that dingo and the owl to come out and fight him because he wants his babies back and after about the third or fourth day he said to the owl and the dingo he said all right please don 't want to fight me and then he seen a kangaroo running past and he sung out to the kangaroo he said here come back here can you help me mr kangaroo and the kangaroo said all right what you want me to do i can help you and he goes and he told him the story of how the the dingo and the owl took his babies and he 's asking the kangaroo can he help him and the kangaroo said okay what do you want me to do and the kangaroo said no the father curly said i want you to lay out front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to draw that dingo out and when he comes out chasing you you run down past that big tree the big fig tree down the bottom and i 'll be standing there with my big rain forest sword and so the kangaroo said all right i can do that that 's pretty easy so he was there laying around eating the grass and you know just relaxing and you know and after about the second day the dingo he couldn 't take it anymore you know he was hungry again and he said he 's got up and he come bolton out of the cave flat out and the kangaroo hurt him they got really good here and he jumped up real quick and he he jumped straight down the hill and he ran down past the fig tree and the father curler he was there and he split him in the head with his with his rainforest sword and the dingo just fell down he was dead so the uh curlew he dropped his rainforest sword and he marched up to the top of the cave and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owl i just killed your dingo and now i 'm going to kill you get out here now and fight me and in the owl he didn 't say a word he was quiet and so the so the curly said to him all right then if you don 't want to come out here and fight me i 'm going to banish you to the darkness forever and you 'll never ever see the light of day and that 's why the pure white owl he 's putting himself together written every day yeah all right you,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

linda 's here too so it 's our northern story see those lights are bright um so i grew up in brisbane and in 1989 i joined the army so i wanted to learn to fly and i was really fortunate that after i graduated i was selected to fly a black hawk helicopter you can see there and we were posted to townsville we 'd never been up in the north we had no idea what we 're getting into and it was a defining and probably the best thing that ever happened to us because we ended up being here uh those of you who 've been around for a while can remember that the skies used to be dark with black hawks but um we came up and uh i i learned to fly i was qualified and then the first thing they did i thought it was going to be exciting they sent us off on combat survival school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a really difficult environment we spent weeks in different places eating not much beyond insects and i really need that after christmas at the moment i can tell you but um just as pricey said what struck me what 's amazed me is that we did desert survival we did jungle survival we did seacoast we did islands we did everything we could it was all within half an hour an hour of townsville and it was just struck me about what an incredible place this really is and what a great adventure we 're going to have here uh we did have some quite good adventures because the first year we were here there was a cyclone and it was a particularly big one it was in 1990 and it was called uh cyclone joy and for those of you who might remember back that far and it it formed in the solomon islands and it tracked towards cairns and it set off cans just before christmas and then the day before christmas it suddenly turned at category five and headed for townsville and i remember that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes townsville joy for christmas so i learned a lot more about what about in the city rivalry in the north as well that year but i came home and said to linda it looks like there 's going to be a bad cyclone um i have to go and take a blackhawk helicopter and we have to fly off out west somewhere where it 's really safe and then after the cyclone 's gone we 'll come back and clean up all the mess and she said what about me and the baby i said well they didn 't mention you so uh talking about adventures pearl lynn got left on her own for the to face her first cyclone but then after that things have changed a lot more and we started to go from there so it was an amazing experience and we spent a lot of time flying here and one of the great experiences i had was flying from townsville to perth for exercises and it doesn 't sound much to us but it 's actually further than london to moscow and a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ london to moscow you 're going to see an awful lot of people an awful lot of history and an awful lot of really big cities when we did it you overfly six towns and seven deserts it was two and a half days in a black hawk and to stop ourselves getting bored we would have competitions counting uh kangaroos or emus or in fact camels but uh we you know we started doing a lot of flying we were doing some really interesting stuff with night vision goggles in the early days and i ended up training with special operations with the sas and it was people used to say that it turned night into day and it didn 't it was uh it was really demanding and sometimes very dangerous and one night that uh i certainly won 't forget was the 12th of of june 1996 uh the unthinkable happened and we had a horrific accident we had a mid-air collision between the two aircraft uh i was flying one and it was um we we ended up having losing lots of bits of the aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 of the 28 people on board were killed and if you look at that photo up there you can see that 's all that was left of the aircraft um there there 's just a couple of molten rivers of of uh metal flowing down along the ground the it was so intense the heat from what was happening there it was a difficult disturbing time but what it 's working again maybe i 've walked too far away so um what what was the defining thing for this for me that changed the way that i saw the north i saw townsville and and really might change the way i thought about life a lot was the incredible support that we got from the community in the people of townsville it as i said it was really difficult it it was a long process but everywhere we went there were always people who would say hello they come up in the street and say that 's a tough thing mate we 're here to help you just people who lived in the street that we didn 't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing that i think the thing that that better not go too far away that 's it yes okay i might be covering the antenna with my big hand so you learn something every day okay so um what happened was uh as this went on uh it was interesting to hear what pricey was just saying before about uh the young gala being a tomb and when you think of people going through these tragedies and people dying and there being no memorial the people of townsville brought it upon themselves to think that these people these young men members of the sas members of the helicopter regiment many of them not from townsville but had died here that they needed something to remember them by and i don 't know if you 've been out to the palmetton but there is an incredible memorial out there it 's absolutely beautiful and this was uh the it was built and the idea came from the people of townsville the money was raised by the community i can remember being out at the cowboys in 1996 it was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually was a hill you could go and sit on the grass and have a beer and and sit and watch the game and people were coming out and passing buckets around and collecting money and uh in the end the money was raised and there was a um a contribution from the townsville city council and in 1997 this magnificent memorial was um dedicated and it 's still there today it 's uh if you ever get a chance i 'd recommend going out there it 's a very special place it 's in a very beautiful garden and around the outside there are 18 palm trees and it 's very symbolic when i see it because i remember when we first went there they were when it was first put in there were very small trees but now uh as you can see there 's a couple of in the photo they 're very large uh very thick girth trees that represent the passing of time i guess and and lives not lived but uh it 's still a place i like to go back to but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everybody by the community of townsville but it 's not all bad uh you know we all we all go through some tough times but after that i uh you know we we went on and i can honestly say that my time in the military in my time as a helicopter pilot i have been or we have been so blessed in some of the places that we 've been to live and some of the things we 've that we 've seen there were you know tough and demanding times when we 've had to go on operations and i i 've you know been to east timor and to middle east various places around there and but it 's something that you do with pride and the fact that you um that we have done the things we had to do to support our country and protect our country and when i say we it 's a real family commitment to do that but along the way we also had some amazing experiences we had a lot of international postings and i remember that linda has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of your friends and our friends and they 're living in london paris new york why is it that we have ended up in damascus jerusalem islamabad and enterprise alabama and said well i guess we 're just lucky because even though they um the these places are not the sort of really romantic international places you 'd think of that we had some unbelievable experiences saw some amazing things and met the most incredible people now that photo there is from our last posting i had the pleasure of uh and the honor of studying at the national defence university in pakistan and then i was the um the uh defense attache for three years and who would have ever thought that i would be standing next to this incredibly uh looking gentlemen uh at the base of the himalayas where china afghanistan and pakistan come together it was just a place called the hunza valley and you know somewhere like pakistan who 'd have thought that besides being really good cricketers they uh they have the second highest mountain in the world they have deserts and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we our children uh were given the opportunity to travel we had one trip where we we promised them we 'd take them on a safari to kenya and then we were invited by our swedish friends to go skiing and we thought well you know what let 's do it anyway so we ended up traveling with two bags one full of really hot weather stuff to go traveling around looking at lines in kenya and then we jumped on a plane at nairobi and flew up to sweden and then went up skiing in the swedish norwegian border and before we flew back to to jerusalem and they were just you know amazing incredible experiences but then unfortunately with the passage of time as much as i enjoyed what i was doing it it came time to start thinking about doing something else after 30 years as much i 'd like to keep flying you just start to get a little bit too old and you need to start thinking about doing something else so i retired last year oh goodness me it 's it 's 21 already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because even though linda and i had grown up in brisbane we 'd we 'd ended up living all over australia and all over the world and then we thought where do we go where 's home and you know what it didn 't take very long for us to make a decision about where we would live and you know a lot of that goes back to that um time i was talking about and the the memorial and and the the warmth and and and the real genuine care that we got from the community in townsville i think that was a turning point because townsville is unique in a lot of places that i have lived around the world there is this incredible bond and relationship between the australian defense force and the people and the community especially when you spend a career flying really noisy helicopters late at night people are always complaining about the noise when we go down south they 're worried about what 's happening but when you come and you fly in townsville people are happy to hear that noise they really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community that we really felt a part of the the great thing about it too was the weather but when we were coming back we um said we raised a family here and we had um our son and daughter but they 're now in just turning 30. but we 've got a new family and i 've got a photo of the new family up on the wall up on the floor there so they are two pakistani street dogs they were rescued off the streets of islamabad and the one on the left is uh chile she 's a indian pariah dog they 're a very ancient breeder dog and i she was running around and she was having rocks thrown at her and people were kicking her with not to do so i brought her home and the the idea was that she would just live in our house and she would patrol the grounds and keep us safe at night and live outside and be this wild street dog who would keep us safe i came home and linda had knitted her an aqua pullover and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resplendent in her aqua pullover and her name i was going to call it chamundra which was the hindi goddess of war vengeance and retribution linda called her matilda and so matilda in her aqua pullover wasn 't exactly what i had anticipated but she is a fabulous dog we call it tilly for short because we 're australians and we always cut everything short but um the staff that we had we had lots of pakistanis who we worked with and they didn 't understand we were saying tilly and they called it chili so chilly it has become and the other one i was going to say one of them 's chili and one of them 's yoda i was going to say which one 's yoda it 's not hard to tell that we inherited her from our south african friends and she 's a saluki cross and it was ridiculous to bring pay a huge amount of money and bring these dogs back but you know what they were our family and we 're thinking where where else would the slumdog millionaires after what they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well so now they have just had the most wonderful time when pricey was talking about are there any new north queenslanders or northerners well these are two new northerners and they are absolutely fascinated who knew that kangaroos and wallabies were put on this place when they 're out the back and we go for a walk they think they 're just the most amazing things you 've ever seen that um you know after all of this time when you go through the experiences we 've had and we 've seen places that do it tough um if you look at the coronavirus around the world at the moment we 've got friends overseas who are literally hiding in their houses in fear because a thousand people a day are dying in their countries we live in a place we are so blessed we are happy we are prosperous we are safe and we are healthy and i think that we can just never be appreciative and understand what a great place it is i 'm so glad that all those years ago we were posted up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i would rather call home thank you very much enjoy the show this evening and thank you for taking the time to listen to me,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

4810, Australia",1695,[Music] i came to australia in 2005 as a tourist and i had a working holiday visa for a year traveled around and i fell in love with the country first of all with the countryside i love the wide open spaces the queensland outback and the pilbara in wa i love the pleasant weather all year round and the longer i was here and got to know the australian people i love their easygoing way of life their give it a go attitude and then i fell in love with the man who is now my husband so by the end of 2010 i had packed up all my belongings in germany and came to townsville to live we got married in 2000 2011. i grew up in east germany near the czech border in a christian family my grandmother was a church musician and that is the profession that i later chose for myself i studied protestant theology and church music in berlin and halle and before i came to australia i had a position as a church musician in a small town in saxony andhold close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as my private life was full of music i was in charge of choirs and instrumental ensembles for the parish and i loved going to concerts of chamber music and oratorios now there is a difference between coming to a foreign country for a year and actually migrating to another country for good it is a big step and it takes some time to put down roots in the new place for me the easiest way to connect with people in townsville was again through music during my first years i explored all the performances and productions that townsville has to offer and i came to admire the vast variety that we have here we have the berry reef orchestra several concert bands um community choirs the musical theater scene is stunning in townsville and then of course we have the australian festival of chamber music for me a big highlight every year 10 days of fine world-class music and in terms of spiritual connections i found a new home here saint james cathedral and that is also again for mainly musical reasons the acoustics here the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protestant tradition that i came from i was fortunate to be offered a position as a piano teacher at the townsville grammar school and through my work in schools i came to realize how much talent there is amongst our young people here and i thought we should have more opportunity for the public to see and hear these young people not just in their school environment so i started some on little initiatives in 2014 i founded the community children 's choir the amadeo singers and since may 2015 i 've been organizing concerts here at saint james to give these young people a possibility to perform and more so for the public to come and see them so all these little steps contributed for my feeling of feeling more and more at home here but there 's always a sense of there 's still something missing and i tried to pin that down what what that is i realized i missed the experience of the bigger works for choir and orchestra that church cantatas auditorius and masses and that became especially apparent last year during the lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities or even overseas and at the same time during the lockdown i thought about all the families who had lost someone and couldn 't gather for funerals in an appropriate manner and all the people who lost their jobs because of the restrictions so putting those two things together i thought we should sing a requiem when all this is over and immediately gabriel foreign came to my mind i had sung it in berlin in my 20s it 's just such comforting music and it reaches the heart of many people no matter whether they are christian or not at that time last year march april i thought surely this nightmare is going to be over in a few months and since it 's a tradition to sing a requiem on or around all souls day at the beginning of november i thought that 's perfect timing we will have enough time to find people to be involved to rehearse it properly and then have a performance here it 's in james with the organ as essential part of the ensemble the choir and orchestra in the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of up to 300 people at least under normal circumstances i had done a few smaller projects of church music in townsville before but nothing of that caliber yet thankfully i received funding through the regional arts development fund it 's a collaboration between the queensland government and townsville city council and because of that i could go out and invite people to sing in the choir and players to play in the orchestra and we started rehearsals at the end of august now as we all know restrictions did not ease in time things have not gone back to normal even until now in late september i had two options i could have abandoned the whole project but so much work and time had gone into it by then and people started to love the piece so i decided to look into the other option of recording the piece and making it accessible for people to watch online that was a big task because of the distancing rules we had to spread out the orchestra and the choir so that everyone was 1.5 meters apart from each other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to remove all the pews out of the church and use the whole space in the nave and they then posed another problem um because of the huge distance especially between the orchestra and the choir people could not rely on hearing everything they really had to make sure everyone knew their part really well we had 40 singers in the adult choir and for the final piece in paradisum i also invited the children 's choir to sing along and we had about 25 players in the orchestra that was a good thing about recording i did not have to restrict numbers in the ensemble all the participants came from towns were all from towns in regional queensland we had visitors from long reach and prosupine and air to be part of it we had participants of all ages and also of different musical ability i really like the aspect of collaboration between the younger participants singing and playing alongside professional musicians and music teachers and by recording it we actually reached a much bigger audience than we would have been able to with just one live performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course i had connections already and knew a few people who would definitely sing in the choir and then they invited friends and that 's how it got bigger um everyone probably knows the famous piece pierre yeso and that 's written for soprano soprano solo or trapezoidal and i decided um to have a boy soprano i knew benjamin zarnia from my children 's choir he was part of the ahmadiyya singers some years ago and i remembered him as having a beautiful voice and it 's actually almost the last time he can sing this piece because his voice is starting to change so it was special for him first of all to be part of the project and also to be able to sing it the other soloist in the piece is a baritone solo and i have been working with pompeo kaluya over last year 's he is actually the director of the youth choir now and i i had worked with him for the afcm and knew that he has a beautiful voice and that 's why i invited him to be the baritone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier reef orchestra um i had played with a few of them already but not with all of them so um the people who are now they brought other people in as well and that 's where this person came from proserpine someone knew him and asked him would you like to be part of it and he was very excited to come along i 'm extremely proud of everyone who participated in this project i 'm actually still quite amazed that we did it and that people trusted me to see through i think that 's that comes back to the australian attitude of give it a go first of all but i think it 's also a result of all the relations that have been established over the past years and i 'm grateful that townsville accepted me as part of the community and i 'm glad that i can contribute to the well-being of the community i feel i have found my place here and i truly feel at home we have a church possum i think it lives in the in the organ and sometimes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the recording we recorded for the whole day and then after we recorded the whole piece we did a little performance for just for family members just the choir and organ and that 's when the person came down and ran through the choir yeah i 'm looking forward to the future and i 'm curious to see what the next projects will be but having said that um i think this requiem project is not quite finished yet we still have it in our plans to have live performance for live [Music] audience,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

QLD 4810, Australia",2278,so i was a career soldier for just short of 28 years i grew up in brisbane went to high school in redcliffe where i was in army cadets when i joined the army 92 i went through recruit training down at wagga wagga where i was allocated to the core of royal australian engineers different types of common engineering so bridges roads water purification demolitions in 2003 i made the decision to specialise in the area of explosive ordnance disposal in layman 's terms it 's the military 's version of the bomb squad in 1998 i deployed to bougainville my main job over there was water purification very exciting to get that opportunity to deploy overseas for the first time that was actually quite a good trip you get to see a different side of life though you know throughout all the briefings you 're told that be prepared that it 's like a third-world country everything 's been destroyed but you don 't really understand that until you actually land on the ground when i was dealing when i was purifying water a lot of the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and you play games with them and yeah so i deployed to bougainville one month before i got married so that was a quite interesting time for helene she had to plan the wedding uh and deal with all that side of it by herself when i 'm in another country trying to help the locals your first deployment like biggerville gets you ready for what you 're going to expect to see it wasn 't much better so the people that you feel sorry for the most when you go into these countries are the kids but it 's always the kids that seem to have the best outlook on life it 's situations like that where you start to have an understanding of the sacrifices that are made by people in the adf you are so driven to to serve something bigger than yourself and that 's probably the biggest reason why you join the iraq deployment was extremely different to the first two deployments that i had where it was a war-torn country a lot of civil unrest a lot of damage the risk was extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adf suppose there was no armored vehicles so our vehicle was a uh an army land rover with tarps on the side that we would just roll up uh there was three of us in the team we had a halftime trail on the back of the back of the rover that was that was it to transport all of our explosive ordnance that we could move our only protection was body armor and our weapons we had american exports to the front and back of us and two humvees as soon as the sun was up we were driving out of the gate to go and deal with a room full of ordnance and it could have been surface air missiles at a surface artillery mines any personnel mines any tank mines the first job was a semi-trailer that was just full of all different types of munitions that had been shot by a tank and it just threw munitions everywhere maybe 200 by 200 meters in the middle of baghdad you 've got the nerves are going you 're shaking so and there was a mixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the local insurgency had gone in there and started to booby-trap stuff as well because they saw us going back in there day after day i suppose the most difficult part of iraq was it was just a constant state of readiness so you were hyper-vigilant all the time i 'd be on the phone to helene back to the family and she could hear the faint sound of explosions in the background where there 'd be a battle or americans were bombing something or the insurgency were we 're trying to hit vehicles or whatever you want to be able to help people serve the country you want to want to try and make a difference and it 's moments like that when you start missing birthdays and and births or tragedies and families as well like there 's been deaths and helene 's family that i haven 't been down to come haven 't been able to come back for because i 've been in a highly specialised role the best moment from iraq i suppose would be we 're doing our second job which was once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locals had been trying to get rid of uh they were so happy though that there was finally someone there to take the ordinance away that this little girl came up to us with flowers and gave us flowers as a gesture of of of thanks that was uh yeah i suppose that moment will probably stay with me forever because it 's just those little things and the next deployment was to afghanistan with reconstruction tax force iii i was a part of the erd team that was a different type of deployment again so that was our main job over there was to neutralize and render safe the it 's always interesting to walk towards a device that 's in the ground and you don 't have a clue what it is you never got bored of using explosives so it didn 't matter how many times we would use explosives it was always like the rush of yeah we 're blowing something up against that was pretty cool so that was pretty cool so the uh that we always had a catch cry that we would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what that is on camera because it involves you know a bit of swearing and stuff but it was it was all good we did get a uh a break to come home on that on that deployment so i find that to be hard today for the families because you come home especially for young kids you come home you spend time with the kids and then you 're gonna try and you 're only home for about 10 days i think it is then you 've got to try and explain to your young kids that you 've got to go back over again but once again you 're doing it because you believe in the in a greater cause i then got posted to sydney to special operations command where i um we did numerous roles there so tag east so counter-terrorism east uh here in australia and then i did two deployments to afghanistan with um within that command as well there is no ambient light anywhere so it 's just dark it 's like i 've never seen anything so dark in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments for those was being able to talk to the family so because we 're constantly out on mission so you 'd be out for your mission would go anywhere from four days to two weeks and you 'd only you 'd only be back from each mission time just to refit the vehicles and your your equipment so you couldn 't just pick up a phone or get on the internet to speak to your family there 's a lot that you can 't say so the kids don 't really understand it they want to know what you 're doing but you don 't want to tell them what you 're doing because you see a lot of you see a lot of evil i suppose is probably the best way to explain it you see how evil people can be to each other that 's probably the downside of the job you 're constantly on a high so you 're on a high for nine months because those two last trips overseas but for nine months and no breaks even back at the camp sometimes the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurgents as well my mind was constantly ticking over because i was also the search commander as well you would you 'd have to decide when you got the searches out to search or you don 't have that ability to switch off for a night or for a period of time and the effect that that has on the mind body and soul is that after nine months of being hyper vigilant and then you come home you can 't turn that hyper vigilance off so you come home you go and leave you then go back to work and then you start going through the pre-deployment training again the security briefs the intelligent briefs the way that you train your guys can be the difference between bringing everyone home or not bringing everyone home so that 's constantly back your mind as well so in 2019 i was at work i was in brisbane at the time posted to brisbane had a massive meltdown at work where everyone went into a bit of a mad panic and they rushed me to the hospital being treated by psychiatrists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the reason for my departure from from army the hardest thing to accept from that is the abrupt halt to your career you found to be not fit for service anymore due to the traumas that you 've been exposed to over your lifetime of service i suppose is the best way to to put it the effect that it has on me now is that i don 't like crowds i don 't like loud noises i don 't like a lot of background noises you you tend to absorb the energy of the room which then sends your hypervigilance through the roof you want to leave you distance yourself from people and from events you just want to stay home there were warning signs but you just you just put it down to being tired overworked i think it did blindside us a bit so you know you have job trouble sleeping but you put it down to like because the higher up in the ranks that you go the expectations get higher and higher and higher and the workload gets bigger when i had my breakdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldn 't stop and that was the moment where all my mates at work this went oh my god what 's going on and uh but they were really good all my mates are really good to uh to help me and and take me to the hospital to the base hospital to get me to start this whole new journey that i 'm on now uh i got told that i had high functioning depression so if you have an individual that keeps himself super busy is constantly putting their hand up to do stuff taken on a lot of different roles outside of their designated role that can be a good thing but you need to look at maybe why are they doing that stuff that i 've noticed from soldiers that i 've helped in the past as well is that if their performance all the sudden starts to drop a situation where you probably need to have that one-on-one discussion the ranks taken off the table so they 're just talking to you like a human like a an equal is probably the best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since i joined the army about the effects the injuries on the mind you lack the knowledge of it unless you 've lived it i believe so i 've been living this dream since about february 2019 so it does get better um with the assistance of your family and the specialists specialist doctors and stuff like that as well and your mates that have the same deployed type experience are probably the only ones that you can really talk to in detail about you know this is what 's this is what i witnessed or i 'm more aware now of warning signs that i 'm starting to feel a certain way and helene is awesome with that as well and so are the girls the effect that has had on me though is that i 'll never be able to work full time again i i can 't handle the pressure so for me pressure time pressure or multiple pressures for me are going to be are one of those things that i just now need need to live with i 'm a a veteran of 28 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm still just an

years of spiritual connection with land and sea country and i would like to pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging [Music] the great barrier reef marine park authority is an australian government agency responsible for protecting the great barrier reef we do this in collaboration with the queensland government and one of our primary tools is what we call our zoning plan this is a plan that essentially says what activities you can do out there on the reef in different places and that is run through our field management program with the queensland government we have rangers and vessels out there on the water making sure that people are following those rules and that 's a really important part of protecting our great barrier reef through our great barrier reef marine park i 'm the chief scientist at the great barrier reef marine park authority and i work with a team of other technical and scientific professionals here to make sure that the work we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best possible scientific advice townsville and north queensland are actually a world leader in coral reef science and management we 're famous everywhere throughout the tropics of the world for doing world-class coral reef science and natural resource management back in the 1970s and 1980s marine science and coral reef management really took off in townsville with the formation of james cook university the australian institute of marine science and the great barrier reef marine park authority between those three institutions over the succeeding decades townsville became a world leader and world famous for excellent science and excellent coral reef management the great barrier reef is one of the most amazing spectacular and beautiful ecosystems on our planet it is an economic powerhouse supporting billions of dollars in economy tens of thousands of jobs it is an essential component of the spiritual connection of our traditional owners to their land and sea country it 's a part of the north queensland and australian identities and it 's a scientific marvel having said all of that the great barrier reef is under pressure particularly from growing impacts from climate change we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat waves that have caused a lot of damage to the reef but that damage is not everywhere and it 's not equal and the reef remains a resilient ecosystem and it 's that resilience that we 're working incredibly hard to try and protect that resilience is the key to the future of the great barrier reef there are essentially three different levels at which people can help protect the great barrier reef if you 're somebody who actually goes out onto the reef to fish go boating diving snorkeling then please make sure that you follow the marine park rules and the fisheries rules and please make sure that you don 't leave behind any rubbish if you live next to the great barrier reef in the catchment then please make sure that you don 't put any chemicals or similar things down the drains because those will find their way out onto the reef eventually but in fact anyone anywhere on planet earth can help protect the future of the great barrier reef because the greatest threat to the reef is climate change so no matter who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce your greenhouse gas emissions in your home or your business then you will be helping to control climate change and you will be helping to deliver a better future for the great barrier reef the great barrier reef is an amazing asset for us and for future generations but that means that when we 're out there in the marine park it 's our responsibility to behave sustainably and look after it for us that really means if you 're visiting the great barrier reef marine park please be reef smart that means follow the rules of the zoning plan particularly in relation to fishing please be very careful how you anchor your boat and in particular never put your anchor down on coral and last but not least please do not put any litter or food scraps over the side of your boat into the marine park if you can be reef smart you will be helping us to protect the great barrier reef for the future when i was a young boy growing up in london my parents were keen scuba divers and i learned to dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on reefs since my earlier years and in fact i was eight when i told my parents that i wanted to be a marine biologist i think they thought that was pretty cute and that i would probably want to be an astronaut or a fireman the next week but the truth is i stuck with it i studied marine biology at university i did a phd on coral reefs but when i really fell in love was when i came to townsville in north queensland and i saw the great barrier reef for the first time and the great barrier reef blew my mind it is such an incredible huge diverse and beautiful seascape and landscape with the islands that i was immediately captivated and i fell in love and since then in the early 1990s i 've dedicated my professional life to protecting the great barrier reef my absolute number one favorite thing about the great barrier reef is that it is impossible to pick a favorite thing about the great barrier reef it 's huge it 's unbelievably diverse there 's about 3 000 different coral reefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marine park is bigger than two-thirds of the countries on planet earth it 's so huge and so diverse that even though i 've lived here for 28 years and have snorkeled and dived on the reef many thousands of times every time i go out there i see something new i see something that surprises me and takes my breath away so what i love most about the reef is that you can 't pick one thing it 's a new experience every time and there 's always a surprise the great barrier reef marine park authority was created by australian parliament in 1975 and the whole reason that the authority exists is the protection of the great barrier reef on behalf of the australian people and indeed on behalf of all the people of the world that 's why we 're here that 's our job but protecting the great barrier reef has an extremely important personal pipe for me as well my daughter just turned 15 and she learned to dive when she was 12. she and i have been diving on the great barrier reef at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time through her eyes for me is like seeing the wreath again for the first time myself and it really has reinspired my passion for protecting the great barrier reef because i know that the great barrier reef is not just important for us in this generation but it 's important for our children our grandchildren and unborn generations into the future so it 's our responsibility now to protect the reef for people into the future one of our focuses here at the great barrier reef marine park authority is to make sure that we educate people about the values of the great barrier reef the threats to the great barrier reef and what everybody can do to help protect it we do this in all sorts of different ways we work with traditional owners of the great barrier reef we work with schools particularly our reef guardian schools we work a lot with communities so we have a whole series of local marine advisory committees up and down the coast of the great barrier reef where we talk to local community but obviously these days we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media so we spread the word globally we even use video conferencing to connect with people schools universities in all parts of the world and we 're very much trying to spread the word that the great barrier reef is an absolutely amazing place but it is under pressure and we do need stronger action both locally and globally on climate change to protect this amazing natural wonder one of the most amazing things about the great barrier reef is the connection of the traditional owners of the great barrier reef to their land and sea country these people have lived here for at least the last 60 000 years during that time they have seen sea level rise by about 150 meters so the land and seascape today that is the great barrier reef was completely different during their time here in this part of the world that tens of thousands of years long enduring spiritual connection to the environment of the great barrier reef is one of the most amazing things about this land and sea country because that is so important the great barrier reef marine park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea country in the great barrier reef we work with them on managing country we have traditional owner rangers who are part of our field management program out there on the water on the land helping us to protect the great barrier reef one of the things that we work really hard on at the great barrier reef marine park authority is striking a balance between making sure that we use the best available western science but also the tens of thousands of years old traditional ecological knowledge of our traditional owners of this land and sea country those two approaches western science and traditional ecological knowledge give us the best possible over understanding of what 's happening on the great barrier reef and let us work in partnership with traditional owners to protect the great barrier reef every five years the great barrier reef marine park authority produces an outlook report this both assesses the current condition of the marine park the pressures on the marine park the effectiveness of measures to protect it and the outlook for the future based on what the outlook report says we work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the queensland government through the reef 2050 plan this plan brings together community industry and all levels of government to work collaboratively to protect the great barrier reef we also collaborate at the international scale through the international coral reef initiative which is a collaboration between most of the countries that have coral reefs to try and help each other to do the best we can to protect these precious ecosystems for people who live in townsville and north queensland there are a lot of different ways that you can get information about the great barrier reef and specifically about the marine park and what sort of rules there are about what you can do when you are in the marine park in particular please go to our website which has a huge amount of information we also post through all of the major social media channels and last but certainly not least we would encourage you to download our eye on the reef app this is available both for android and apple devices and it allows you not only to report to us information that you 've seen about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides you with information about our zoning plan and the other rules of what you can do when you 're visiting the great barrier reef,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

4810, Australia",1241,[Music] hi my name 's leonie wood i 'm a visual artist from makai how did i start making art it was probably when i was a 16 year old living in melbourne when i was allowed to have the last year of school and attend rmit i sadly didn 't stay at rmit but it led me on the path of pursuing up the rest of my life it really was decided for me because it was those early experiences at rmit where i was first introduced to life drawing and i just had an affinity for it and it 's something although my life has obviously gone through many changes i 've always pursued it wherever i 've been and wherever it 's possible and i must admit i prefer the female form but you know just life drawing in itself it 's such a beautiful thing to do but you i do feel for myself that it works best if if i have a good relationship with modeling as much as i i 'm i feel really great about how that person is sitting standing doing whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the model i 'm fairly renowned for approaching people in the street which i think particularly now i 'm this age nobody 's too worried but otherwise advertising you know i have a drawing group at home in makai which is really just a group of people about 15 people generally speaking and it 's untutored so i just provide the model and the hall and we 'll get there and draw but and i 'll advertise for the models as well you know you you just try and once you get a good model you really want to keep them but you do want variety as well to each or i have taught many times in the past i 've done a series of workshops for the regional gallery in mackay art space for the arts society um some of the things i 've probably enjoyed most have been uh during previous art festivals where it 's been a little event so we may do a day of life drawing and then because my work is not purely visual art i 've also done ceramic art working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the life drawing we provide a ceramic form and the participants are invited to try and resolve a design that they use their model on the pot in some way i was extremely lucky to be married to rickwood who is a fairly well-renowned queensland potter but over time we ended up combining our work in as much as he provided the canvas for me to work on the first ones were bits of disaster obviously because i was worried i 'd mess the pot up but it just it overtook us i did i did i constantly worked on ceramics and i really missed doing that now i did a little after he died but um you never know what opportunities come up and something actually was mentioned to me here in townsville last night so you know it might happen again in a way yes well this is the only thing i can think of apart from a dedicated space which i really don 't have at home now and harking back to the days of working with rick when we worked obviously all day long in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioning would have been great but no i don 't hanker for anything in particular except a good model i guess the only thing that comes to mind when i 'm asked what best advice have i been given um is actually a few words from townsville 's own ronald mcburney who ages ago he had been out to the gallery that my husband and i then had along with our workshops and purchased things but bumping into him many times he would always say are you still drawing you should be drawing so it 's just that it 's just keep at your work really more so about being themselves not worrying about what anyone else is doing desperately want them to free up because i want to free up the style of drawing that i do they 're usually only 20 minute drawings at the most i don 't spend time laboring over it it either works or it doesn 't so it 's really delightful to see a beginner that is starting to put a little bit of sensitivity into some lines [Music] challenges about showing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harking back once again to when myself and my husband had a gallery associated with our workshops in mackay so that 's more that relates really directly to selling your own work which is for most of us is a very difficult thing um and then on the other level of if i 'm asked to to show work somewhere place it somewhere for sale to my mind i guess my biggest challenge is to make sure that i i really give them the best work that i have so yeah i 'm super critical about what i do but i want to be really happy with what i put out there and if people don 't like it well that doesn 't matter it 's about me look honestly i think you 've got to be um you 've got to be able to you can 't be precious about it you know in in essence at times it 's a product particularly with ceramics but yes it 's beautiful when you get people that really love what you do and in retrospect i 'm i 'm always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i 've had something to do with and they love it you couldn 't ask for more than that really oh really i think it 's all about for me it 's just about honing a craft all the time you know which i still go on doing sometimes trying to not make you want the work to really more or less be seen as your signature so it has to be a true reflection of yourself just being honest i must admit this has been having an exhibition at purse tucker was something i would never have expected to happen and having been invited by lucy bell as curator here at first tucker at first i was yes and very very um embarrassed and then i thought oh no i 've got to be really grateful that this has happened to me and i am it 's a wonderful opportunity and it 's um i i 'm very happy with with the whole process particularly a lovely little um catalogue that 's been done up for me the beautiful banners outside yeah it 's it 's it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's happened to me so i 'd i it would be lovely if everybody came in and had a look at not only my work but everybody else is because there 's some really wonderful work in here you,"(-19.2589635,

4810, Australia",1774,[Music] i 'm andrea hewlen i 'm an artist in cairns far north queensland i 'm a painter i work across a few genres like still life portraits and figurative work that incorporates some urban landscapes as well which is what i 'm showing here yeah i came to my practice quite late so i was a journalist and announcer with abc radio in my early career and then moved on to work for the cairns regional gallery and some other arts institutions in cairns in marketing and communication roles and that led me to kind of want to revisit the art that i did at school and dabbled with over the years and and sort of see what i might still be able to do or not do and then it kind of snowballed from there so really i 've only been focusing on my painting for the last 10 years so this exhibition kind of came about from some earlier work i did where i kind of looked at the still life painting that i usually do and the things that attracted me to still life painting which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of sparkle in some of the objects that i paint in my still life work in oil paint and it led me to think what if i took the same approach with figures and it the boxiness of the figures in their ppe you know their hives uniforms and the uniformity of those with that little bit of reflective sparkle and that little bit of light bouncing off the helmets and that sort of thing has me thinking about them almost as objects rather than people so in a way that 's kind of how it led to them then i changed it a little bit and added changed the medium as well so it became water-based medium gouache and acrylic paint instead of oil which really was just to shift it a little bit again but also to have a bit of a break from the um smelly oil paints so yeah just to kind of sometimes it 's nice to just kind of stretch out and and do something a bit different yeah so my method for making these works is is based off photographs so um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photos that way with my smartphone but most recently i 've decided that that i would actually take a deep breath and approach the the workers and approach the work sites and the owners of the companies and asked if i could have permission to to visit and so that 's what i did this time i went to the source and took lots of photographs so i do work from the photographs but i manipulate those first so i do some digital collaging so i take figures from one image and place them in another place or i add elements and that sort of thing to to various photographs just to complete the composition or to add something in that i want to be there so i work from those digital collages i i asked someone once they were digging a hole or doing something and i said oh look i 'm an artist and i just want to get some photos of you guys at work and they 're all like oh i don 't know i don 't know so they go and get their boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes or no and i thought okay i don 't know what to do with that that 's when i realized i had to actually get permission from sort of higher higher up so i actually approached ken 's regional council and they um they granted me a kind of artist in residency at their depot so i was able to go and i had a little chaperone and i was able to to take photos and move around quite freely in my own ppe at the various sites so that was actually really good because i hit the mother lode i hit the hive of his mother alone so um yeah and that way i had i had their blessing and look the workmen they don 't mind i think um because really they 're not recognizable um i 'd say probably some of them would be able to recognize themselves but generally i think the public you know you could you wouldn 't be able to tell who 's who necessarily and in a way that 's kind of the idea that that 's that people are kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are delighted to be the subject of a painting and they say you should paint me you should paint me you know and they pose a bit and others are really shy and they don 't want to be um to be included so yeah it 's kind of interesting and but the people whose sites are in the paintings are actually really excited about having their their business oh their environment in paints no i don 't think anyone who 's ever been in them because i took those photos sneakily so and from quite a distance so i don 't think anyone really would have known that they 're in them this one 's a bit different so this one i think the the artists are all the the companies know they 're in these paintings so they said they were going to send some photos to the guys so i 'd be really curious to know what they think especially this guy you know one of this rio guy because he 's um he 's quite handsome yeah and he 's uh it 's quite i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him himself there so with my process i do sort of work on one painting at a time um especially with the coloured ones although i have my work i have all the reference material ready to go and the paper ready to go and once i 've got that all ready i tend to work on them fairly quickly one after the other after the other and then i keep the momentum going and i quite enjoy that feeling of sort of knocking one over and moving on to the next one straight away uh rather than having to fiddle around with the reference material and that sort of thing with the big black and white ones i have two big canvases stapled to the wall and i 'd tend to work on those at the same time so while one 's drying work on the other one so that was quite fun in my studio i couldn 't live without my ipad probably it 's not very you know old school but there you go i use it for my reference material i get good darks and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a print out so i use it for a paint from it i also use it as kind of visual diary so i 'll use it to to do some mock-ups sometimes playing music on it yeah it 's quite a workhorse i find it very useful in the studio it 's covered in paint but i 'd have to say probably the main thing i can 't do without is air conditioning because i 'm a princess and at scans it gets very very hot so the best piece of advice i 've been given as an artist is probably from my sister who 's also an artist in western australia and we often talk about fear and um you know the internal critic the inner creek and so on and she says she says to start a painting every painting as if it 's just a practice as if it 's just a study and then you 're not invested in the outcome and you 're not so scared about it being perfect or imperfect if it works out great and if not that 's okay you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the next thing and say oh that was good exercise yes definitely the biggest challenge of showing your artwork in public is self-doubt and and um exposing yourself to ridicule and the idea that no one would ever tell you you know you 've just got to everyone tells you nice things of course but you you don 't know what they 're really thinking so that 's okay uh look it 's much harder in the very early stages when it 's your first body of work and that was actually properly terrifying but now that i 've had some successes i 'm much more comfortable with showing a body of work and i know that you know some work is better than others some bodies of work are better than others but i 'm much more able to kind of be cool with that um yeah it 's once you get over that initial hurdle of your first couple of exhibitions i think things get a bit easier purse tucker regional gallery organised a brochure for me a catalogue for this show which is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm really excited about that and there was an essay written by a fellow artist in in that which is the closest thing i suppose to a art critique and i found that quite yeah quite thrilling actually to sort of see some what someone else has taken out of your work and how they 've made sense of it and written about it and so i found that really great i guess i 'd like to be able to thank the people who are in the paintings and the ones who are aware and those who weren 't aware but also to ken 's regional council ldi constructions and gda constructions for letting me come and visit and hang around like a bit of a weirdo with the camera so thanks for buying into it i think they probably thought what 's going on here secretly but they

use to travel and you can take it with you to a lot of different places while you have it on loan so let 's have a look at what it actually looks like on the device so currently my e-reader is turned off there 's a button at the top of the screen that you can press to turn it on let 's do that so when you get your e-reader and you 've turned it on it will come to this home screen where you can see there 's lots of different books and different collections available for you to read and access you will see that some of these are part red that will just be because the person previous to has actually opened up and started reading it but you can always go back to the beginning and read them from the start so let 's have a look we might look at the 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you want to read and it will automatically open you up to the page that was last read in the book now there 's a couple of different ways for you to click through the pages you can swipe across your screen and it will change pages or you can tap at the bottom corner and it will change the page also there are a couple of cool little additions if you hold your finger on a word for example without it will run through and give you the definition of what that word means if you need to access any of our menu bars simply click on the page and it will bring up our bars so you can see on page 3 of 598. if you want to jump through chapters you can do so by clicking the arrow bars and flip through the pages that way you can also have a look on the chapter chart on where you are and jump through chapters that

you can also annotate where you have possibly read something so you can highlight it or add a note so if it 's a particular definition or something that you wanted to refer back to a later date highlight it and add the note and you 'll be able to come back to any notes that you 've written beside it whenever you need to when you 're finished reading your book hold on the screen to get the menu bar back up and click back to home now you 're back on your home page these three little lines here that i like to call a hamburger is a menu bar so if you click on that menu bar down the very very bottom is a help section so you can access the getting started reading a book and any troubleshooting issues you may have by reading the help section and accessing it in there if you want to have

library things collection now before i jump into our sewing machine demonstration today i just want to let you know about our library of things and the different objects that you can borrow out from the library so of course you can borrow a sewing machine you can also borrow a kobo reader like you can see over my shoulder i 've also got some board games some musical instruments and some telescopes and even some robots that you can borrow as well as a couple of other different things like a home energy saver kit and some a laser distance measurer so let 's have a look at what is included in your sewing machine pack when you pick it up from the library you 'll pick up your sewing machine in this carry wheelie bag you 'll have your sewing machine of course you 'll have your foot controller and power plug it 's all in part of the one you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through in a moment and actually go one by one into what is included in it you 'll have a library of things information sheet from the library and you 'll also have a sewing machine instruction manual and user guide so let 's have a deep dive into the different components of the machine that you could may choose to use as well as what is included in our little clear box i 'm going to start with our little clear box first so in our clear box there is an overlocker foot a zipper foot a satin stitch foot a blind hem foot an auto button hole foot a quilting guide a lint brush some spare sewing machine needles um a quick unpick which is very useful for the sewers out there some spare bomber bobbins sorry and it all comes in this clear carry case which is easily labeled for you to find what you are looking for now let 's take a look at our machine and the different parts of the machine and things that you can do with it so start from number one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winder and your bobbin stopper in here is where you will put your thread that you are using when you actually go to shred your needle there is some instructions written on the machine on how to actually thread your thread through the machine and into your kneader as well but basically i 'll trace it out for you now as well so you 'll set your thread on the holder you 'll come across here around here down in the front of the machine up and around number three you need to hook into this clip here come back down you 'll hook into a little hook just above the needle and then you 'll thread into your needle and push it out the back we 've also got here obviously your foot and this is where your bobbin um will get put into the machine so you can use it over on this back side here which you may not be able to see is our foot pressure dial so if you need your foot to be heavier on the plate that 's where you can adjust that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diff or shows the different stitches and their allocated number in their settings so if you want a simple zigzag stitch you 'll change your dial to number two if you want a more complex um zigzag stitch you 'll change it to number 14. down the bottom here is your um stitch length obviously one is short and when we go through two five is um lengthier your reverse button is on the front here as well so push it down quite firmly to move your machine in reverse up here is also how tight you want your stitches as well so you will adjust that if you want it looser or tighter and on the side is where you can adjust your needle height um if you need to pivot your material or re-thread it or anything like that pop your um height adjustment out to enable you to refill a bobbin using the bobbin filler up here and this one also slides across as well i will also run through some things that we have in the library collection which may be really helpful for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some new ideas to have a look at we have these magazines available for all sorts of sewing guides there 's some behind me which has some quilting and handmade items this one is obviously clothing in fashion and in the back of these magazines they contain patterns for you to actually create the clothes that the magazine discuss which is really helpful instead of buying the patterns you can come alone at a magazine and get the pattern from the back of the magazine as always we do have other library collections like our arts and crafts section with books on quilting fashion design different handmade things for around the home that you can borrow at any time as well if you do want to borrow out our sewing machine you will need to have a library membership which is free for you

booksand talk called uh advanced and fair this chapter is called this is yarn about yarns a meriyan if you like us too will find marginal stories and grand narratives twisted together in macabre ways here as we stand in a noisy hall outside a high school science lab in front of us we see a fairly typical science display yeah i lost my place yeah fairly typical science display in a glass cabinet a series of skull models representing human evolution the skulls are colored in a sequence from most primitive to most advanced from black to brown to beige to white this same time chart sequence tone chart sequence is repeated in the evolution posters on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melon and loss until finally arriving at the pinnacle of process of progress the nordic male as we stand there us two giggling like naughty bubs of the big dirty joke in front of us a teacher approaches shaking his head he 's been unimpressed over the last two days by the professional development training we 've been delivering for school staff about aboriginal perspectives there you are he says what are you looking at that for i suppose you 're coming up with another conspiracy theory to make us all feel like racists then yes we say that 's exactly what we 're doing my second son was born while i was writing this story his name is diver after his great great grandfather who was given that name by police when he was stolen from the bush as a child and made a ward of the state he had no english name so they called him that after he attempted to escape by diving into the river his family and tribal affiliation are still unknown however this is a common ancestral story for a lot of aboriginal people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist because they 're unable to claim a tribal identity based on registered bloodlines or are unable to name these because of relatives who 've passed for white and understandably wish to keep their prosperity intact there are a lot of indigenous stories like this and if they don 't line up with the larger narratives driving policies and funding they 're often burned up and blown away along with the people who carry them one such larger narrative is that of the dying black race this drove a policy of capturing and removing aboriginal people in openly declared attempts to eradicate aboriginality by breeding out dark skin in hopes of arriving in a final solution hey well it didn 't work although the narrative has enjoyed something of a revival lately we 're still here and you can ridicule or deny or regulate or modify or limit our identities based on whatever new narratives you like but we 're not going away maybe at the start of the next century some red-headed chinese black fella will be camping on what used to be parliament house cooking up a wombat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass and my boy diver blonde as his mother 's irish dad will still be here telling our stories and passing on our culture a proud sign of two aboriginal families and a bunch of mad celts that word cyan is uh s-c-i-o-n it means like um descendant coming out from there so that 's little diver 's second name zion his third name is jummah so his namesake of the old follow keeps the forever yarns our family stories will outlast the stories of this civilization but at the moment they 're almost invisible in the shadow of monolithic grand narratives like progress the narrative of progress is grounded in the myth of primitivism the widely held assumption that life before the industrial era was brief brutish savage and simple this is contrasted with the myth of development of advanced societies and people from europe representing progress and enlightenment there must be an upward trend to show to keep the illusion alive when the masses come down with avatar depression or begin to chafe at the bleakness of their lives they 're reminded nightly on their screens of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and healthier our existences are today unpacking these narratives and retelling them from our indigenous perspectives highlights a few inconsistencies in the story and a few parts that have been left out our standpoint strips away the dogma that constrains our minds and potential allowing some room for higher order thinking that gives rise to intriguing questions for example if paleolithic lifestyles were so basic and primitive how did humans evolve with trillions of potential neural connections in the brain of which we now use only a tiny fraction what kinds of sophisticated lifestyles will be needed to evolve such a massive brain over hundreds of thousands of years what kind of nutritional abundance would be needed to develop such an organ made mostly of fat how does the narrative of harsh survival in a hostile landscape align with this fact if our prehistoric lives were so violent hard and savage how could we have evolved to have such soft skin limited strength and delicate parts the stereotypical caveman does not stand up well to this line of questioning but still he persists in our hearts and minds internalized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image in contemporary civilization that if i ask you to stop reading and picture it in your mind for a minute you will then open your eyes and see that my next sentence describes that image perfectly a broad-nosed thick brown hairy savage dressed in animal skins is standing with dull eyes and a wooden club in his hands possibly over the supine form of a woman he just knocked out to drag back to his cave for this chapter i paid homage to that western cliche by carving two wooden clubs in maya clan these are referred to as your poink or law sticks they communicate custodial claims to places and stories asserting cultural authority and even ownership of objects and resources they can be stuck into the ground to show a claim to place or objects alongside them the stories of the person carrying them may be etched or painted into the business end of the club smaller ones may also be used as message sticks to carry stories and knowledge to different groups and territories but if you dug them up in the ancient dirt at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any utility for them beyond bludgeoning the two clubs are carved from beef wood and they are floored with a number of cracks in the surface of the wood that have been filled with a black sap used as a kind of glue or putty there are cracks in the stories i 'm sharing here too the grand narratives and the cheeky counter narratives i 'm presenting to disrupt them real cheeky i yawned with a lot of different people while i carved out the ideas and stories in this chapter but nobody would engage with my critique of primitivism their eyes just glazed over and i felt like i 'd hit some kind of firewall installed through sunday morning cartoons they all engaged with my story about prussia though which surprised me because it 's probably the most lunatic incendiary rant that 's ever fallen from my lips but before we get to that we 'll continue the lonely business of tipping the sacred cows of primitivism and progress the myth of the primitive is a constant touchstone and counterpoint to the narrative of progress it is used across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words back when we were cavemen with pop science pundits using this mythology to justify everything from social media addiction to rape my favorite assertion was drawn was from a doctor who said that the first medical tool was a stick that cavemen used to poke unmoving people to see if they were dead which suggests they 're able to determine a hell of a lot of cultural information from a small pile of bones discovered around the world the sum total of which would fit in the back seat of your car true god on the bright side researchers are always happy to modify this story when new information comes to light for example when dna from the iconic neanderthal was discovered in all europeans overnight announcements changed the narrative hey we 're discovering that neanderthals were actually a lot more sophisticated than previously thought not every new discovery entered the story though when it was found that neanderthal women carried much the same suite of bone injuries as men similar to the fractured patterns of rodeo clowns there was a brief silence before the menwa hunters and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries also suggested that people cared for each other in ancient times and had fairly advanced medical practices as well as a diet rich enough to mend bones quickly there was even evidence of disabled people being cared for well into their twilight years but that doesn 't fit the dominant narrative of brutish misery and short lives with only the strongest and most psychotic individuals dominating and surviving against all odds killing everyone else and spreading their superior seed there is a reason not many ancient human bones have been discovered until very recently in human history most people had funerary practices that included sky burials this involved placing the body on a platform to be eaten by birds and animals with remaining large bones carried by mourners for a respectable period before being stored in trees or caves or logs or dunes or broken up into small pieces as part of morning rituals those big bones were usually the skull and thigh bones later in history those bones would become a symbol of heathen terrorists known as pirates still later they would be used as a symbol warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten and people are left wondering why they are not there not many bones to find and why the ones they do find are fairly miserable specimens it 's probably because those specimens belong to rogues bandits and outcasts who had nobody to care for them after death which is an interesting data set to build an entire prehistory from but still they built that narrative you 'll find no other area of science outside of pro-smoking doctors in the 1950s that has manufactured more fanciful tales from limited evidence these tales were projected onto all encounters with southern hemisphere indigenous people in an orgy of confirmation bias that manifested as weirdly diligent mass hysteria stories are powerful tools and can be even more powerful weapons in the hands of malignant narcissists if you want to take control of your life or work towards some kind of sustainable change in the world you need to harness the power of story so there 's a symbol i use to mark a way of thinking that i call story mind it 's um this one here there 's more to narrative than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the stories of others to seek greater understanding about our reality it 's a test of validity and rigger for new knowledge the symbol shows two people sitting bringing their stories together to share through sand talk to extend their knowledge false narratives do not stand up well to this kind of analysis story mind is a way of thinking that encourages dialogue about history from different perspectives as well as the raw learning power of narrative itself narrative it 's the most powerful mechanism for memory while isolated facts go only to short-term memory or mid-term memory with repetition as for studies with exams story goes immediately to long-term memory if you can make up a story or know a story it connects metaphors locations and language triggers to help you remember something you 're studying it will save time and increase your long-term recall stories are also called yarns but yarning as a verb is a different process altogether the symbol represents the yarning process as well as narrative because this is the process by which stories come together and begin to have meaning without yarning stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an exchange of stories if you want to be awake and grown yarning is more than just a a story or conversation in aboriginal culture it 's a structured cultural activity that is recognized even in research circles as a valid and rigorous methodology for knowledge production inquiry and transmission it 's a ritual that incorporates elements such as story humor gesture and mimicry for consensus building meaning making and innovation it references places and relationships and is highly contextualized in the local world views of those yarning it has protocols of active listening mutual respect and building on what others have said rather than openly contradicting them or debating their ideas there is no firm protocol of only one person speaking at a time although the mutual respect protocol ensures that interjections are in support of what the speaker is saying enriching what is being said there is no talking stick protocol the talking stick idea was appropriated by the west from native american culture so if you see anybody doing that this back and forth yarning style neutralizes the unpleasant phenomenon that occurs in many conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the rest of the group drowns in polite boredom monologues are rare in aboriginal culture unless a senior person is telling a long story or an angry person well yeah angry person is airing grievances there is a lot of overlapping speech that makes yarning vibrant and dynamic and deeply stimulating it is non-linear branching off into diverse themes and topics but often returning to revisit ideas in ways that find connections and correlations between diverse sets of data that would otherwise not be found in more analytical modes of dialogue there may be periods of comfortable and communicative silence that are reflective and not considered to be awkward the end point of yarn is a set of understandings values and directions shared by all members of the group in in a loose consensus that is inclusive of diverse points of view the primary mode of communication in yarns is narrative the sharing of anecdotes stories and experiences from the lived reality of the participants sand talk may be incorporated as people sketch images on the ground or even in the air to illustrate a point or map out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events occurring in stories sharing drink or food is often part of the ritual most commonly cups of tea today often yarning will occur around a shared material shared material cultural activity like weaving painting string making ceremony preparation and even things like crossword puzzles and setting up birthday party decorations janas will usually sit in a group so that everybody can see everybody else or in a rough circle maybe whatever shape the formation takes it has no stage or audience spaces this removes hierarchical barriers to consensus and also avoids the shame that often comes with being in the spotlight or having to speak in front of an audience some group members may have more authority and respect than others if they 're senior people but that authority is usually used to pull people back into line when they break protocol rather than to pursue ego driven agendas usually yarns and yarning can be more than tools to enhance memory and engagement they can be a disruptive innovation that is empowering and liberating when transferred to contemporary media unfortunately this potential is usually lost in the widespread indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarning circles while this kind of narrative is important it lacks the power of critical indigenous lens on the world strong indigenous voices need to be doing a bit more than just recounting our subjective experiences we also need to be examining the narratives of the occupying culture and challenging them with counter narratives this is difficult though because every time we win some small space for indigenous critical perspectives in any institution conservative pundits insist we must be promoting the history of western civilization particularly in the education system and i agree we should be examining the history of this civilization in schools very closely there is a reason ideological battles and culture wars filled with rhetoric about patriotism and nation-building are fought around schools and schooling schools are sites of political struggle in this civilization because they 're the main vehicles for establishing the grand narratives needed to make progress possible the entire history of globalization hinges on the story of modern public education how it began and why i often wonder what would change if people were able to see this story retold from the perspective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest syllabuses from prussia the answer is it would be an outlandish conspiracy theory that has no place in a glass cabinet full of skulls that 's why i 'm going to tell it here while most of the facts are verifiable i 've been very selective in which facts i used to build the narrative i created the story to illuminate the way history can be twisted to suit the interests and narratives of the people who write it but mostly are for laugh it is fun to imagine what history would look like if it were written not by the winners but by losers like me the story of modern public education then is a story of transition between an age of imperialism and an age of modern globalization it begins like all stories about civilizations with the theft of land from indigenous people the people were the prusai natives of an area between modern day germany and russia who lived there from at least 9000 bce they traded amber and hemp across europe and into asia but mostly they lived by hunting and fishing they maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south trouble had been brewing for centuries germanic and other nordic refugees refugees from previous roman invasions also from rising sea levels from starvation as a result of degraded soil caused by recent incursions of agriculture those refugees went viking across europe viking was a verb meaning raiding in those days these boat people really were a problem they had overrun britain and changed that island forever although roman and celtic invaders had already been there before them so the poor old british copped a triple dose of colonial abuse the bruse however were lucky enough to escape the worst of this colonization process for many centuries for a while at least they continued their traditional lifestyle along with many other indigenous nations to the north you might notice this has taken a while to get around to the modern education system but yeah in an aboriginal like deep time view of history you got to go back a bit this isn 't far back for us this is like five minutes ago and it all um explains a lot as you 'll see so back then there weren 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bioregions lots of regions with with all different laws languages and customs shaped by the land in that region very much like australia was before colonial occupation big countries with one law one language and one people are a very very recent invention designed to facilitate more effective control of populations and resources for economic purposes this is why after the romans had left the germanic regions the rich land owners struggling for dominance there worked hard to restore the roman system of social control they fought to reinstate this power system for a thousand years with many small states battling each other for supremacy the roman eagle standard emblazoned on their coats of arms this obsession with rome would cause some problems down the track particularly for the indigenous prusai to the north in the 13th century an organization called the order of teutonic knights and this is important the order of teutonic knights broke away from the other german regional groups and decided to create create its own new state the site the knights chose was president so they invaded and exterminated or assimilated the prusai people making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you won 't find any images of knights wiping out indigenous people what you will find instead are armored heroes white knights bravely slaughtering beasts dragons and mythical monsters these creatures came to represent the tribal cultures of the world the romantic european image of the night slaying the dragon is actually a hidden reference to the systematic genocide of what were called pagan peoples this european tradition of propaganda in which victims of genocide are portrayed as dangerous animals was later used to great effect against the jews and even our mob here in australia who up until half a century ago were often considered animals rather than human citizens by 1281 the order of teutonic knights had all but wiped out the native prusai and created the new state of prussia the interesting thing is that these white knights had been heavily involved in the crusades in which the roman church had been fighting a christian war for centuries to take over jerusalem and other holy places they failed to do so so badly that instead of bringing europe to the middle east they brought the middle east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government that had seen there and liked this system was its in its final stages of decline during the crusades in the middle east with most of the middle eastern forests and farming lands stripped bare and turned into desert by the ravages of the world 's first civilizations in the following centuries the survivors had begun returning to more sustainable ways of life tribalism subsistence agriculture and pastoralism sheep herding goat hurting camel herding a way of life that would later be turned upside down again by 20th century anglo oil interests the failed model borrowed by the teutonic knights wasn 't invented in the middle east it had its origins in an unsuccessful asian experiment of large states with total government authority and rampant expansion and production this was completely alien in europe which was used used to a system of petty warlords and oligarchs struggling chaotically over dwindling natural resources while local peasants in villages persisted much as they had since the beginning of the iron age periodically disrupted by the activities of the powerful the exotic new system introduced by the teutonic knights was all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will control the daily lives of all remember too that these new prussians had just spent a thousand years trying to replicate the system of control that they had experienced under the romans who had originally conquered germania britain and the us later mastered rome 's imperial method a system of establishing indigenous elites to keep conquered peoples in check promoting lateral violence and competition to make subjugated people self-policing vassals prussia even adopted the roman symbol of the eagle as a logo which was later picked up by the united states and the nazis rome introduced mesmerizing dreams of power and control that have not been easy to shake even in modern history by the 18th century prussia under frederick the great had become one of the greatest powers in europe despite its small size and lack of natural resources this was due to the fact that it had a larger permanent military force than anyone else no other country could force so many of its citizens into the army full time the prussian system was one of total control which successfully managed to coerce the population into complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing army was not a problem for them over a century later the u.s military would adopt their formula for maintaining permanent standing armies on the advice of a prussian military cons consultant named friedrich wilhelm von steuben prussia didn 't stop there the more rights it stripped from prussian citizens the more powerful it became frederick the great 's nephew continued this process depriving every adult of all rights and privileges then in 1806 the prussians suffered a shattering military defeat at the hands of napoleon after their after their beaten soldiers fled from certain death the prussians decided to turn their attention to the children here 's where it began they realized they had to start young if they wanted to instill the kind of obedience that would override the fear of death itself the government decided that if it could force people to remain children for a few extra years that it could social emotional and intellectual development and control them more easily this was the point in history when adolescence was invented a method of slowing the transition from childhood to adulthood so that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in indigenous rites of passage from childhood to adulthood this delayed transition intended to create a permanent state of childlike compliance in adults was developed from farming techniques used to break horses and to domesticate animals bear in mind that the original domestication of animals involved the mutation of wild species into an infantilized form with a much smaller brain and an inability to adapt or solve problems to domesticate an animal in this way you must do three things one separate the young from their parents in the daylight hours two confine them in an enclosed space with limited stimulation or access to natural habitat 3. use rewards and punishments to force them to comply with purposeless tasks effectively the prussians created a system using the same techniques to manufacture adolescents and thus domesticate their people the system they invented in the early 19th century to administer this change was public education the radical innovation of universal public schooling followed by streaming into trade professional and leadership education it was all arbitrated by a rigorous examination system on top of the usual considerations of money and class the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcker school where they learned simple versions of history religion manners and obedience and were drilled endlessly in basic literacy and numeracy tasks discipline was paramount boredom was weaponized and deployed to lobotomize the population this system worked so well that prussia became one of the most powerful countries in the world at a time when the idea of nations rather than regions kingdoms tribes or city-states was first being promoted as the dominant form of social organization on the planet the prussians began to make plans to spread the institution of schooling as a tool for social control throughout the world as it facilitated the kind of uniformity and compliance that was needed to make the model of nationhood work the us could testify to the effectiveness of prussian education as a tool for domination and power as american educators had been making pilgrimages to germany for more than half a century excitingly test schools across america proved that the artificially induced phenomenon of adolescents was achievable outside of prussia and germany too in 1870 prussia got its revenge on france by annihilating the french military in the franco-prussian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of the teutonic knights finally realized after that the prussian education system and the new institution of extended childhood became all the way all the rage around the western world it was modified to some extent probably because the prussian model seemed a bit weird even to the power hungry ultra rich of europe it was so all-encompassing that women were required to register each month with the police when their menstruation started prussia was described jokingly as an army with a country or a gigantic penal institution towns and cities were built like prison blocks grey grids of rigid cubes and plane surfaces the government worked hard to cleanse the society of homeless people gypsies jews and homosexuals as they expanded and enforced their embryonic doctrine of eugenics their motto for education was i think how you say that which means work sets you free this was a slogan that the nazis adopted and later placed above the gates of concentration camps including auschwitz used for jewish slave labor and extermination there are many schools in australia today with a similar motto in latin uh labor omnia vincent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workforce to serve the national economy is the openly stated goal of public education and as ever the inmates of this system are told that their enthusiastic compliance with forced labor will be in their best interests at some future point germany 's compulsory education system expressed six outcomes in its original syllabus documents one obedient soldiers to the army two obedient workers for mines factories and farms three well-subordinated civil servants four well-subordinated clerks for industry five citizens who thought to like on most issues six national uniformity in work in word thought and deed and it spread like wildfire to hungary in 1868 austria in 1869 switzerland in 1874. italy in 1877 holland in 1878 belgium in 1879 britain in 1880 in france in 1882 from there it quickly expanded further to european colonies including australia as we 've seen the u.s had been involved much earlier with even benjamin franklin advocating the prussian system in 1913 woodrow wilson established the federal reserve copying germany 's centralized banking system too this way the state would control both learning and money just like germany did as the 20th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us both drawing on the symbols and dreamings of ancient rome because germany 's old obsession with ancient rome hadn 't gone away they called their leader kaiser german for caesar they adopted the symbol of the roman fascists which are bundles of rods with an axe that once represented roman state power the us followed suit american education documents emerged with those same symbols of the fascist printed on the covers and today the fascias are still a prominent symbol of american power proudly on display in many official ceremonies the roman fascists came to represent a whole modern belief system around social control and national domination that 's where fascism got its name from and a version of the roman salute was famously adopted by the nazis in that period when hitler was times man of the year in america three times i think the pseudoscience of eugenics that the nazis so enthusiastically adopted was popular throughout the western world it was big it purported to legitimate a decades-old tradition of white supremacy that had earlier informed the nationalist values established during australia 's federation and exemplified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alfred deakin which is the name of the university where i work now but that 's all right i got my i got my doctorate from um james cook university so we 're just one big happy family anyway not just in australia but all around the world new systems of education nationalism finance corporatism and social control were informed by fascist ideas and theories from germany and the united st followed as new nations that had missed out on the empire building activities of the age of discovery tried to catch up with their land rich neighbors when the smoke cleared lands and power and blame were redistributed unevenly amongst the survivors and a new world emerged with new stories providing a sanitized history of good triumphing over evil in italy for example it used to be common knowledge but now all but forgotten that hitler 's fascist partnering crime mussolini exterminated the cavern equally a cave-dwelling people who were still maintaining a paleolithic culture he called them la verganya d 'italia the shame of italy so the structural racism installed through prussian-style schooling and the eugenics movement would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles and campaigns for social justice racial inferiority was named renamed cultural difference racial integration was called reconciliation in the colonies assimilation was relaunched as closing the gap the language became more politically correct but the globalizing goals of cultural uniformity economic compliance and homogenized languages and identities remain the same in my crackpot version of this history and it is crackpot public schooling plays a principal role in the story of transition from one age to the next it 's by no means a complete account but i hope this marginal perspective is enough out of the box to provoke some questions regarding the sustainability of the global systems that shape our minds and our lives and our young people where is our current turbulent period of transition taking us do we want to go there what formal knowledge transmission aka education need to take during this transition us to may also tentatively wonder whether our minds are now too domesticated and shriveled even to contemplate these questions effectively a good way to begin might be to listen to as many divergent versions of this history as possible from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from feminist versions of this story but also from libertarians and poets and neo-conservative professors and the alt-right and the incarcerated most important i will learn from yarns with children the inmates of the education system suddenly i think of us two standing back there at the high school science lab laughing at the glass cabinet with all those evolution models and i wonder what kind of stories we will share and seek together from now on the teacher 's coming there you are he says what are you looking that for i suppose you 're coming up with another conspiracy theory to make us all feel like racists then not at all says us too we 're just admiring your lovely skulls tell us the story of how they came to be and that 's the chapter who knows where we are in this global history right now i think i know where we are in the history of this civilization because it follows the same pattern as all the other civilizations that came before it um i think right now if you line us up alongside rome we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caligula and nero

carvings uh that i did for the for the book sand talk so um yeah if you read that book you 'll see that for every chapter i i carved that indigenous knowledge first into an object a lot of a lot of knowledge from a lot of big yarns with old people from all over and you know um this is how our culture works these are our texts you know we have these visual things we have dances we have song story we have yarns and all of our cultural practice is knowledge work it 's a way of storing all that memory all that knowledge in objects images memory deep memory and so all these all these objects i wanted to keep my thinking straight i wanted to keep it in our way first i wanted to make sure my thinking wasn 't uh you know polluted by print because print makes a mess of things so i made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a few more there there 's a few that aren 't here because you know these are things that you know usually a big part of making them is about where they 're going to go in our traditional economy you know who they 're going to go to in the community and what they 're going to be used for you know so a lot of the objects for the chapters you know they 've gone out to uh different people at different times um you know people who are keeping that knowledge that 's there how you doing and it 's a lot more than just what 's written um the knowledge in the objects themselves there 's just you know there 's like two books in each of those things so each chapter is really it 's a translation you know of a fragment of the knowledge it 's not all the knowledge what you 're going to see written down in print there um you know print is uh print is a problem and i guess that 's mostly uh what i want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book in this way some of the things i did to try and uh protect the knowledge and keep it keep it in the right way you know because there 's a lot of there 's a lot of problems with print for a start literacy i know how important it is um which is why i 've done so much work to to get my own literacy up and um you know make sure i 'm fluent and and you know really good at writing but all that ever is if we 're talking about our knowledge is just a rough translation of a fragment because our languages you know english and aboriginal languages they don 't really line up too well there 's a lot of words we have in our languages that just um there 's no translation in english and there 's a lot of english words where there 's just no translation in aboriginal languages so the language that i 've been working in from my extended family in western cape york there uh wickmonken um it it doesn 't have any abstract nouns you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society you know things like this so you can imagine um the difficulties there um and you know the way we deal with and express all these abstract concepts you know is is through different modalities different ways of representing knowledge and so yes that 's in song it 's in story it 's in dance it 's in uh body paint it 's in paintings it 's in um and of course you know drawings uh even just on the ground which is something that traditionally uh has been practiced nor all over australia by um you know many or most of our our um our first peoples in australia um i was really influenced too with the idea of sand talk you know by the those practices in in the central desert but also um gamilaroi in western new south wales those mobs around there um they have a thing called a dumbay which is a stick that 's specifically for doing that sand talk and drawing in the ground and it was used so much that everybody would carry a dumbay around with them all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get ideas across you know about you know land and story and abstract concepts um a lot of it is mapping as well but then everything is a map you know a story is a map um the land itself is a map um all of your memory and ideas and knowledge is a map so for me it was important to map these things first so you know a lot of uh drawing these a lot of symbols a lot of the symbols used in the book is from a lara kia mob um old man juma up um south of darwin there um yeah it was a lot of his uh big symbols that he talks up as a big story big dreaming that goes all over and is for all people um a lot of the san talk stuff a lot of it is sort of secret and it 's only for you know women 's business or men 's business or old people business or different ceremony um that kind of thing and that 's um that 's not to be shared at all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you know if you 're doing a basic idea there 's still that protocol of you have to wipe that away off the sand um first you know i remember about um i think it was about it was about 2009 or i think or 2008 would have been 2008 i was doing some of that and i didn 't uh wipe it away straight away and i did get growled for that because i 'd left it there you know and um i mean and i was just trying to show an image of um different economic systems you know so i was trying to show the shape of the western uh more modern sort of liberal global economic system and then the shape of traditional economic systems um you know so it wasn 't like traditional ceremonial business or anything like that but still like a group for leaving that there for too long um after we 'd finished you know i i did sweep it away but you got to do it fast so there 's protocols um you know associated with all these sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important thing about indigenous thinking is is context you know we have um very strongly all of our thoughts are situated in a context a big context of land and people and relations and politics and everything all at once and mostly that uh that context is shared among us and a lot of it doesn 't have to be spoken you know but it 's referenced and situated really intensely in that so everything that we look at we 're looking at you know what they call holistically um we 're we 're viewing these things um through like a lens of complexity you know um and i often get that across by with this way you know that open hand representing our knowledge as the lens of complexity through which we 're viewing the world like that um you know through that cultural lens but then the other way the book way would be this one you know like that book sign symbol there holding your hand like you 're reading a book um i think in a lot of sign language that 's that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all indigenous knowledge um is presented in books in this way that it 's viewing the culture through that lens of the book so you know that 's all you 're seeing you 're just seeing the edges of the fingers you know you can 't see it because it 's through that um that lens of print and english and um a very different way of looking at the world that 's reductionist that 's just looking at one thing at a time you know it 's not seeing the entire context so for me the book was about turning that around and viewing the world and global knowledge through that lens like that so it 's just this turn around so that for me that 's the gesture that represents that and that 's another way we we communicate a lot of abstract knowledge is through non-verbal signals a lot of our communication is like that so they call aboriginal cultures um oral cultures a lot but i think that 's misnamed because that suggests that most of our knowledge is conveyed through words and it really isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyed through you know nonverbal things it 's conveyed through a shared context it 's conveyed through images you know movement all kinds of things but then of course these gestures it 's really important and in fact traditionally we 've got quite a we 're fairly economical with our words and there 's that of course you must have heard a thousand times um you know black fellas saying ah talk to me white fellas talk too much you know um yeah so there 's that idea there 's not that sort of verbal diarrhea so to call our language oral it 's not quite enough you know what it is is more of just a non-print based culture you know so there 's uh print based knowledge and then you know so of course because the print-based culture area that 's the dominant culture it 's going to name everything and describe everything in the world in relation to that and so it 's going to call our culture that 's not using print in the same way it 's going to refer to that as oral but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was important to work with all the knowledge in the right way first and in our way so that i was seeing the world through that that very complex um way of of aboriginal thinking um you know uh the kinship and and seeing the pattern of things and the story but not just one story but all the stories that big aggregate you know combinatorials of stories and all those stories interacting together because that 's only there where you can find that truth you know and getting yourself into the right frame of mind to see that um you know which they refer to in science or as an alpha wave state lots of different terms they have for it but you need to get yourself out of that i know they call it mindfulness a lot of that but it 's kind of a very sort of deep timeless uh state of being and thinking you know um or you 're able to do so much more with your mind you have like an intense focus but at the same time that focus is going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that state of mind you know our ancestors spent most of their lives in that state of mind and when i say our ancestors i mean all of us not just black fellas everybody you know until very recently in human history you know we were all thinking like this that 's how humans developed such a massive brain was you know through this kind of very big very deep very complex thought you know it didn 't evolve that by just sort of wandering aimlessly um around the world you know killing mammoths or whatever um that idea of the cave man is is a projection coming from this print-based culture that assumes a model of progress so there are some problems with print i mean one of them is just that it it rewires your brain to become literate is to rewire your brain in ways that are really inefficient and you 'll find this in the neural science backs this up that the processes that occur in your in your brain you know to be able to read something and write something it 's a very inefficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural way your brain needs to work and it 's a bit of a killer of complex thinking if you 're just stuck in that so you need to express your ideas in a lot of different ways first and preferably with a lot of different people before you start putting pen to paper or reading up widely about the knowledge that 's a good thing to do but i just don 't think it should be the first thing you do if you want to keep your thinking um sharp if you want to keep your thinking you know capable of seeing complexity and finding complex solutions to complex problems and arguably we 've got a couple of complex problems in the world right now so it 's worth having a bit of a dance with that kind of thinking now there 's uh there 's a lot of problems with it so so writing was invented not very long ago um you know it came out of it came of the out of the middle east um region there um yeah this uh tradition of writing and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these first civilizations you know coming out of that place there and the idea of a civilization is that it 's a community that needs to be constantly growing or it 'll collapse and in order to constantly be growing increasing then it needs to be importing resources because you can 't grow enough on your land base to have a population a community an economy that is continuously growing so you have to be going out and invading and stealing the lands of other people because your own your own land turns into desert really quickly if you 're being that extractive uh which is why you see today you know when you read the bible these places were all forest and really good pasture you know very green places in the bible um now you you go there and look and it 's all desert you know where these original civilizations were and writing was a part of that and it was about control because they needed to control they seized control of the present they had to change time so they seized control of the present moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to control people 's understanding of the past of how they got here and tell them that the way people were living before was terrible and horrible so they had these uh so they used writing to um to rewrite the history so people weren 't telling the old stories anymore all they could do was read or have read to them the new idea of the stories of the past and that helped them to control the present so there was this idea that this idea of progress was born the idea that tomorrow can always be better than today you know so they got all these people into these civilizations and the civilizations are not very nice for people to live in for most people they 're really great for the people at the top who are building the civilization but they 're not very nice for everybody else so you have to keep reassuring people that tomorrow is going to be better than today and but also it 's really important to let them know that today is a hell of a lot better than what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around naked and cold and it was horrible and and everybody was dying and killing each other and you need this rule of law and you need this economy and you need money and you need to be working your cheeks off for the rest of your life and there 'll be a reward later like down the track either after you die you 'll go to heaven or you know in the future yeah tomorrow is going to keep getting we got to keep working hard and and we 'll have this progress what went before was primitive where we are now is progress so it forced time into a line in order to complete that line you also needed to be able to control the future so the past was controlled by written histories the present was controlled by um records keeping records of everything that happened but particularly every transaction that was made so this started in you know way back like samaria and all those sort of places and they um started keeping all detailed fi records of financial transactions that way you could control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put other things out and you could control those transactions in a way that you could um create these monopolies so that the powerful were able to secure most of the good things that came out of the civilization for themselves and distribute that among a sort of a middle class and a you know whole heap of middle management sort of people who would keep everyone else under control but then they found that wasn 't enough either so the people at the bottom of the pyramid most of the people in the society they had to be able to give them somebody else to boss over so that they would sort of more readily accept the idea of having a boss over them and the idea that they might be able to climb that ladder and become the big boss themselves one day so they gave women to men to boss boss around they go all right well men you 're now the boss of all these women and so you know even the poorest person in that society it was like well if i 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't boss over her you know um and of course all of these civilizations depended heavily on slave labor so you 'd find that most of the population and it was slaves in the end and that i guess they that was where the bucks stopped they couldn 't be boss for anybody so you know you 'd threaten them with crucifixion or whatever every now and then you 'd kill one of them in a horrible way just to remind the others and keep but it 's hard to police people like that it 's hard to it 's a lot of energy to keep policing these slaves so what you do is you get them to police each other you give them rewards for gobbing each other in uh you get them to do a bit of lateral violence to each other and so instead of looking upwards to their oppressors they 're looking side to side so anyway that 's how you control the present and largely through that print and you also then you attempt to control the future with print and that 's done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah so that people have to sign these agreements and if they break the agreement then they 're breaking the law uh you have uh financial contracts legal contracts all these sorts of things where you can guarantee that somebody will have to do something in the future so you control past present future and then suddenly you change what time is you make time run in a straight line and you get this arrow of time so effectively print changed not only the way people organized themselves or govern themselves but it also changed the way of thinking it changed the way of thinking to be you know focused on just reductive little points just we 're looking at this thing we 're looking at this thing and they 're not seeing the big context because the powerful don 't want people to see the big context because people would go what this is all wrong we 're not doing that this weed all working our cheeks off and it 's just all going to use stuff that i 'm going home um so yeah you don 't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very narrow focus of reality and they knocked people out of the big uh cycles of time and the big complex you know eternity of time that everybody has lived in through most of human history and they put them all on this line so you 're only ever focusing on one point of it and it messes with the way you think so for me to go well how can indigenous thinking come up with some useful ideas about the world i couldn 't be on that arrow of time you know and i couldn 't be just focusing on one problem at a time or one aspect of one problem i needed to see the entire picture so i had to have that pattern thinking pattern logic that complex logic that 's afforded to us through our cultural practice and most importantly through our relations our relationships with people and with land and place and all these things and arguably it 's it 's the one part of our culture that that hasn 't been um eradicated so you could be the most disconnected person and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leg or or you know do anything like that you don 't have the paint and the feathers you don 't have all of that you 're not going hunting you 're in a business suit but still still you have that you still inherit that that way of thinking and you know you might be using different things that would be completely unfamiliar to people from even 100 years ago but you 're still working with those things in the same way you start to lose that though if if you 're if you lose yourself in print i 'm not saying don 't learn to read and write and don 't master those codes yeah do that but you do the other things first you know so you see artie when she 's at the shops and she 's got to try and figure out how to make you know 150 stretch to feeding 12 people for a week um she doesn 't have a shopping list with her and if she does she doesn 't look at that until the end you know she 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different way in in in that supermarket and you watch her she 'll be going around all over the place she 's not just following the aisles down she 's not going down those lines she 's she 's whipping around like a honeybee all over the place because she 's thinking about you know how she 's gonna do all these meals for all these people um it 's the same way and she 'll do the print thinking last you know um so it 's good to do do your own way first and so that 's the way um i worked uh with uh writing this book this sand talk um it was everything was situated in places and yarns and and drawing things on the ground you know a thousand of these things and then carving all of that into those objects sitting for a very long time not using any machine tools but just chipping chipping chipping chipping away at those boomerangs shields coulomb ons stone axe everything for a very long time so it was about 20 years of lots of big yarns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of talking to people from all around the world but then it was um about two years of carving the objects and it 's funny um the writing part is easy after that if you already have the knowledge and you 're not trying to think and write at the same time if you 're just typing it out then the book takes just as long as it takes you to type those words so for me writing the book writing up the actual book only took two weeks that was the easy part because i just had to type type it all out um it wouldn 't have even taken that long it would have taken a few days except i had to decide what to share and what not to share and that 's the trickiest thing you know because there 's a lot of knowledge in there that um is not for just anybody you know a lot of it 's specific for age and gender and uh different mobs you know specific to their own special places and they want to keep that to themselves yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what your what can be shared a lot of things just can 't be translated into english print so you 've got to um you 've got to work very hard at that so i tried to find a lot of ways i even had to invent a few new words so i decided in order to make a relationship with the um with the reader you know to make uh some kind of feeling of a kin connection with them like a kinship pear almost um that the english didn 't work for that you know so i i um i thought well you know we have those pronouns in aboriginal languages that have different kinds of i you me them all that kind of thing that just don 't exist in english so i wrote a lot of the book in this um it 's us two the two of us us both flour us two so i yeah so i kind of just i invented that word in english because it doesn 't exist in english so i just made one up and uh well that lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us so you know um i tried to bring that reader in in that way and that way i 'm kind of sitting with the reader talking to the reader the problem with that was the expectation for this book was that it would only sell maybe a thousand copies or something that 'll be a very small thing and that 'll be able to manage those relationships uh but instead it 's really taken off so there 's like you know tens of thousands of people reading this book and and now it 's in the united states and god knows how many people are going to read it there um so i 'm struggling a bit to manage all these relationships apart from that it 's doing all right you,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

down there i live in townsville now yeah been here for 25 years mainly because of my wife catherine i suppose she was doing a tafe course doing ceramics and painting and what have you so i i 've always liked ceramics i was even bored a bit over the years and so i thought i 'd give it a go too so i did a few lessons on the wheel and that didn 't work out real well actually because it turned out i had a heart problem so that it was a bit hard anyway so i took to um hand building and i yeah i can sort of cope with that yeah i think because you 've got to stay focused all the time too and you can 't just let it go and sit back and relax and look at it because it 'll just that doesn 't work so that 's when i decided to try um hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really enjoy that because you can take a rest if you want yeah i do like wood-fired pottery i have to admit i like anyone that makes um well i guess something that 's fairly organic i i don 't uh i 'm not into really fancy design or anything like that i like it but it 's not something i could possibly even do so something fairly simple yeah and a bit wobbly usually i really like the shape it came out really well i was very happy with it i thought i thought it was good enough to put forward yeah i didn 't expect to win anything with it i have to admit that was the last thing on my mind but anyway i i 'm happy with it we 're probably all up i 'm not sure but it 'll probably be a couple of months from the time you start making it probably two days three days maybe on and off and then it 's got to dry then for at least a week but probably in this case probably about a month uh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired at what they call a bisque firing and then um put some glaze on it and put it in to fire it again and uh it would have went well we set it at 1280 degrees centigrade but our kiln always fires a bit hotter so it knocks over cone 10 which is at 1300 degrees centigrade so it 's definitely stoneware well i don 't have a studio as such i do work just in the backyard i 've got a table out in the backyard under a big bottle tree so that 's where i do most of my work and as far as things i can 't do without well i don 't know for sure i think it 's just the peace and quiet sometimes that i really like birds coming in and things like that we have a lot of birds in our yard and things like that so that does help you relax a lot and yeah so that 's something i probably couldn 't do with that yeah that 's probably why i do enjoy it always i guess just try your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been instilled in me yeah you 've got to make it for yourself that 's the way i feel don 't make it for somebody else and if you make it for yourself and you 're happy with it that 's good enough that 's the way i look at it anyway because the moment i start thinking well i 've got to make something that looks like somebody that something that somebody might like because it 's got to be that style that doesn 't work yeah when it comes to this sort of thing for me anyway it 's got you forget about exhibitions and things like you 're making it just for yourself yeah i get a lot of positive feedback uh if i do get criticism and i haven 't heard it directly to my face i suppose i don 't know but i do have had a lot of positive from different people people that have brought my work and things like that and i just hope they 're happy they must be happy they buy it so and i i guess that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's good enough to put it in their home probably not long after i started which was about 2012 and i saw my first piece here actually the purse tucker that um actually it was a little bars and actually one of the uh young girls that worked there she bought it i don 't remember her name but uh yeah i remember i came in one day and i said oh you 've sold it and i said uh who bought it and they said oh one of the staff and they did name i think i don 't know i don 't think she 's here any

Australia",1153,[Music] hi my name is sandra black and i 'm a ceramic artist from fremantle in western australia my practice has been underway for over 45 years and i specialise in working mainly in fine porcelain both thrown and cast decorative and functional i was honoured to be asked to judge the awards this year and was looking forward to being there at the opening and meeting my fellow ceramic artists i 've been fortunate over the years to be a recipient of many of these awards myself and know how validating this can be for both emerging and establishing artists these awards are a great way of bringing ceramic works from all parts of australia and internationally into one venue for the people of townsville to enjoy having previously visited townsville i was hoping to enjoy some queensland hospitality but sadly this was not to be the case due to the onset of covet 19 and the subsequent shutting down of all our state borders the selection of the wards was difficult as there were so many fine pieces represented in this year 's collection by artists some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so i 've spent considerable hours and days considering each and every work there was also difficulty inherent in judging the work online as there are a number of pieces where the photography hadn 't done justice to the artist 's works obviously this hadn 't been anticipated due to the sudden changes in our circumstances and border closures it was frustrating to myself not to be able to be physically present with the works and assess their various qualities close up as a judge there were certain aspects i was focusing on the first was the craftsmanship to demonstrate an understanding of form in both vessels and sculptural works technical excellence in finnish surfaces a stretching and unusual exploration of the medium and a strong concept behind each work i also wanted the pieces to challenge me and make me ask why certain works evoke strong feelings drew down memories and kept haunting me and drawing me back to them so to the world starting with the smaller but no less important ones their first award the rainford family acquisitive ward was given to cecily willis from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a delightful pair of companionable vessels that snuggled up beautifully together in warm companionship referencing the body in her works she showed a sensitive application of complementary copper-based glazes against the warmth of her beautiful terracotta clay surfaces these were in horizontal and vertical stripes hence the humorous reference to striped pajamas the second award was the emu sports acquisitive award and this i awarded to warren ogden for his piece monolith this was a quietly powerful and well resolved form sensitively made and evocative of our coastal landscapes with granitic outcrops of rock it was appropriately glazed with a glaze that created a sun warm surface slightly pitted evoking beautifully the tactile qualities of the rock the third award was the loloma jewelers acquisitive award and i awarded this to annette bookavinsky for her piece called fall and its work can initially seduce us with her clever application of delicate leaves over the forms she makes it could seduce us into thinking of the axe as the supplier of timber to make our home and furniture to cut firewood and cook our food and warm our living spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speaks more of the ways we have thoughtlessly used these tools leading to serious environmental damage and global warming this ultimately leading to what we experienced this last summer with the most devastating bushfires in our history and its work like so many of her contemporaries speaks powerfully of this environmental concern she showed also great technical skill in her handling of an often difficult and contrary material in porcelain she also showed her use of non-traditional materials in the coloration of the forms evoking the darkness and devastation of the damage left behind by the fires the fourth award was the pack and scent acquisitive award which i awarded to molly bosworth for her piece called it 's not dark yet molly 's work speaks deeply from her sense of place in the far north queensland rainforest many years ago i was fortunate to spend time in a residency in port douglas and travel into that daintree rainforest i found her works suggested strongly memories of the rainforest at that twilight hour with the shimmering of moonlight on the surface of leaves and the hovering moths molly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more importantly her work has constantly spoken of the fragility of that special environment she has a beautiful mastery of form and clever application of decorative elements which speak the quiet beauty of her surrounds she is constantly experimenting and pushing into new innovative techniques to embellish her surfaces finally the most important award which was the city of townsville arts collection award this i gave to the artist mahala hill her work called armoured mist frog speaks of the loss of the small animals i have awarded this major prize to mahala hill for her work as i found it an extraordinarily compelling work with post-apocalyptic overtones it 's a savage and haunting work made with exquisite skill and a powerful message the juxtaposition of the delicate modelling of the skeletal frog remains in fine porcelain against the boiled dark blue crater glaze was stunning it is a compelling reminder of the environmental loss of the smaller but infinitely valuable species of arthropods and amphibians it was a work that resonated powerfully for me and serves as timely warning for our beautiful and fragile and often unseen underappreciated small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy task to select these awards from so many beautiful challenging and inspiring entries i wish to congratulate all the artists who took the time and energy to contribute to a beautiful display of works that will inspire and delight the people and artists of townsville i hope many of these works will find new homes there in queensland to bring joy and delight to their new owners in conclusion i wish to thank the staff of the purse tucker regional gallery for their hard work in documenting all these works to enable me to judge a very special thank you to lucy bell to sorrio who helped guide me through this somewhat challenging journey of online judging and answering the many queries i had to the people of townsville and surrounds enjoy this wonderful regional gallery as it celebrates in these trying times wonderful artists of our country thank you [Music] you,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

she decks calls a purse pulling out her rollies and getting a pre-prepared one that she dips into the ambers till she makes a nice cherry on it she takes one deep drag puffing smoke into the flames

the best stories my old dad knew a lot of things nan 's nan 's gaze is lost in the fire and her memories couldn 't teach us much not language for sure that odd protector fella wouldn 't taken us but

Australia",1260,[Music] hi today we 're going to have some fun with English and here I have some homemade ink recipes first one is India red ink and it makes this really lovely reddish brick red color and all of this is turmeric mix was started bicarbonate boiling water and a few drops of glare which I 'll show you next how to make then we have coffee ink which makes this very nice yellow brown color it 's coffee mix with boiling water and glare and then we have black ink which is basically crushed charcoal mixed with a few drops of water and glare so I 'll put this image up shortly so you can drop down the recipes now how to show you make clear and what you do is you beat up egg whites till they 're stiff and then you put it in a container and live in the fridge overnight and in the next morning you 'll see that there 's this liquid so you drain the liquid off and throw away the old egg white you can also use egg yolks as a binder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um it makes for a very stiffer ink so if you want a more fluidity this glare is the best to make how much to put in here 's an example of the charcoal paint without the glare and you can see how easily it smudges doesn 't hold the paint rez here here we 've actually got Blair in it and you can see doesn 't smudge at all she make a bamboo pen all you 've got to do is use a razor blade and with your thumb behind you push like this to carve out a shape and then you carve down the side on either side to bring it to a point is you want it quite thin or depending on what kind of marks you want to make next is you drill a hole which will be a reservoir that will hold the ink and then you cut a slip very carefully and maybe wear gloves some are thick cloth on your hands too itself and just cut a slip to that hole also you can make pets out of plastic and this one what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink bottle quite a thin strip but he needs to be a little under two centimeters what you do is you with gloved hands you hold that over an element on low heat and you 'll see that it will curl like this example here and an expert that makes it very strong stiff piece of plastic and from this point you cut a length maybe about three centimeters long once again you cut the shape the point drill a hole and then cut a slit and this makes for a beautiful flexible nib and very cheek to which is very handy to show you a few techniques with ink start with the bare boot all in with the wedge can make some interesting max you can make straight kind of Max because of the wedge shape you can put on its side and make nice little linear patterns and crosshatch with it in other end make a nice fine line then we 've got this plastic nib that we made that 's beautiful for making lovely variety in line like that next we have paintbrushes and obviously it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ink is it 's just pigments have been suspended in water and I 'll see the more concentrated the pigment the darker it is get some lovely blooming effects like this which can work really well with some linear work as well Chinese brushes are excellent for ink painting they hold a lot of ink even they come to a fine point and it 's just a very nice brush to use also we have other tools like it 's a rag rolled up that woods just Chuck 's cloth rolled up tape and this one I 've got Chuck 's cloth in a bundle inside this and it 's good for doing a dry brush technique so I 'll show you that so first it makes quite a lot of time if you keep on drying off with it all you can get some very soft max like this building up a shade they also have this stamping tool it 's basically some cord cloth that has a linear pattern in it and it creates a nice little print effect on the paper I 'll just show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great for say imitating clothing that has a bit of texture in it or you can use it for making tone on objects also we have a embossing tool which you can use to indent lines on a page if you run say like a dry brush over it your highlight the embossed area see you there see that could be good for specially for things like hair or for clothing they can make it really interesting effect also we have a toothbrush which is great for splattering try and get most of the liquid off you just use your finger make a splatter effect like that so here I 've got a few examples of my work to show you two techniques I 've used I 've used that 's them to make the patterning for tone on the face under this I 've got a wash of ink and then just a bit of using a bamboo pen to make the marks around the face here is a mixture of coffee in various tones first I did a wash in the coffee with a brush with a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my plastic nib to put all the detail in the face the closer look and then down here I 've used the plastic nib to pull the refine detail and I just did a basically lots of very linear work then with a bit of a wash yeah I 've mixed on a mixture of mixed media I 've got a lead pencil as shading underneath think I 've used a brush in some areas for older strokes and then I 've used the plastic nib to put the detail in and then I washed in the background here was just basically a mixture a very diluted to full strength and then working from diluted first and then building up the tone with stronger people turned to ink this one was a wash with a drawing in ink begin with using just ink washes very lightly and then I came in with watercolor on top of that and then finally with this with very gestural marks with the ink just quickly loose marks as you can see there

so let us know what you 're thinking in the comments below we also have a range of Star Wars items within our collection so ebooks and we have a lot of graphic novels through our be digital as well and as you can see here we 've got a few books available or than junior fiction young adult and adult fiction as well so jump onto our catalogue and have a look there might be something cool and new there that you want to read in the Star Wars universe otherwise let 's get started yeah okay so Sam what is your favorite era of Star Wars originals prequels sequels I am an OG fan I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things that are better about the original trilogy now that we have the context of the prequels yeah and not so much of people things like wait like there 's so much more significant to like the the large homestead yeah and the significance of obi-wan and Anakin is relationship I feel like like when you see them meet again in in a new hope it 's just imbued with so much meaning now yeah yeah I like that I think like when I first watched a new horrible sight mmm this old man called everyone Kenobi like he just is random well in it and like had no connection to it which five times I like I loved the original box as crap as the prequels ah I think I like there I like them all only because I 'm a sucker for like prequels my love like that type of stuff in I think in McGregor as everyone can I think really the gem of the prequel trilogy shining stuff the reason that this three of them I believe um like he he gives me that meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can maybe in the prequels and then it 's set and then that sets up their originals for me as well and yeah but the originals have something about them that means the simplicity I think especially with a new hope it 's so stripped back and because we have never seen this world before only own George Lucas himself has said that it was just meant to be like a fairy tale in space it 's like a farm boy and a wizard and bad wizard and a princess and it 's it is a fairy tale but the complexity is in the universe is created around that the story itself is so simple and we get moments of sort of quietness with Luke like him looking over the binary sunset which has they 've attempted to replicate so many times but never captured never captured that vibe again but they 're not in a rush to get anywhere it 's the story itself is simple enough that you have quiet moments with the characters of emotion yeah which I feel like hasn 't happened since it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's were just like being blasted out of a cannon like there was no quiet moments at all anywhere and that so I feel like that 's sort of there yeah the thing I mean that I think yeah just I also think just the realness of the originals like there really is like very little CGI in it which is one of the damsels alone pretty cool yes rash jam on the stage okay sometimes I just forget that George Lucas actually created the prequels like they just feel so different 10-degree ain 't because the original trilogy had different directors like it was always his his mind baby and his universe but other people were like okay this is how you make a movie you know to kind of help out well I mean the prequels are step I love the prequels as well they 're so earnest yeah and when I grow up with them they make on a different thing like I 'm a noun like introducing my partner to that stuff it 's he 's like this is terrible lightning terrible like we watched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember this from my childhood but there 's the scene where qui-gon jinn and I don 't know be there on the Trade Federation oh my god and it 's like faithful like they turn into the flash and it just go on I 'll say and it 's never done again I mentioned again so it feels accidental or something yeah what in the world and it shouldn 't it 's sort of like move gems like that that I think I love the freeness boards because you 're like this is trash but I like this turned out how could you appreciate the cheesiness yeah yeah and like some of the acting didn 't really pretty cool is like I 've read a lot of stuff that like Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman and stuff they actually like had a bit of chemistry and they worked really well together and like what one scene this is the same thing oh the infamous and in fantasy that they had actually like they were doing it really well and it was George Lucas who decided to come in and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that I 've had that to repealer and I wonder I really wonder how that could work how it would have worked out and it would just left to be great acted like not only Bolton is a fantastic actor and Hayden Christensen I think a lot of people give him flack for being and it can supply or anything that he was a terrible and conspire but I 'm thinking really captured that constant change having this funder lying and inside of him and then being so conflicted and going through all of that stuff I feel like he did a really fantastic job like I watched that and I can like feel his pain and I could see that turmoil in him and like you know that scene where he 's now Darth Vader and he 's just killed all of the separatist leaders and he turns around almost afar and like he 's crying but he was like this you know he now evil and he has that change of himself where he 's like I 'm leaving the old Anakin in the past and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the reasons why I like the prequels to you is that I think a person said and emigrated did a fantastic job like cementing that as my love in Star Wars especially in Episode three I mean you 're like episode three the chemistry obviously between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman is you know a hotly debated topic but the chemistry between you and McGregor and Hayden Christensen is fantastic you know like the brothers in the comrades but then there 's also that conflict of the secrets and stuff I feel like was done so well yeah it 's fantastic I actually have you watched the behind the gallery thing for the Mandalorian not for the Mandalorian Norman jasonlew nikko my god loved it okay now we had he there 's an account remember which episode it is but he sort of goes in he 's like like on par with George Lucas he like knows the universe and he understands it so well which is why the Clone Wars is fantastic but he actually sort of had this conversation about how like the defining moment but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really cool he sort of links it into Hayden Christensen as well like the big defining moment is quite on Jin like he in qui-gon jinn didn 't die that this whole scenario could have turned out very differently like and he can never have dad and qui-gon jinn was sort of that like father figure to him and was going to become that mentor and who actually believed in him when you know everyone else didn 't live and everyone was like yeah he 's like really this kid you show up like yeah there was like a scene where everyone 's like if we feel like we 've picked up some little space trash or something like that and why would he was the only one who really believed in any cannon that he was going to be the chosen one and then when qui-gon died that 's when everything shifted like if any had the influence of qui gonn in his whole life growing up into being a Padawan and a master he may never have turned to the dark side because he would have gotten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really took him on because of wagang why because quite one last him too and then they never quite got over everyone was never that father figure to him he was always a brother and yes on that in the prequels you know they had a brotherly bond but that wasn 't enough for any kin to not turn to the dark side like in time I 'm not explaining it as well no no I did totally get what you mean he liked and is sort of stood back and I was like wow I never like I never really sort of quite punching being that important of a character Jen hiya Skywalker saga like he literally sets it all up like you know me find Anakin but like it could have changed everything so differently and it was really interesting to see that because now I look at the prequels in a very different way but after I watch that episode birthday Fulani and you gives you a new perspective and I think I appreciate the prequels more now that I 've sort of understand how and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah and him he always felt like everyone was undermining him and not seeing his full potential even though you know and everyone could be arrogant and everything then you know a Jedi was not supposed to be they all do but yeah it was really that history I 've never heard that before like you hear a lot about as far as it ties into the fact that that void and Anakin 's life is what let Palpatine kind of little sneak in there and like I guess it gets groomed him from a young age and make him feel special and and sort of filled that void left by qui-gon but in the other way and and you see sort of from the Phantom Menace that qilin is a little bit like a tiny bit of a gray Jedi like he 's kind of a little bit language yeah who cares what the council thinks and maybe that flexibility could have helped Anakin because he was so like constrained by the rigidity of it that 's ultimately what he was unable to like reconcile with yeah bros people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like didn 't seem to be happy with it at all they were just like okay I 've accepted that this is the way that things need to be in my life and yeah yeah it 's it 's very interesting I 'm gonna have to watch this it 's fantastic like it really like Jon Favreau I didn 't even realize up until I watched that that they had seven directors for the mandalorian and they all sit around and they all have a different take on things but it 's fantastic you have to you have to watch it you sort of get this insights of things that you 're like oh like the seven directors tip around and you see how hard is it to get directors and talk to each other mm-hmm and they don 't work together very very well they do very well and like you can and once you know who you directed which episode if you like oh yeah can see that influence coming out but all ties together so well I love that each director had their own personality like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor like that scene the stormtroopers trying to shoot that can and they just kept them it was so cheesy and it was so cliche but I was like oh that 's so Tiger he 's fantastic I 'm so excited for whatever me is working on yeah it 'll be an amazing amount what it is yeah yeah just you just know you just know it 's gonna be fantastic yes and I 'm very excited for the only one series oh my gosh it needs to continue I 'm Kathleen Kennedy Lisa oh wait I remember when they announced the solo movie everyone was like this isn 't what we asked for we you know what we want other than what we want I know I think and I think the fact that elumen Griego is reprising the role is like I don 't think I 've been so excited nothing yes started a long time he just embodies obi-wan Kenobi I think that 's why he 's my favorite favorite actor favorite character Adam all of like prequels originals sequels he 's my favorite yeah that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for the droids except the c-3po Hayden the droids are like the dog the Star Wars universe okay like through these innocent souls that are there that are just endlessly loyal and like if somebody kicks a droid it 's like it 's like kicking a dog like it 's just not you know sometimes people don 't want me in and I might 've let me in like r2d2 is the best he is just in like when he 's sad beeps I 'm okay it 's so strange that I can see like these human beings and these human characters and they 're like upset and it 's terrible traumatic things happen to them not huh r2d2 doesn 't sad me good little dome garbage bin shaped today and you feel so much for you and I feel like I know you don 't like c-3po but I feel like Anthony Daniels humor with him is sort of like when we first see the two of them like trudging through the sand dunes on Tatooine yeah and we obviously we don 't know what r2 is saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on like this little dream like rude and Sally and laughs yeah I definitely I can definitely appreciate that they have to be joyful r2d2 to shine like he does but like I love bb-8 yes I was expecting to be like me with this new draw I don 't want to be fake but it 's really cute to be quite old it 's like the conversation will happen before that Bobby freak I think my rejecting father freaks so much for that I know bb-8 is it a bb-8 is too cute small little creature and then even do the loot new little sweet or one I didn 't like how he talked little drive shouldn 't talk big droids can little droids man hold on my heartstrings he looks very afraid but you didn 't like that afraid I liked it because he was an animatronic like it if he watched it like a three hour long making over eyes of Skywalker and he was like a little teeny animatronic and they had animatronics in his face and in his hands anywhere and he was so like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Return of the Jedi in Jabba 's palace where you 've got like bib Fortuna as like this little puppet and job is fold it felt like that like that they 'd made these little creatures that have fully fleshed out personalities yeah yeah yeah I can see I can definitely see that but I dunno I just I 've enjoyed love intimacy to hear something about him don 't know if it 's Anthony Daniels Anthony Daniels is a little bit of a he said some pretty mean things about poor old Kenny Baker hmm I don 't know it just is not Cesar prepares not my cup of tea yeah and I would love to exclude him from everything is oh my gosh Josh would I think that like everyone to get it to spit later I one of the reasons I didn 't like ride the Skywalker is because ya had was heavy on the three beer yeah yeah and I was like Lillis yeah and like when he just you know he bruins women 's I don 't know that that 's character that he like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comedic relief sort of yeah I 'm like oh go away like in force awakens when when Han and Leia are seeing each other again especially on such a long time and he got hopes up and it 's like hopefully boom there it is my mom is right not like no one cares that was such as like a Disney like a gag for five-year-olds like a thread like almost like this is someone necessary like Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have a moment okay can we just they don 't make we do they don 't even need anything else around then just them together you 're done like all we wanted was that you know original like god I can 't we do we 're supposed to be talking about this lust like the rival Skywalker at the end but I feel like it 's we 're already starting to like it 's two things to say it 's a big L in the room sorry everyone 's your favourite Jedi yes do you have a favorite carrot oh my god I think everybody knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prequel trilogy Adam driver is the gem of the sequel trilogy I remember when also awakens first came out in the movies and I went to the mic first midnight screening of it and that scene when he takes the velvet off my first time literally the whole cinema just loved it is ridiculous he because his hair is like all like big and curly and he 's got like the chiseled out his cheekbones and he 's like like this and everyone 's like like a sort of a yeah right you 're under there and any no like obviously because you know it 's out of driver in anyway you know what he looks like and it 's it 's just this like really jarring oh yeah and I think from then like the scenes when he like loses control and he 's just actually things when Ray 's escaped and like just destroying everything and the stormtroopers are walking down they 're like no stop this very garden like I like this girl yeah like you can tell like the term well he 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because I also loved Hayden Christensen as Anakin and they had similarities of what their characters were going through this constant pull between light and dark and that anger comes with it and kind of just fantastic I feel like because he is sort of like a like a serious you know like a theatre actor and who wouldn 't normally do like big action science fiction movies maybe his approach was different to everyone else in the cast because you could tell that he was doing Hayden Christensen he things and then at the end of rise of Skywalker in there like the 10 minutes that we get to see him redeemed he was doing very harrison 40 things yeah and in that three hour long making of documentary JJ Abrams was saying that that was all him he was like should I like do like a Harrison Ford shrug surely like shooting not look should I be acting like Harrison Ford now because I 'm like then again apparently JJ was lucky I do it like it wasn 't even yeah nobody thought of it hermetically in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the things that made the end of that movie yeah I think yeah a driver as kylo Ren was the reason I sat through the last I don 't think I could have said through that you know 20 minutes and when you see what they did to Luke it 's enough to make you want to get up and walk out if there 's not other things that you kind of want to see how they pan up it 's terrible that was like I don 't everyone give some prequels like a bad rap but holy moley last year I should not have been how do you feel about the last Jedi now that we have the rise of Skywalker like Debbie has it shifted your no it 's still the worst of them all like I don 't think anything anything they could do now would redeem how terrible it was it 's just mind-boggling that they would drop four billion dollars on this and then just launch straight into making movies and they wouldn 't have like a casual chat about where they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force awakens had an end in sight and somehow Rian Johnson was just not reigned in or bullied his way into making things go the way he wanted them to go and then I get JJ Abrams back and he 's just outright and retconning stuff like it 's wild it 's like there was nobody in charge that they would just give him total creative control like it 's unbelievable that that would be allowed to happen yeah it just it made no sense and like I love the force awakens when I saw that I thought oh my goodness yeah this sequels might actually be fantastic and then not post yet I came along who knows like their game do you feel like because there was criticism when the force awakens came out people were like no it 's just a new hope again do you feel like a beige without on board and they were like you want different will give you different which produce the last Jedi and in the last Jedi everyone was like this isn 't a style chicken up and so then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay he is wedge antilles he 's old but here you look at the Tontine oh well give Chuy a medal like oh they were trying to patch holes that nobody was concerned about and not worrying about the craters left in other areas yeah I definitely think so I think you know they definitely needed to have a sample and consistency whenever it was just yet it was wild it was like just they were just throwing things out I 'm gonna be like yeah let 's do this let 's do that it 's just a big mess very big mess do you think what do you think would have happened if JJ Abrams had directed the whole trilogy I generally think it would have been fantastic yeah why do i I i loved force awakens like i genuinely wholeheartedly loved force awakens to the point where it was a closer contender to being my favorite now the entire like spiral posaga I just I loved and I think it was because you know being reintroduced to Han Solo and you know Princess Leia was there the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved feeling I love Ray and had so much potential yeah so much potential it just any new Poe I think they worked so well in the force awakens that I was so excited for the last Jedi and they just didn 't flesh out the characters in the way that they should have and I even feel like the acting way poteete I love Daisy Ridley about her acting during last Jedi and Raisa Skywalker really went downhill no but you could tell it was really scripted and she was she didn 't have the emotion she had in the first one hmm and yeah like it just if JJ Abrams how to keep going I think it would have done justice to the end of this climb good I feel like you can see threads of his ideas at the end that which is they just didn 't have the time or the room which is weird because it was such a short movie but anyway like spin as a stormtrooper realizing this is wrong I don 't want to do this leaving and then we sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I came in now this is fine let 's go to casino planet whatever like in the rise of Skywalker it 's sort of you know brought up again and he meets Jana and Jana and her crew like we heard that you left like we thought we can do this to someone else has decided to not serve the people who enslaved us as children and break out and you go okay this is going somewhere like and then it just doesn 't you know it like ten minutes after that conversation Ben is like yeah you know we we didn 't want to do it to the stormtroopers are humans under those helmets and they don 't like doing what they 're being told to do and then ten minutes later they shoot someone down and things like whoa again and it 's like not okay like so much for that theme for that character like yeah Oh seemed to be full sensitive mm-hmm okay yeah let 's just shoot that star destroy down and eldest will dine out of the anyway like you could have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that could have been a really cool resolution to a battle that was different to just we blew up the bad guys ship and we won the space war yeah which is how like you know yeah yeah oh I think yeah I just and that fresh show me because I love that so open-ended and the end of rise of Skywalker it 's like throughout the whole movie things like right I need to tell you something I need to tell you something and then you know at first I was like ah I love Stern and then move and then you start to pick up like oh crap he 's full since there and it 's just and and there 's nothing there 's like they forgot to resolve a bit something yeah it 's like okay totally could have had a bit at the end like after they 're hugging have some formal conversation like didn 't have to just end hump like that very frustrating how did you feel about like we sort of touched on the cringy things that were like faux nostalgic there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be honest when I saw a young Luke and Leia training together on Endor I cried I wasn 't bold eyes the whole time little things like that sort of show you that like the heart of it was in the right place yeah I think that 's the most that 's the biggest bummer because if only they 'd gone down the path of like embracing that kind of thing yeah I see come the moment that really hit for me that I was like bawling my eyes out was when kylo turns like you can see him turn into bed and he 's talking to his vision you know I can 't solo and he 's like dad it 's so lonely girl and thing and I was like oh my god just I loved that they I love that they resolved that mm-hmm that because that was obviously such a massive beggin oh yeah my kids like and killing his dad Carly killing his dad that he living with that because I didn 't really touch on it too much except for his hatred of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was his dad that was there when he decided he was back into the line that he was gonna stay there and yeah those little things just like that those little tiny nuggets that somewhat would make me watch it again so do you feel this is I mean it is lovely that we see Han Solo back again but do you feel like there should have been some time in that entire trilogy where kylo Ren is in his room talking to Darth Vader 's helmet being like come on grand dad give me something like I 've want to be like you grand dad what should I do that Anakin could have just taken ten minutes out of his force after life and been like you want to be like me like stop it go to the good side like go apologize to your mother like and but then apparently it 's okay for them to all talk to Ray even though she has zero connection with any of them yeah but they never had any kind of communion with Kyler is does that did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion on that bloody loss even a lot in that rises guy won 't know when I do all talk her hmm Sabina they probably could have afforded in that budget mm-hmm to bring Hayden Christensen back so just to second it was already on the payroll they hadn 't doing the voice-acting just how can we gon ' him come on guy who second two seconds I 'm here and if I I think if they hadn 't done that moment no matter where they put it if it was in the last Jedi I really wanted him to as much as I loved having Hahn as the one with Kyler when he turned it would have been the perfect moment for hating Christians and there 's any kid to come out and say hey buddy like I 'm proud of you like you know you 've done what I 've done and you turn from the dark side under how that is like I go and be good like I went live up to your legacy and squabble company no like just no bed not even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Ryan she gets up and like just oh it would like when he 's full gets thrown down into the hole like any kid putting his hand out and looking him like just this sort of any things that they could have done and didn 't and it I would have been happy I 've no matter what else happens in in Rice 's fire-god I would be happy and whom they had just done that just true even two seconds like literally just even just his hand down yeah you see his face it doesn 't even have to talk like just once they could have just done with it at the end of last of Return of the Jedi and just recycled footage and that would 've been fine anyway but I feel like that that is there was a massive Anakin shaped hole in the entire sequel trilogy it sort of stopped being about Skywalker 's a bit like the entire og and prequel trilogy a kind of about Anakin and his kid kids like it 's it 's his story and then we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new characters though and I understand that they were frustrated but everyone was like yeah but whose reign related to like she has to buy kind of that 's one of the few things I liked about the last Jedi I liked that she was nobody yeah because I liked that hold the force can manifest in anybody and you don 't have to come from because that was kind of the point of kylo that he was like drowning under the expectations of coming from this legendary family and does that mean and how does he live up to this insane expectation of this grandfather and it was kind of nice to have that juxtapose with Ray who was just nobody who just had this power that she didn 't know what to do with yeah which was a big fat retcon here in the third one but the the whole anikin thing the whole point of Darth Vader 's sacrifice at the end of Return of the Jedi to save Luke was like irrelevant because help a team like survived so what was the point of that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for force healing as like a light side thing but for the casual movie goer if you 're watching ray and kylo just healing willy-nilly you 're like oh so what did anakin like turn four he was so concerned about Padme he could have just forced healed her I guess yeah and then they just really like you when I was watching you know like where did this come from no more telling I think this is like just come let be old Adam very where it 's an obscure extended universe thing that sort of never has been in the well I suppose when you first meet old then he 's sort of like heals Luke wakes him up a bit but it 's never like expanded on because Anakin 's like terror of losing Padme is like the core of his turn to the dark side it 's really strange that they would be like yeah but you can just stop people from dying if you really want to he must he just must have really wanted to yeah maybe it 's to do with the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light side thing and maybe because he was being selfish and maybe it was to do with the fact that Ben had to turn good to be able to use that power rather than Anakin turning bad and then not being able to access it maybe that 's a theme yeah it would have been nice if we 'd like Anna knew expanded on that and like made something of it in the film yeah cuz they sort of I feel like they tied it into them being a diet and a force but I was like we also have a no explanation for dieting yeah like Apple and you know I 'm sure it 's in the universe somewhere you know it 'd be like a little more but like if you 're not if you haven 't dealt that deep it 's like what is this really and we 're going to touch on it and you sort of wonder what their connection is in the last Jedi and then it comes into being explains a diet but yeah then it just brings in it 's random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far-fetched if I hate picking shows things that were like kind of established but they didn 't bother to establish them anymore they were just like this is the way things are now like the really opening line of the crawl is like hell but somehow Palpatine has returned like they just drop it on you and go accept that now and there 's no story telling support to make it make any sense yeah and something that I was like okay the whole storyline of Mexico and Luke going on this adventure she bloody Lando Calrissian trying to find out all this information like we have never heard about this in this series they 're they don 't even touch what it does Luke is trying to do things like the whole reason Luke went and hid away was because he saw his darkness and been like there 's no nothing there about this story not line and I 'm like okay hmm there 's like zero foreshadowing was set up for the fact that Palpatine is alive because I didn 't know he was going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian so it feels thrown in because it is and it makes no sense that Luke would have known about it the whole time and not taken extra precautions to like protect the kids he was training and then been like oh my god someone evil is influencing the kids I 'm training who could have foreseen this like piña Palpatine was out there if he 'd gone on a search with Leonard just so done what do you think about and this is another like a funny thing the whole Palpatine being back but also Palpatine making Snoke like what do you think about the fact that the villain for the first two films of the trilogy was just like a puppet of Palpatine 's and that he was there the whole time but they tried to flush out and establish this new villain and and they were like yeah but someone else killed him off and we need a villain so yeah I definitely like I didn 't like Snoke those abilities he just came out it over and they were like okay yeah little rollers it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it more sense at the end that once we found out that Palpatine was behind it all but like that scene where they 're just like a bunch of Stokes in and she like Palpatine is like two Kyler um Kyler is like I killed Snoke I 'm not scared of you in Palpatine 's like oh hi made Snoke and you think all like he helped influence him in his rise to power and then it like pans over to a tube and you 're like oh he actually made Snoke and he was making more snoke 's like in case the first Snoke failed with you gonna unleash more smokes into the wounded Clampett each other no it doesn 't obvious no it 's just so much to pick apart with the Palpatine thing and the fact that he had children or a child that apparently was separate I guess he was cloning himself we 're never really told but we can just assume so it 's like disgusts me like how the team doing things like it 's it 's sort of on par with Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like it 's so lazy it 's such lazy writing to have your villain who 's been dead for however long to have like a child that nobody knew about that there 's no reason for them to have the finished amounts good mm-hmm just I was like that just wouldn 't happen his child would not have grown up in an environment where they would have been good I mean were they that good though because they apparently sold rain to protect her but they still sold her yeah play which is a bit like Oh like just girl like you can be family together just you don 't have to leave her on this random planet yeah with this big fat blubbery dude yeah they were like the best place to leave her is with this awful slug who 's gonna stab her and she 's just gonna have to like scrounge for scrubs in like extreme hardship for the rest of her life oh my god boom it just felt I I didn 't like that she ended up being a patentee I will say then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening I 'll say that made nurse like I get that way the audience the Skywalker name is the most significant name to us but to Rey she maybe spent like a few weeks with Luke he was kind of not that helpful to her in the end like Leia was much more of a mentor but she didn 't name herself ray Organa like Ben was supposedly her soul force like mate or whatever that situation was supposed to be and shouldn 't a micelle free solo like it was purely for us the audience because we know the name Skywalker yeah the same reason that she like buries the lightsabers and in turns her lightsaber on to show us the audience that it is a yellow lightsaber available now in the Disney Store like the die she looks into the camera and goes look a yellow one I ended up again and that like that it 's you know so many beats like that that felt like they were being presented to us the audience like chewy getting a medal that was just being given to the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been like I haven 't really read into all of that like stands watching Chewie to get a medal thing so that happened and I was like it was like a throwaway thing back in the day that people were like how come sure we didn 't get a medal like that 's so rude everyone else did and I feel like I don 't know if this is true but I feel like George Lucas wrote into Cannon that all in Wookiee culture they don 't you know metals and things aren 't accepted like it was written into the Canon a long time ago but I guess it 's it 's such a minor thing for them to be like fans are annoyed about this like fans are annoyed about much bigger things that you chose not to address yes I don 't like any of it so disappointing but like at gay girls at least we have other thing to look forward to yes the middle orient pretty good I was pleasantly surprised by the Mandalorian I was expecting to be like I 'm not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so obsessed about nori because he was like nothing the originals like yet he was the captured han Solo and everything like that and blah blah blah but really really debated but like yeah I don 't understand the hype around it I don 't know why people were so up and like Amanda in general I guess maybe it 's like an EU seeing and there 's books and comics that people sort of got really into but when they announce it I was kind of like yeah and I feel like they maybe knew that people were on the fence about it which is where they pulled out the big guns with maybe Yoda to like keep everyone hooked and it worked it 's all over baby Oh every day I think anybody on the planet that can like resist baby Yoda yeah but then at the ends like the season finale and I Karim ever the character 's name but he like pulls out the dark save up and everyone goes it 's the dark saber and it 's like they 're gonna go into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they maybe announcement recently that rosario Dawson has been cast as ahsoka tano in the second season oh did you not hear that whole yeah sorry it 's like a spoiler and they weren 't announced you get announcing it but it came out that rosario Dawson has been cast to play a circuit in the next season of the mandalorian so which is interesting because she speaks to Rey in the rise of Skywalker like she 's one of the jedis voices that we hear but apparently her name has been taken out of the credits now so it 's just female Jedi 3 because they don 't want her to be dead because they want to keep using her yeah yeah Oh interesting I don 't know if I can picture that her it 's a bit weird isn 't it imagining a quicker cartoon as a person now and in adults like because she 's a child and to Rosario Dawson 's like you know forty something yeah that 's why yeah I 'm just like struggling to see how that would work in see her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm 100 no I don 't know I think we 'll just have to see I mean it they 've done a fantastic job so if no casting her she 's obviously I think she was like a fan favorite as well like I feel like for a long time she 's been like pushing for the role it 's like a bit of a Ewan McGregor would be one situation where she 's been like I really want to do this and then people are like are you gonna do it and she 's like I mean I want to so it would have I think it was just a decision that probably made for them maybe yeah who knows no for them mmm so what something that I love about Star Wars is the battle scenes and how many there are what is what what is the most standout for you which one makes you be like oh my god yes I mean I I guess it 's they 're different things like if you 're just talking about like an amazing lightsaber fight it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like school behind them yeah all I call the jewel of their faiths like qui-gon and dark mole like purely just for like the music and how iconic it was alone yeah very watched that whatever you watch that I was like hmm not as cool as you remember maybe it 's something that as a kid you 're like oh my god and I haven 't I haven 't rewatched The Phantom Menace in a long time I want a family yeah I 'm surprised that they kept maybe maybe I feel like the fans who will like maybe our age when the prequel trilogy came out felt the way that we feel about the sequels and if we just give it 10 years we 'll be like totally fine with it yeah yeah but as far as like the best battle scene I feel like Luke and Vader the first time for some reason that 's yeah yeah on bespin like it 's it 's not impressive it 's like that clunky old like there 's no bones flipping and doing things and jumping and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion behind it and the fact that beta is like look you aren 't a Jedi yet and it 's like cutting Luke down it 's like the lowest point of his hero 's journey I guess yeah I don 't know how to like the emotion behind that and then when you like mirror it with Luke and beta again in Return of the Jedi and you can see like Vedas conflict and wanting to turn on Palpatine and and Luke 's optimism anything yeah yeah like James Earl Jones and voice I guess that yeah yeah I I agree with that it 's like it 's so hard watching one of the new battle scenes and stuff and fights and like like the very first light saber fight between everyone and Darth Vader and it 's like they see it 's very underwhelming yeah after you 've seen Liam Neeson doing like backflips is so significant it 's it 's the first time that the audience has ever seen it and and then I think I love like I love the Battle of the heroes with everyone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that loved it when I was a kid hmm and like it really signifies the change from him being a Jedi and like there he had I can 't be screaming they hate him like when he 's nothing like often he is the high ground and all the memes that it 's you in a sense that it is but like I don 't think anything really in the sequels hit me mmm like that I feel like that 's what smokes throne room was the posts to be yeah but maybe just didn 't get there in like the execution yeah I don 't know and I think it 's cuz it was cool to see Carlo and Ray like fly it together but usually knew that it was never going to stay that way um I but I see I don 't think I think I loved it out of the sequel 's and it 's not even like it 's just it 's like a gun fight and I 'm gonna say bourke-white when when it 's been and he 's fighting against the Knights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too because have you seen the like double on Facebook oh I need a hero over the top of it no once you see it it like is the perfect tune to like how they 've done it once you see it you 'll want to watch the normal with you never be able to see that Sookie comes with anything else but it just but do you feel like the Knights and friend probably could have gone a bit harder though yeah considering that they were like the Knights of Ren it was like a thing and we were like are we gonna get to see the Knights of Ren and then yeah they 're just a couple of guys that he has to like to ruin any moves on his adventure and it 's yeah non-event yeah it 's like in fact that we don 't really have see the last one well no like who they are or what their significance is so what their relationship is like presumably they 're like working with Kyler like it I guess it 's kind of implied that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the case then why would why would they turn on him yeah it 's like mmm other have they always been working for Emperor Palpatine like have like what is that cuz he I was like when they turned against him although oh okay yeah I guess I want to take your radiance the cool friends yeah it just was very strange but um yeah there 's not really anything in the sequels that like astounded me in this way of battles and I think I like the creep the prequels because actually didn 't some pretty still on five seems there was a lot in the prequels that has aged well I think it like obi-wan and Anakin I remember at the time I can 't remember how old I would have been but I remember sitting in the cinema being like this is taking ages like we already know what 's gonna happen everyone 's gonna win like come on but now it 's the thing you look forward to in that movie like you spend the whole movie waiting for that climax yeah yeah I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revenge of the Sith the first time we randomly went like 9 o 'clock in the morning as a family and so we 'd had like Phaedra know to breakfast and we went to the movies and mom and dad like don 't be one chuckling so your popcorn 9 o 'clock in the morning and then like the scene that resonated with me was when Hayden Christensen his Darth Vader for the first time and he 's like breaking out of his constraints he finds out Padme is dead and like the audio in the cinema was like Madden loud and then you just go through and I spell yeah deep in my soul and that 's like a moment that has stayed with me or ever that is so that the way that they shot that as well like the way that he 's framed on the operating table being turned into Darth Vader while Padme is having Luke Maya and dying and then the way that it 's framed why he 's in his beta suit and his mask goes on for the first time and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way as like Padme is like dead in her coffin like oh I know like there 's emotional beats in that that was so well done yes it 's amazing that they have stuff like that in there when there 's other really terrible pop yes it 's like justice we 've balance between the two button yeah that 's C oh yeah and I love to Pat me I love I love the women in Styles I think like Padme was always my favorite out like I know everyone loves layer and I love layer two but Padme was like the female that I am resignated with in the series and yes she was just it all wins sometimes didn 't make sense marathon I was growing up I was like hey and it can was a kid had me was an adult and then now they 're together and then I was and then I realize like she was only like 14 year at the time you 're like it took I took a year for those constituent for me to not be like mm there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen me being like confronted with a human McGregor in his prime like a young apprentice Ewan McGregor and backed out and like an eight-year-old with a bowl cut and she 's like hey you were just a bowl cut like being straight up during like it 's very funny because it is like I guess if she 's the actress she 's probably close to like 17 or 18 so she 's much closer to his age yeah yeah but it 's definitely a weird dynamic hmm creepy very very creepy get away from that so maybe wrap things up what out of these pies are the what 's your favorite movie out of all of them and why I mean I do it 's weird I feel like we haven 't talked about rope one at all but I 'll the last half-hour or so of rogue one I just love it it 's weird because it 's just nostalgia it 's because it looks very 70s and even the audio is a little bit muffled and 70s and I know that people find this like shameless fanservice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the death start and they 're trying to get it and they 're freaking out and that Klaxons going off and then it goes silent except for the klaxon and you just seem fade up like eliminating his saber in this dark corridor it 's it is like goosebumps and they trying to get the plan out and it like that 's the only time you really see him as like like you know that he has this reputation is the most evil fearsome person in the galaxy yeah but you don 't really see like they don 't show you they show you that like he 's like throwing people were even cutting them in half and it 's like this guy 's gonna decimate everyone and they need to get these plans out and it was just so well done and then it goes into the tanti 4 and the rebels have like those weird helmets on and you see like are 2 3 P oh and they get the plans to layer for some reason that to me was like I was exhilarated watching that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about I think that scene was like my dad he grew up when the originals came out he was always like Darth Vader was just this is his binky anymore he was his big bad guy that people was scared about and I was like I just don 't see it like when I was growing up watching the mouth like he doesn 't even do anything bad just breeze lad but that seemed like it 's like dead quiet except that noise and then zoom in you like oh my god and you know take it take it oh you just was away the rebels are like the way that they for it out when they see him it 's just yeah because we see him intimidating his co-workers you know being evil in meetings and choking people and all of that which kind of feels almost comedic now because it 's so engrained pop culturally like for us we know what darth vader looks like and we know that he chokes people but like that sells like him like something out of a horror movie it was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like really you think about one of the early times you see him actually engaging with the rebels like just you know royally rebels no big hidden character hmm which i think is yeah why it 's fantastic yeah didn 't think about right one that I loved everything about where you want it was really fantastic yeah I think for me as much as I love everything else return on the Jedi love it I have a thing with Star Wars where I love like the third movie and everything except for us you know um there 's just something about it like everything I think they wrap stuff up really nicely and Return of the Jedi and I love the Ewoks and that last scene I 've never watched the version where they use the youngnam song um I grew up with the one where they had been but the food yeah yeah yeah I loved it and I feel like that it just was the perfect song and you know when they like once a prequels come out and they take those videos of the galaxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just something about it you see all of these characters who have been gone through everything and like just come into their own and it 's just something about it it 's just fantastic it was always my favorite when I was a kid and it still is my favorite so without intervention force if yeah I love I love that because I love Hayden Christensen 's change into being in like order 66 and everything just all those real I love those ex dad seems and then they really be seen somehow they meld really well together I think you 're right about the third movie the way they do the bittersweet endings like but Luke is sad you 've let like his father two recipes with his friends and his sister and episode three the ending like that final final scene of episode three is just it 's like another goosebumps scene you know everyone giving baby Luke to Lars and burro and Beru looks at him and take them up understand Jun and they 're watching the sunset and everyone like disappears off into the desert like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like that like they just have done that so well and that 's why you know the sequels are sort of to decide because they haven 't done that yeah and like I love the Jabba the Hutt saying where you know Princess Leia is in her her Java slinging a bit and like just strong everything about it is just strong and I loved it so yeah I think as much as I hate for the last ones like this firewalker song like I 'm still gonna love Star Wars be honest and I 'm really excited for the side project so I 'm coming along I feel like at this stage they 've invested so much they 're gonna keep doing them and they 're only going to get better because they 're gonna listen to what hopefully people are saying like I mean Mark Hamill has said that they don 't care if it 's good they care if it makes money he 's obviously been very badly burnt by it yeah so they want to keep making money they got to make him good otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money from solar yeah I 'm excited to see what comes me Jerry solar was like an inoffensive like you know I just didn 't really care about new home console or am i okay yeah it was a bit weird how they felt the need to gin everything we know about came into that one movie yeah I could get stuff all can he make blender he meets Chewie in the space of like three days and that 's all the stuff we know about him at the character so they had to put it in there yeah yeah yeah it definitely wasn 't the sort of sign maybe that mm-hmm yeah but we thought he got it I 'm going to take what you can get yeah yeah Disney never happened to watch this please listen to your fans and we want hoping not crap yeah some of us are very invested it some may say too invested but we 're invested um well I think we 'll wrap it up there so thank you very much Sam just another reminder it 's free to join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wars items that you can learn out for free with

Hulu Commission yes why we will gather here today to have a conversation so obviously you can see our first topic is Doctor Who for our talk show and we 'll be delving deep into the world of Doctor Who and as we may be discussing some stuff about some of the new seasons that you may not have watched yet okay so basically what we 're going to do today is to sit around have a talk about some of our favorite doctors and you may also see we 've got a ladder here so we will also be having a fun little game of choosing who our favorite doctor is within the library so we 'll be going through and voting between all four of us from our least favorite doctor to our favorite doctor and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will have a little crown on this so let 's get started mmm first things first who is everyone 's favorite doctor mine is maximum like straight up Matt Smith why I don 't know he was I mean I started with David Tennant but Matt Smith I think it was just like such a boy lunch I like he 's childlike she should yeah and and yeah and like I don 't know there 's something about him that I really really enjoyed all of his episodes the storyline is all of his seasons oh my god and I said sorry coming off like Tennant as well who was like so serious and he wasn 't I came so playful amazi yeah he was really sassy I guess they 've all got stashed in their own way but he wasn 't as like I don 't want to say dopey but just cha he wasn 't as childlike he didn 't have that quality about him I feel yeah so yeah I can see why you 'd like him I 'm the same I absolutely love the 11th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and watch the other ones but yeah eleventh is always stuck with me I started with Eccleston but I 'm going with tenants he is my favorite his seasons just stick with me the most I think I like that yeah he was serious when he needed to be it but she had that little bit of humor that made me giggle and Tenant just 10 another way like in all of David Tennant yeah and he does that thing with these mouths well yeah that fan sometimes I 'm just like you not to that please just enough distracts me I don 't want to go on to like a different TV series at all but have you ever seen friends and Joey has the acting instructions that you have just obviously David Tennant is a brilliant actor yeah like I feel like David Tennant is like the og doctor you know a lot of people were introduced to the new universe David Tennant is like the poster boy for it but I don 't know I feel and I think that I like reject him because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too mainstream but like everybody loves doing yeah Tennant yeah yeah I don 't know if this is true or not but I think possibly why he 's so big is because would say the first one to like introduce it to the states like and make it sort of a bigger thing over in America and that 's why he sort of has such traction with people because he 's such a big probably yeah like comic-con and stuff like that cause he 's like outfits were quiet by morning yeah very easy to my placate yeah where is christopher eccleston like his outfit small so just casual wear a leather jacket yeah yeah just why a lot of people like him for that reason yeah I like him I 'm stuck between 9 and 12 only because I do like that rough thing about that Chris 's portrayal but I really also enjoy I feel like 12 it 's a good mixture of 10 and 11 because he kind of just keep bringing fish and you also like plays on that a little bit and he he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and giving Doc like just her on there he just like at the young you 're just like haha yeah does he not come off cheesy you know um like German like overly dramatic or maybe maybe that 's what I 'm feeling I just feel like a bit cheesy yeah is that Peter or Peter yeah dude I think sorry I don 't need just me but I think like I think what they wanted to do with him as well as like we 've had all these young doctors yeah yeah classic where they 're all men but you know let 's get out of that I liked that but um hey yeah he 's like perfect mix between Chris Ferguson he 's always like yeah some eyebrows eyebrows yes eyebrows seeks pick trees no eyebrows and the whole thing where he does that yeah yeah but then he has like that sort of playful silence well that I really like no I feel like came out really well with Clara yes yes I agree which is like Harriet here is your favorite companions or your your specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joel I 'm a dunce they love a companion more than I love the yeah like they are my heart and it 's like the perfect combination everything with the importance the whole storyline same with River Song yeah just mixing in absolutely like the best of friends in real life and I came through so well in the actual show I know like Oh beautiful with River Song I 've who do you like her better with 11 or 12 I love it 11 really yeah I love I would 12 oh I think there that I feel like their chemistry was a lot better just because or maybe it was just because of the storyline and where they were in your story but no I just I loved her with 12 I 'll have to go a limb yeah I think it was it was that very like Chi Chi Chi yeah I 'm you 're loving like sexy type of relationship where they were both like same age and marry and ice cream interesting too because she 's in a completely different timeline to what here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about himself excuse me when I first saw it yeah I was like what and then when everything like reset and I 'm like I don 't understand what 's going on and then I have to like watch it again to really get it but it 's really it gets sorry confusing recently went back and watched a lot of Matt Smith 's stuff and I didn 't watch it in order like I 'm just having person who are going watch my favorite episodes what do I like yeah like watching bags go make it happen I mean I don 't want to go and search for it no we go back yeah we go back yeah but like I feel that all of the ponds and River Song and that whole zorad merge so well that they could they never do anything wrong yeah I feel like Clara she was right with eleven but she really became like a companion for me when she was with 12 oh yeah yeah I think it 's the very first companion like real for a particular doctor really like yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had quite a few companions Rose like was a really big key part of his yeah sort of thing yeah I think Clara 412 is exactly yeah I hated the whole storyline of like Clara pining up that yes that that made the rest of like he had seasons with her really unenjoyable for me yeah and that was probably the only time I 've decided that I didn 't like Matt Smith as well oh she turns me off those later seasons of with Matt Smith because I just didn 't like their chemistry I hated yeah that mm that love story thing yeah because she 's so used to River with the doctor yeah yeah it was a protective thing with him or lightning just I just didn 't and I didn 't like their chemistry like I know though around the same age and everything but when you take away that relationship in that you know type of thing the friendship in the platonic friendship between the twelfth doctor and Clara get work sorry well like when when Danny Oh see that little I come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really enjoyed Donna 's she 's my favorite because yeah there was she was just him as a human yeah just it doctor Donna you know and she she suited him and she was what he needed in that time because that 's all he wanted he just wanted someone to travel oh yeah you want to mate not make sunshine Vicki laughs but yeah I really enjoy her her timing her storylines really sucky at the end like I get that she 's only there a sort of to help him grow in that sense but he hadn 't asked I feel like it was a real eye-opener sadhana like yeah that she got that like she deserved to become that most important person because she lacked that sort of confidence in herself yes I feel like the whole Doctor Who series is really good at being able to show people even if you I really like hopefully self-esteem in yourself yeah you are important like that 's shown in Madonna that 's shown in eleven it 's just yeah really that 's a good point yeah yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donna and Rose yeah I am a sucker for a love story and there 's no better love story to me than Rose and I got a doctor there 's it 's just beautiful and I like how Rose was an everyday person like I feel like Clara she 's quite intelligent I 'm raises don 't get me wrong but I think I connected more with her and Donna 's attitude yeah yeah like you said earlier I just I can 't get over Donna she 's me she 's everything the doctor needed yeah yeah yeah she needed him and he needed her yeah it just worked so well and yeah how it ended just like that first episode where with the um he like she brings back his humanity I guess like that side of him that 's not as cruel and not as yeah violent I guess because he 's just ready to kill that wreck something yeah yeah this Spider Queen nice pot-au-crème [Applause] yeah right yeah I just feel yeah yeah what he needed was someone to stop him because feel like Rose did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on doing this show My partner and I have decided to start from Eccleston so last night we started and I just didn 't I forgot how compassionate Rose was yeah so we just we just up to that episode and she touches the Dalek and her emotions and her go through go through to the Dalek and like yeah it 's beautiful yeah that 's a issue I don 't do from killing him yeah yeah so I think that 's why I well I love both Donna and Rose because they just bring out so much in the doctor yeah I think they 'd probably be too much sass if you put nine and Donna any of them and Donna would be great well just be bickering yeah I also really enjoy Captain Jack oh yeah like he 's he 's dreaming and I love how they just smash through the barriers like Captain Jack flirts with lazy to talk I might have a chance our least favorite doctor now me personally because I haven 't really had too much to do with Jerry Eve she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like the new will her first season I know they tried to introduce a lot of new monsters and all that but I feel like yeah they had a dolly maybe she saw him and it just needed a bit more like they brought in so many new monsters at once that it was sort of yeah like she 's a new doctor new companions everything that you sort of maybe needed a few more original monsters just to sort of keep it connected I mean I haven 't seen I haven 't seen season 12 which is the latest ones in it yeah eleven yeah that 's the last one that 's available on like your streaming services but that first season feels really disjointed player it 's not it feels very separate to the Doctor Who universe I mean which is why I didn 't really think of it and then she talks she she 's ready I think she 's northern England well 12 was Scottish yeah yeah yeah David Tennant Scottish of us get David speaks very close yeah I don 't know that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't like you can 't tell he 's Scottish so you can 't pick up his accent well he 's the doctor I 'd like to be able to talk that quickly and hiding your accent yeah I think that 's pretty impressive so I can 't really comment I guess I have not gone up to Jodi I found Capaldi really difficult to get through so we did stop I 'm fighting through it now so I am putting Capaldi as my least favorite because I could not get through it alright I have been advice to push through and I 'm doing that I wish there 's a one called e1 journey what about you oh I 'd have to say charity I just lost interest like there wasn 't enough storyline quick enough sort of thing for it to hold my attention I 'd have to keep watching it but because I think a storyline came in towards the end of the season that I stopped out which I haven 't watched yet so I would have to say Jody yeah great doctor herself I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've seen people say that 's what it is like you they don 't feel like she 's reaching her potential as as like because she got so much flack for being the new doctor being a woman doctor and then having storylines that don 't exactly match up with what 's been happening yeah previously so yeah I thought I don 't know if this is true I caught an episode and I feel like even the my the quality is different like I felt really weird watching it like it just didn 't feel like junk to who when I watched it but like I said I can 't really judge it I have not seen her beginning I have noticed that as well I feel like the episodes themselves are really rushed yeah yeah creaming a lot of storyline into each episode but not necessarily across the season yeah yeah feel that 's what made it let 's face it that 's why we love doctor hurry we love the time that we put into it because then you can catch all these little hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if it is rushed I don 't know if it is or not it 's not a good path to go down for Doctor Who yeah yeah okay well three votes for Jody that means sorry dirty Oh our least favorite so now who knows what her story yeah I hear you good things about the next season yeah yes yes I heard some interesting like an interesting storyline so does that come from her banker I 'm hoping it 'll be nice but okay so favorite episodes of Doctor Who ever oh are you my mummy oh that 's my favorite I go back to it every time that one 's good it it does scare me but I just love it I love how they still reference to it later on yeah yes like how much in tenants one way he 's with I think it 's with Martha and there 's something happened he puts a mask on and a good one you can just say are you my mummy yeah so everyone I mean so yep favorite it 's hard isn 't it it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinosaurs on space Oh face like traicee traicee the choice their I mean I 'm not gonna lie Oh shot and died I was like why yeah why always kill the fun-loving it kind dinosaur because they 're cruel they love doing it you can say this but uh yeah I love that one I mean I didn 't particularly like the villain in that episode but I think just the like extended cast of Nefertiti and the yeah yeah yeah okay I 'm hunter oh I like that just worked out really nicely and Brian yeah yeah Brian is yeah I 'm sad I 'm also actually bringing in such a wonderful character such as Brian so late into the season with the pawn yeah in two episodes and then done yeah he 's fantastic I would love to some loved to have seen it was like all on him I mean cool he would be fantastic you know he 's like I 'm carrying his trowel [Laughter] I would probably have to say wedding of River Song I think that was one of the finals for 11 it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two part I just feel like it summed up so much of this series and I just got so excited because you could pick out little bits and come absolutely amazing just to that whole part little series that they had and I loved it I 'm gonna be super cheesy but I love that part where they 're getting married and then she says to him or the doctor says to River you you make you make a better kiss the bride or something like that and she 's like you better make it a good word or something like that I was like ivory watched that like a harder like it just felt yeah it just felt good because I 'm like are they finally like [Music] into it I loved that little like sneaky little escape he does at the end to get out of there oh yeah and it leads to so many of the other episodes and I feel like they do that really well and Doctor Who yeah at like all of the season final sort of thing that they leave him back like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back Martha comes back Rose comes back and then Donal and they do that sort of for each and young each one cycle of reunion yeah nice and star Bua yeah you miss your companions yeah like you grow an attachment to them and they just go yeah as we have to grow old apparently what 's your favorite season of your doctor I think for me mine season six the Matt Smith I right in saying that I loved the my favorite probably would be the first five episodes of season seven that is the play yeah and all part of the ponds time and then obviously I don 't really like it after that with Clara in it but yet probably season six as a whole I love that whole story time and the silence yes I don 't think I answered the muster but that was one of because um because I 'm me and I 'm just me and I have a favorite of things so I have like tops Howdy 's go top three top three would be the third one would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River and 12 and she doesn 't really she doesn 't realize that he 's him but she he 's confused she 's like Hello she 's like who are you that whole that whole episode is just great where she where he takes her to drilliam and that 's when that the last story arc you know yeah and that would be with my third one the second one would be the tenants angels episode oh yeah don 't sleep yeah what 's a cool blink that one link that one 's good yeah that one scared me it 's my scary yeah which touches on what is that one my absolute favorite one I would have to say we just grew what I should listen anyway is the one where in Smith 's time where what 's-her-name they go to that planet outside of the universe like the bubble thing and if the TARDIS comes tomorrow yeah yeah that 's it that the chemistry that those two I was brilliant and I was like aha I could watch this forever just the two of them going on adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's the pretty one yeah that 's that 's a great episode and I think they really did that really well like to turn her into a person yeah because you have those interactions with the doctor and the TARDIS like the TARDIS to take them somewhere else they need to be or will refuse to do something and I feel like they really brought that out and yes so what does he call it sexy yes okay when I get back into the TARDIS and Amy 's like did you wish really hot like that oh I do wish that yep that was a ongoing companion thing that would have been cool well I guess the TARDIS is sort of like a companion yeah yeah because yeah often speak to her as if she 's yeah favorite season probably yeah I 'm not charlie sure which is which I think they 've all sort of blurred together for Matt Smith but definitely the main season with the ponds just their whole storyline the resetting of the universe I just love it doesn 't love the plotline of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love rose and I do love Eccleston as well so from season one with Chris onwards bad wolf is my favorite yeah season in yeah with the part of the yeah but I think it starts in the episode where they 're stuck in Parliament yeah then you think you start a green monster around yeah yep yep like I think like I said I started again last night and like you pick up on the little cookies so like one of the helicopters what 's called bad wolf and just things like that so it starts quite early yeah okay I think we should maybe you choose to our next favorite doctor is um me probably Christopher Eccleston I think everyone else I 've got some form of connection to once I really love his season where there 's also only one season yeah so it 's sort of hard to attach to him in the same way I 've attached to the other doctors yeah my Mary Christopher I have the same sort of thought like loved his season but he 's not really a favorite doctor but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my least okay so one Christopher one Peter oh yeah would have to go with the Ninth Doctor I just yeah got to attach to the 12th like because it was longer you had that sort of running so yeah I have to say more but I have to say Matt yeah I would be close I actually I don 't know why but I really enjoy I really enjoyed me saves me I have nothing against his like portrayal Vanya I just feel he David outshines him just a little bit more and I feel like he does and I 've yeah it has to be mad I just I really I feel like David set up his story a lot and he you know which I think they all do and in a way but yeah that 's gonna be maximum Oh interesting but I mean well look he 's not laughs oh yeah okay I don 't feel the same way about that too I connected with him so well in with his one season he 's lonely one season I did feel like if he didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them yeah that 's a good point it 's a good foundation yeah yeah he said he said everyone else I 'm happy things not okay yeah mine is the Angels Take Manhattan yeah but like in sad way but a happy way like that scene where Matt Smith is crying and gravy on me but I was like okay yes so heartbreaking especially because they 've just gotten sort of river song back sort of thing that she 's been visiting the parents she 's I guess becoming more in the family and then she has to stand there and watch like if she doesn 't physically watch Amy is gone then it will come for the doctor in her so she can 't break down yeah and they have parents who have just been taken like she won 't be able to ever see them again well in her storyline she does but like not in the way that she knows Matt that time when everybody knows everything oh yeah storyline has smoothed out to the point where like Rory 's back alive after dying and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come together to work out really well for them and then gone back in time but then like that whole I don 't know thief but I 've seen it oh I 'm saying oh no you don 't have to say it I really wish they 'd film save so many people that are watching that may not know what we 're talking about Asians at the end of the Angels Take Manhattan there 's a written scene that was never filmed about it 's just a storybook just a newborn like just a pencil the in storyboard with Arthur Darvill talking over the top of it O 'Brien Rory 's dad obviously because for him it 's only been a week since they left from the last episode and he told them to go on this adventure and then they 're never coming back yeah so it goes into that and it turns out that Amy and Rory adopted a child in the 1940s when after they got sent back and obviously this child is now much older than Brian is but he knocks on the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever gonna see you again we got sent back in time really sorry we love you but this man here is your grandson and then it just cuts to like Brian dropping the letter on the ground and like going and hugging his grandson and it was like the most awesome named about like yeah it 's it 's so and you can see it play in your mind you know it 's not anything special but just with with Arthur talking over it and you just like oh you just imagined it in your head because that was something that really played on my mind I was like yeah way back in tell Brian yeah whirring Amy I 'm never coming back and then that was that final little piece that pulled it together and I think it was so beautiful that it was just the story boya like I would have loved to have seen it fully played out but I think just that simplicity of it really hit home a lot more than what it will do I really feel like the the ponds ending is sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there were those episodes leading up to that one where they were confused about their life with the doctor and having a life of their own I mean because I can 't obviously they can 't have children anymore because what happened and I just feel like in that moment where Amy was like what do i do do i I want to be with with my husband and I want to stay here and she makes that decision and she 's happy with it yeah and she even though she 's really sad she 's like this is I want to be with Rory and this is your one way it 's I think it 's the final of her oh yeah very start of her time with the doctor she just wants to go to that extraordinary yeah like life with the doctor and then yeah we see them progress we see them grow up yeah then they have a child basically with River and then there 's a time where they actually raise River sort of together well she ends up being their friend Oh somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her final sort of arc she is coming to the conclusion she 's had that amazing life it doctor it 's the sorry library yeah yeah like yeah Rory always sort of came second and I think for me personally I don 't think it was even a choice of saying the doctor for Amy at window Rory was sent back in time and that was it I 'm going back like I want to be before II and I knew that was so amazing that she finally been able to not have that split second thought of the doctor or glory before it I 'm so much for her he died a million times and yeah and see that was like the second time that happened in the episode like the first time they were up on the building and yeah it 's gonna be just Rory yeah it 's just she win with here yeah and so yeah she 's already made that connection yeah so I didn 't know about the storyboard so I think about now you explained it so well and I had like way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine was I don 't want to go but now mine would have to be with 12 and river and when he takes it to thoroughly Amanda he 's he 's very what 's the best way to describe it he 's not very telling of what 's happening and he 's he goes to these lengths to make it beautiful for her because he knows that this is their last night yeah together and he wants to to make it special for her because he does actually love her and you 're just just that whole thing but I think just before that when they 're on the ship and she is every time I say this I watch over and over again and she doesn 't realize that he 's there and they want to like use her as bait to bring him to the ship and he flatted she just says things you know if you loving the doctor is like loving the stars you conics you can 't expect a sunset to admire you back and I 'm just like he 's right he loves you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just when he 's like how I swing me and she 's like and I love when we find that we 've been told like only 11 that she will die sort of thing on that night but then we find out it lasts for 24 years yeah so it 's really sad but it 's just really bittersweet because you know she 's I know I was like that 's it then you know she 's going to the library after that and yeah it 's just it 's all these emotions yeah mines also Angels Take Manhattan yeah I think my favorite my sort of saddest scariest has a lot to it the Angels yes day night I think well aside from being a child properly watching it was two angels yes they usually yeah oh my lord quite was yeah and I my grandma 's house is full of rules yeah oh my god that would have been horrible like Grandma and they every episode therein has a level of gets me yeah yeah what it is anything they are I think they probably my favorite Finland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah I didn 't you what is it about them it 's just like I I was never like super scared of thing because my ah you just get back in time yes but it 's still that element that scares the bejesus out of you yeah yeah make it even more scary yeah I think yeah maybe it 's just because like you can 't ever really beat the Angels yeah yeah some things that like you can escape from them but you can never truly be yeah yeah I always wondered like if you took like a hammer to it would it do anything like what could you destroy it that way like they 've never tested that theory like if you just stare at it and swing a hammer at it cuz it 's started life could you made it that way never thought that because yeah because I know that they 're like we don 't know if that 's what they actually look like when you blink because they move and they your turn to stone when you look yes or sir like if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the angels yeah the eleventh Doctor and they 're under the mountain and it 's flashing and that just adrenaline and you can 't see them when you see them and the one that the part in that one where Amy 's in the trailer and she 's like watching yeah I said that got me anything that has the image comes through the forest with her I may be scared scared scared of the doc yes or anyone 's get in the doctor I don 't know like how they played it with with the Angels the episode where with my fire is it and intense one I 'm pretty sure and it 's the shopkeeper oh it 's the shopkeeper no it 's the best friend well that seemed link isn 't it yeah and then how how she tracks them when they 're looking at each other yeah they 're like that eternally stuff like that cuz yes unless someone goes in there so yeah I guess that 's a way to sort of do it I like just like if you got a mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah I think so yeah sure so the mirror breaks we hold okay I think maybe we should get going with you so for me look I 'm gonna be a bit controversial Tennant oh yeah I think I love Peter Capaldi doctor well so much that I will I think yeah those tenets number three it might smack Smith oh I would have to say Capaldi I just yeah loved Tennant and Matt Smith more I guess I guess I found it very hard to like Capaldi to start with like what you did love him but for David Tennant Matt Smith it was really quick to be able to connect and enjoy them Hey finally we get to put peter up i could change my mind when i finish to see late this season he monologues so well though my legs are so on point I feel things okay well I guess we 're gonna have a bit of a battle King okay finally is something that I 've really loves and it 's so my client a doctor who is probably say the title sequences and theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love dirty Whitaker 's first the final sequence remaining weird dubstep trippy pipe off it I 'm like okay every time comes on amok myth some I don 't really like a little mess its title sequences and theme songs doctor I know my favorite yeah it 's Jodie Whittaker the original og classic ooh yeah William Hartnell that 's true because it is isn 't it it 's really yeah it 's fantastic all the David Tennant cuz that 's iconic yeah I 'm with David Tennant the other third isn 't it too too much for me I don 't know too funky I 'm not sure what my favorite is but I 'm not too sure about Jody 's I think the music 's fine but I just I find looking at it it gets just too much like with it being split down the middle and mirrored and I just yeah yes funky come on I just need a boring yeah especially the old I like Peters one I think he 's good I think I really liked kids and they had like flashing appreciable might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I think galaxy like yeah very sweet I 'm like the Y I 'm yeah that 's like DS and stuff I don 't know like David Tennant was just like my prime doctor hurry yeah time so I had it as my ringtone on my phone at school and everything like that so that 's probably why that one sticks with my demise that 's fantastic yeah I think visually I like Peters but the sound I like that is yeah yeah yeah it that I feel like David 's is more in tune with the white classic yeah like William Hartnell Oh G yes style we hear like has anyone heard the song called doctoring the TARDIS it 's like Doctor Who hey eighty I was like one of my best memories as a kid like my dad used to have it on a CD you and we driving around oh and you know Billy 's really cool like songs that I love listening to now but like it 's the top sorry and like the video clip is just as car with like sirens I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans inside of the like it 's fantastic like if you have not I put this to everyone if you haven 't ever listened to it go on YouTube and look up doctoring the TARDIS I think it 's by the Timelords or something like that like they 're an actual band oh oh and it you 'll you 'll rip your only recognise it as soon as you hear its best and when we were like planning this that 's the only song I was it was on the paint fantastic but I like links into probably all my earliest memories of Doctor Who yeah like a fern I think the first episode I watched was with my dad and it was super old and it was just these brainy ins flying around London like but terrible quality back in the day yeah and I don 't know what doctor it was one episode it was whether I was just tripping like it was that 's the first thing I 've watched with my dad and and then it just evolved into I love Doctor Who and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best time to do that yeah I think Maya Ellis earliest memory is not so much an episode but yeah the connection I had with my mum so my mum is obsessed with Doctor Who 's we have Daleks in the house we have plans on how to make your in TARDIS your own darling we have all sorts of stuff at home like the Dalek is remote control so like we used to just chase the dogs around with is pretty cool but mum is also into like Star Trek and Star Gate and everything like that so I was always really hesitant my um not watching that Giga yourself earliest memory that was just sitting down and watching it with mum and just thinking this is crazy and then cuz I was quite young I was thinking I 've no no what shows like it is so I sat down watched it I just loved it yeah yep I feel like a lot of people just fall into it yeah more of a feeling and then yeah yes yeah it 's a yeah it brings back like smelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine isn 't sort of like happy and wine was um must have just come on TV after flicking through one day brother and I on brother and we saw an episode of the Angels sorry it 's under around no good when it 's that under the mountain it 's scary creepy both my brother and I rigged up so much by found out it was cool doctor and then yeah kept watching from that isn 't it cool though like even though you had no idea what the show is about you had how you heard of it before not just desert you don 't flicked it on it but it 's still appeal to you in some sense yeah and you like some what yeah yeah yeah mines completely we oh I don 't know if it 's weird but I had never seen classic who hmm sorry yeah me and my dad used to sing the theme song but he instead of going the hip he 'd make like he 's anything he 'd be like really good really good no it 's really cool oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my that was my introduction into climbing out what Doctor Who is and then I started watching it again well I started watching it exactly the same episode as you scrolling through ABC like six years ago and I was like I 'm gonna watch this but it more appealed to like the horror side of oh maybe yeah I like horns this is this looks scary I know what it is yeah yeah but that was I didn 't even see the full episode I just saw a bit and there 's angels and stuff moving around we 're like not really let 's change though i watch the second half of that like story and I was like I 've no idea what 's going on but I want to find out you know yeah yeah again probably not the best epic to stuff it on if you don 't like to be scared yeah yeah it 's Doctor Who you just like my part madman with a box there 's something about it it just hold you have loved it whatever just forever and ever yeah I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like we all enjoy sci-fi we all enjoy fantasy in that shipping so perfect mixture of everything for a sci-fi fantasy it 's great yes awesome yeah yeah yeah Super Show yeah okay who is ready to crown our winner I feel like we 're gonna have a little bit of a debate yeah yeah I 'm like 100% I 'm asking it 's 100% Tennant say I am easily convinced so if you could convince white oh okay let let me present why first me okay I think because he did really like spring doctor who into the thing that it is he really did propel it to the popularity that it has today and he 's just I I just I like Matt 's portrayal of of him but I just I Tennant appeals to me more on like a just feeling something like with the whole story with rose and then he 's his story with Donna and I just Donna 's my favorite companion and you just have that I have I feel like I have more of a connection with David than I do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I can 't remember who said it Matt Smith he 's quite playful and he 's quite boyish but I like the playfulness and the seriousness of David Tennant there was a good mix like Matt Smith he is serious when he needs to be but I just feel like David Tennant showed more I feel like they was just playing on that too there was sort of like it didn 't really connect for me when he would go from this serious God you just gotta do that character like character part of it with Matt and then go to that playful boyish side yeah I just you know when he 's making stuff up and he 's just being goofy which is still fun and yeah but I just feel like you said David just ties out even together a lot better yeah and I feel like to have a tenant was more like for the villains he 's more intimidating and yeah like if I was a villain I wouldn 't be scared of Matt Smith except for Matt Smith 's first episode where he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hmm oh and he 's getting dressed and he 's he 's becoming the doctor and he 's talking about hell yeah and like that pot was cool I was like yeah that 's pretty cool you have yeah uh I don 't know I feel like yes I do see that seriousness playfulness in Tennant is really like level yeah well equal I do find though that you can get really dark with David Tennant like I guess that is from like previously the war doctor and that and he 's still trying to move past that I like that though yeah not too sure I feel like he could get a bit too dark sort of thing yeah but I do find that Matt Smith had I guess it was part of his character he was trying to just move past that he was trying to forget that whole dark side of him so it only did come out certain part sky yeah so he tried to keep that goofiness that optimism as he was yeah to try and move past that whole thing even if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but um yeah denial about he didn 't try to move the past yeah and I guess that moved into 12 as well like yeah he became sort of like a more kind of brighter once he worked out his issues sort of thing with Tanner do you ever change my mind I 'm a hundred percent on tenants but I have not done well for the others yeah oh I tell why 'd you leave to me well we just crammed them both yeah look I think I completely understand everybody I think has always been my number one just because his whole storyline everything about him just appealed to me in such a way but I do agree that David Tennant is the RG and as much in my height that I feel like it would be a disservice to put in a second but doing yeah we ground you we look like autographs we are Townsville city library near the pot leaning over debris gosh don 't worry Peter you know obviously we know that everybody has well it 's a very different opinions about who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the comments if you like um and here 's a question about through how we 've done this whether you agree with the ranking that we 've done or why you like certain doctors we would love to get engaged and you all which is why we also have some trivia questions so um they should be popping up on the screen now we will leave those ones there until in the comments so that you can go back in through tryna some try not a news google you know that you may or may not there 's a few there that i had to think twice so we 'll leave those there and then we 're going to give you guys the answers in our next episode which will be Harry Potter so Harry Potter fans who are missing out on having discussions with your friends or family which is the whole point of milk and two sugars we want to

little tiny ears and keep us quiet as mice as we read our next story okay this is a pretty special one and it features some of the really cool sea creatures we might have don 't talk about this one is called paint with magic written by standing Wooten and illustrated by Pat Khan excellent oh if I can get it open I sat in my room on a cold rainy day trying to think of a fun game to play I grabbed my new paint box from under the table paint with magic it says on the label he paint with magic it looks like a magical paint box I painted an octopus in a blue sea but when I had finished he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're gassed in alarm huh I 've only got seven you 've lived off one arm oh my goodness the painting is talking the octopus grinned I felt slightly faint there really was magic inside this paint whoops I giggled I 'll fix it please wait thank you he waved yes that feels great look at all of those octopus legs I 've got one two three four five six seven and eight that sounds about right then the octopus said please grant me a wish the sea is too blue it needs colorful fish so I mixed up bright use and painted with care fish what 's a fish but I didn 't stop there magical fish I painted a whale then you know what I did I added a dolphin array and a squid I took a deep breath thump-thump went my heart as I waited a tick for the magic to start look how beautiful those paintings are Michaela absolutely beautiful they have very cool fishes fishes and sea creatures fish flurried by with the gleam in his eye and a flap of his flippers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the water before it looks something like this what 's next the Ray gently glided I jumped and I shouted from the whales blowhole misty spray sprouted wow it 's fantastic this magic is strong I put down my brush but before very long the octopus ground he was not satisfied have you forgotten about the low tide please paint a starfish and crabs they 're cool sometimes you 'll find them inside a rock pool see what I said crabs are pretty cool and look at mr. octopus he 's upside down on no but we painted them in still not satisfied how about a sea urchin the octopus cried we 've got our starfish our cool crab and our sea urchin that a little bit spiky no no you wouldn 't want to I mixed up more paint and added a few but the octopus said before I was through if it 's not too much trouble I 'm Beach would be grand somehow I managed to squeeze in some sand whoa I wonder if this is in Townsville down and that was drained we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I painted enough no he 's still wanted more calorie still wanted more it 's a very unhappy octopus yeah what else could he want oh don 't forget shells they 'll look nice on the shore they do look very nice I remember when I was a little kid I used to go pick them up off of the beach well look at them and see if I could find a crab in them I grumbled a bit and I began to get cross who was the artist here who was the boss oh I don 't think it was no I 'm not mr. octopus but I 'll teach him a lesson I said with a grin I leant over the paint box dipped my brush in and painted a shark with a terrible bite the octopus squirmed and squealed with right look at those big sharp teeth from I felt really bad so I mixed up some green seaweed I knew would help alter the scene I wonder how that 's gonna work when the seaweed looked right the octopus hid alongside the dolphin the Ray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures through the seaweed any more that 's pretty good for our sea creatures they 're not gonna become a snack today oh but look all of a sudden the creatures were still there was not a blank space on the sheet left to fill look our big friend the whale has come along and filled it all up the magic grant out paint had all dried but the octopus smiled and he looked satisfied bhai very nice isn 't it I gazed at my picture it was very clever it 's my best work my best painting ever I grabbed a clean sheet I knew what to do I picked up my brush and began something new ah he 's gonna start drawing dinosaurs I love dinosaurs just like I love crabs I took a deep breath thump-thump went my heart as I waited a tick for the magic to start

4810, Australia",2044,good morning everyone and welcome to our baby rhyme time today my name is Michaela and I 'm with the city library 's Townsville so just a few messages to start with it 's never too early to sing or share with your baby and that 's a great way to teach them how to talk and it 's also a great way for them to learn sounds and actions so it 's best to have the bub in front of you facing you so that they can watch you as you are there foremost and first teacher but if they don 't want to lay there and they want to wriggle around that 's fine you can still interact with them as best you can okay so first as we usually do we 're going to do our knowledge mint to country okay here is the land here is the sky here are my friends and here am I we thank the bindle and the wool Greg of our people for the land on which we live and play and we promise to care for it every single day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello song so you 're just gonna wave and it 's best you can wave to bub or it 's whatever that works best for you ok hi hello and how are you how are you how are you hi hello and how are you how are you today good job everyone ok so the next one we 're going to do is round and round the garden so these actions can be done on Bob 's belly or on the hands or in front of them with your hands if you want whatever helps to get their attention okay so first round and round the garden like a teddy bear one step two step tickle them under there I hope that put a smile on your bubs face okay so next is little Peter Rabbit so we can do the actions in front of both or you can do them on bub themselves whichever works best and they enjoy it so a little bit of rabbit will have a fly upon his nose and he will swish any or swash okay little Peter Rabbit had a fly upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose little Peter Rabbit had a fly upon his nose he switched to a nice wash to add way great job everyone okay so the next one we 're going to do is little five ducks so you can do that again with Bob or on in front whichever one works best so five little ducks went out one day over the hill and far away mama duck said quack quack quack quack but only four little ducks came back full two ducks went out one day over the hill and far away mother duck said quack quack quack but only three little ducks came back three little ducks went out one day over the hills and far away mama duck said quack quack quack quack but only two little ducks came back two little ducks went out one day over the hills and far away mama duck said quack quack quack quack but only one little

then we 'll put a diamond in the sky okay you ready twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are great job everyone okay so it is also a really good idea to slow down when you 're doing it I might have been going a bit faster so the slowing down helps the baby to understand the words you 're saying and it also helps them to learn those sounds as well so the more you say it the slower as well gives them a chance to understand and process them okay so the next song we 're going to be doing is to look at little Dicky Birds so you can use your hands or you can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to use my fingers to little Dicky Birds sitting on a wall one named Peter one named Paul fly away Peter fly away Paul come back Peter come back Paul good job everyone okay so keep in mind it is okay if you do get words wrong or if you can replace them and by the end of it the babes bubs or the children will know the words and they 'll be able to sing to you hopefully so it is okay if you do get them wrong just keep going okay so the next song we 're going to sing is row row row your boat so this one you can use row bar back and forth and you can rock them side to side or you can just use their arms and legs up to you okay so row row row your boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream rock rock rock your boat gently down the stream if you see a crocodile don 't forget to scream ah good job everyone so the next song we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do that up your arm in front of bub or you can go up its whatever helps to keep the bubs attention on you and you don 't have to go for the whole length it 's just to keep bub engaged okay Incy Wincy Spider pull it up the water spout down came the rain and washed poor Incy out out came the Sun and dried up all the rain Incy Wincy Spider crawled up the spout again good job everyone okay the next one we 're going to do is wheels on the bus so if you have any older kids as well you can get them to join in maybe have them in front of you that way everyone 's engaging as well and they 're having fun okay so we 're going to go the wheels on the going to go round and round then the horn on the bus is going to go beat beat then the people on the bus are going up and down so you can

going to lay them in the lap so you can actually move bub as well or you can move the bub and hands into their lap we 're then going to give them a shake and keep them wide awake and then we 're also

Australia",1100,[Music] hello I 'm Jonathan McBurney I 'm the creative director here at post Tucker regional gallery and pinnacles gallery you might notice this year that we 're holding the Percival 's just in per stucco regional gallery unfortunately after the monsoon event we 're still undergoing repairs over at pinnacles this year was actually our biggest year yet for entries we received over 300 entries which were very very happy with and we managed to cram in 239 of the shortlisted works up on the wall this this year I 've noticed a lot of interconnecting themes particularly there 's a lot of works by women this year I think something like two-thirds to three-quarters of the works are works by women which is very interesting also a lot of portraits of women by women so I think there are some very very interesting perspectives coming through I think good portraits set up in interesting ways a sort of complicated dynamic between viewers subjects and artists so all good portraits having them relationships between those three elements and I think for this work we have a very complicated relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one hand it 's a very vulnerable portrait thus it is very open and sitting in a languid pose so there 's there 's that but then we 're met with a face that has a quite a steely quite cut off expression and a hat of an elf so we we 're not quite sure if the portrait is sincere or at least if the subject is sincere if he 's friendly or if he 's sarcastic or what 's happening so my relationship as a viewer with this subject is strange and unsettled but the other side of that is that I felt that the artist that was being absolutely sincere so there 's great affection in the way that the paint is laid out a great affection between the artist and the sitter really resonated with me I think the work is technically incredibly masterful is an incredible sort of maturity and intelligence of choices in terms of the paint application the nuance of the colors a great variation in gestural marks very fine work with more expressive mark it 's basically a painting without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting that didn 't work that 's another very very sophisticated painting and particularly in terms of technique there 's a lot of high high realist work in the exhibition which is very impressive intellectually but that work straddles are really nice in-between spot between a sort of romantic human feeling way of painting and and high realism as well it similarly is a very sophisticated work strategy it has a palette quite similar to the winner actually but there it was a great comment I thought on the gap between our interior selves and our relationships with others so these women are on a bed preoccupied with themselves not really interested in us and then they 're also held inside a room which is separate from us and then held inside again by the yellow frame it 's just a very intelligent again painting with a great sensitivity of brushwork I was just really intrigued that I feel photograph sometimes only shows photographer and sometimes photographers have ideas concepts and that put them on their cities and they don 't let us say this to be cities they don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case even though it 's a very formal a very kind of symmetrical composition the gaze really straight at the camera I find that really really intriguing and I really went back all the time also it feels almost not real it feels almost like a stage and the fact that Janet used techniques to keep everything in focus so you do have foreground that 's very much in focus we do background that 's very much in focus it gives you actually I would say almost four different planes and it also allows you your eye to wander from one plane to the next and but it always leads you back to their gaze and because it is almost almost flat because of the sharpness of the image it 's almost really this Hagen Blake or this blink of an eye Hagen Blake has in german blink of an eye it 's and it really does this moment in time that really works for me so well so Glenn O 'Malley work was really one of the works that stood out for me and that really spoke to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the image was supposed to meet just perfect it 's one of those works that are not overly staged or they 're not overly you know studio photography or it feels like it just happens and it was really I think he caught some truth in all these people at this moment I found a composition really interesting you see actually a very almost pale vulnerable face staring Oh more insight because she 's looking outside the frame and she has got his calmness almost kind of them it looks almost like a meditation in the center of the actual image in front of this dark black background is this quite beautiful chicken you can see it as a connection between I think it 's a farm assistant and and the choke that she 's handling so it 's just this interconnection between those two that really I think comes through and I think that was very much what attracted me beside of that it is a very technically nicely resolved image Alyssa 's work is just incredible it really just jumped out at me the attention to detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know such a delicate little creature and how she 's portrayed it was just beautiful [Music] I really hope that everyone gets online and supports the awards because it 's just it 's just incredible there 's some amazing works not just the animal works but the photography and the portraits as well it 's been a really nice change for the Percival 's this year having both the painting and the photography exhibited side by side I think it 's given a very different perspective and a different view of what both painting and photography are and their relationship,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

QLD 4810, Australia",1387,I use coffee and tea here to give a really rich lovely under watch and so I 'm going to show you guys how to do that today so you can use things that you 've got laying around your house such as in your garage you can use anywhere it 's um paper to rub the surface of the of the of the paper and then when you put your wash on it 'll sit into that recessed area and create this little lovely texture another thing you can use or scissors or a paper clip and just scratch the surface of the paper when you put your wash on it sits into the recesses again and gives you this beautiful drawing like Mort making another one here is wet spray or mist down my daughter 's bedroom I tend to steal a lot of her stuff for my homework which I shouldn 't do and you just pop you wash on obviously where you put the wax it resists so you get this lovely under coming through and another one is using a cotton earbud put down your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas with the cotton buds again to give this nice more making and another way of doing it is to pop up quite a thick wash down first of or coffee you need it to be quite rich in deep so please don 't put a lot of water in there but that depends what texture and tone you 're after as well I took a little bit about that after and then if you get some rubbing alcohol or some whites and squeeze it onto the top it 'll separate and it gives you this beautiful water effect and then last but least another one is again popping your what your wash down and then spraying into it with a insect repellent mosquito spray and again that 'll separate and give a lovely watered effect so I 'm gonna run through some of these actually on a blank paper for you in a little while but I 'll just show you what I 've been working on so I 've used these techniques and yesterday I started to do a little bit of landscape work now here I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol to separate so that 's kind of like a water effect there now I 've used the scratching and the wax resistance and then just a nice wash of and herbal tea at the top just to give the white areas some some depth and then basically I 've just gone over the top of some wine work in them in pencil so yeah I really enjoy working on that and obviously you can build up your layers and your backgrounds and they can overlay with fine detail for tree effect or skylines and what I will be doing not in this workshop but probably the next one is teaching you all about toning and blending and using watercolor as well so we 'll go through some of these activities how to blend tone and shade and your artwork so they 'll be pretty good and and we 'll also concentrate again on texture in your watercolors again we 'll use salts rubbing alcohol or some paper so be critical and this is just going to show you what you can do the interesting coffee so you just wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gives you this beautiful spidered effects which is nice and again this is tissue dripping this heaps heaps of different techniques I 'm just going to focus on a few today so this for example is one of my little beachcombing series and you can see in the background I 've just basically wet it all with a teabag that 's all that that is a wet teabag and it gives a really beautiful earthy tone as you can see and these are just a couple more little ones that were experimenting on yesterday to show you and another one so we 've got tree lines we 've got foreground so it gives a really really lovely rich deep tone now obviously the way that I work in some of my bigger pictures I tensed a little sketches with lots of detailing and because I 'm an abstract expressionist artist I render the image down it 's something like this so I actually reduce and take out so it just gives the essence of the landscape just the foreground middle ground and skyline and I love dripping and splattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting so I do use these for my washes in my big paintings as well so yeah cool we 'll move up to the next stage oh pretty good great watercolor paper here nice and thick so first of all I want to do here is just half the ribbon alcohol you can see how it all separates there it gives it a really beautiful patina beautiful effect that 's lovely so that 's one layer pops on now I 'm going to use the I 've got quite heavy grit sandpaper here but not anything away it 's up to you whatever it 's not laying around if you can 't get to the shops remember this and wherever we 've got you can even use lemon juice to get this effect it will be a lot more subtle [Music] I can see applications from this top off there so I 'm going to using out some coffee this is quite nice you can see that creates a different you can see I 'm digging into the surface let 's get some texture in their appearance of trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful so it gives the impression of another layer of lung what shall we use maybe that 's usually what 's risen next for the next layer so this is just to give you an idea what you can do this isn 't going to be masterpieces just to show you what you can do this is the able T back here I think we might have a little bit of a pre-k now obviously there 's a little bit of grit on there because they spaz but when it 's dry it 'll just fluff up with your brush so what I like to do now is just to go in the fine detail different areas houses I mean you can wait for this lip layer to dry and then go in there to give it more depth next cetera I actually like to put Lots mouldy up but you can see the beautiful different textures here here in here creates the lovely effect and then when this is dry that 'll separate and you get the wax resin through and I 'll show you what a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just makes it really beautiful and again I like to just this one is I 've gone in there and drawn in little areas and obviously this is my technique as well as over the top of here but you can see that tea and coffees beautiful of spices then you can go in there and draw over it get more depth to it with watercolor pencils or ordinary pencil and just give the impression of the skyline you can work on this you can be working on three or four at one time I like to have four set up so guys I hope you 've got a little bit out of this workshop today just have a rummage through your pantry and see what you can get because look you 've got heaps of stuff here you can use tea coffee you don 't if you don 't have any brushes at home you can just use the tea bag you can improvise you can use cotton wool buds whatever you 've got laying around this really is a super accessible workshop [Music] you [Music],"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

QLD 4810, Australia",8805,hi everyone and welcome to our next episode of real good two sugars my name is Brittany I 'm your host for today and I 'm joined by Michaela and virtually joined by Sam and hey so doing things a little differently today for good old social distancing um hopefully it works out well so today 's topic is Harry Potter so we 're going to be discussing more thing Harry Potter are getting nice and magical up in here so we also have the answers to our trivia questions from last week 's show Doctor Who so we pop those ones up for you and we also will put them in the comment section so let us know how you went and put your answers in the comments below and we just wanted to let you know you can access all of the Harry Potter titles as ebooks for free with your library membership through our bio box app so if you have any questions about that feel free to give us a call or have a look at our website okay ladies we ready to get started yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and why my favorite character is Lupin he 's just so cute well such a hard life and he didn 't deserve it I know did you like did you cry when he died in the book so the movie and the books the movie sort of glossed over it you just sort of there was just like a pan or like a multitude of dead bodies and it was a lot to take in because you saw like the Weasley twins and then you know Thomson Lupin and yeah yeah I don 't like that they didn 't really touch on their child that lunch in the movies Thomson tell you he was that was and that was like a really big sort of character like arc for Lupin in the books because you know he sort of went through that crisis of wanting to be out in action and being scared about having a child who could carry the werewolf gene then it was like a big thing for him and they just completely got rid in the movies faces your face factor mine is wrong I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the most relatable character and I like his personal development through the story like you first see him and he 's just he isn 't very confident in himself that he doesn 't really I don 't want to say like he 's dumb because tonight is quite intelligent but he is a different type of intelligent to what Harry and Hermione are and I really feel that that he is like the the character that look for me anyway that you can relate to in more of a human way because he he shows that you 've jealous and shows prejudice against you no magical boat and stuff like that but throughout the series we seek and develop and start to accept his Worth and show his potential a bit more especially when he leaves and comes back in the last stone fork and it killed you like he destroyed the wall props and things like you know he 's found that personal power so I for me that that whole arc of heaven then you know in in light like kept talking to Hermione who 's there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intelligence but they just sort of on some level they kind of match each other if I weigh like you 're each other 's equals in some way so he 's my favorite and he 's Leslie just the comic relief I 'm like you 're such a dork he doesn 't really understand himself that much but I think growing up with the series as well I was able easily lately to Ron and not yeah yeah he 's my favorite saint of Ron in the movies is from couples are five wedding like when like the Himani comes in to fight to muffin ease just wearing is singling it 's like home funny how something like Oh fantastic uh yeah I really love bran and he 's trying to like break out of that like he 's got such a large family and it so you get lost in that sometimes like he always trying to break himself out from just being one of the Weasleys I think they did a really good job with bran I know there 's a few things that I um a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books that they didn 't put in the movies like during the Battle of Hogwarts where he went like cold money wanted to go save the house elves and stuff down in the kitchen like that was such a defining moment for me in the books where they that 's where they ended up having their first kiss yeah so yeah he 's I love and look look he was sort of like the black the voice of reason I guess like he sort of predicted a couple of things in the books that Harry and Hermione didn 't really think about and I didn 't yeah I feel like he really was able to that have the influence or especially on me where I 'm just like well I can I can connect with this character like I 'm not super smart like I can connect with my name is even very independent nor one but I had I stole my insecurities and my anxieties and all that through brawn and I was like accounting the world of harry potter through his eyes where you know he 's growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of what has the one year and not you know wet very much got sort of that Harry 's old is wealth a child who 's in a broken world and and I thought not not being able to experience life the way that one greed but yeah I just I really connected with America yeah the only ones like the trio grew up with magic sentiments like whatever it is Harry and Hermione oh my god the pages move yes and names like yeah I feel like yeah he was the most relate character in the sense that the most human he showed that even just beat himself he was essentially even though yeah I think Michaela here is your favorite character I would have to say Hermione I feel like I connected really well with Hermione just her ability to still be really like smart or intelligent but still being able to be really compassionate as well like the way that she tries to help Mike she always helped Neville all that wants to get more rights of the house elves they can just find that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that sort of yeah what Hermione is I feel like she never compromises himself for anybody yeah like to she knows who she is and she 's proud of the way how smart she is so like her kindness and everything she knows who she is fundamentally and like she never changes that for anyone anybody should not apologetic about it I really like that 's what I loved about Hermione growing up dude yes yeah yeah I ain 't a sztyc and I feel like Emma Watson was a fantastic Hermione I could never imagine anyone else playing Hermione like even though some things like there are a few bits and pieces but like I just yeah I look at the book book my knee and I see Emma Watson like I 'll see her forever as that yeah yeah my favorite Sirius Black any any time I 've had any like any mention of Sirius Black in anything is fantastic like I don 't know why I 'm so drawn to him he 's like the bad boy of the movie day but um I think yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had this connection with Buckbeak and he sacrificed like he sacrificed a lot in his life like he lost like his parents were horrible to him in a part of the world that he didn 't want to be a part of and then you know he found there 's a really deep connection with James and and then he lost all of that he lost pretty much everything when Voldemort killed James and Lily and he spent 13 years 12 years in Azkaban for something that he didn 't do and even though he does become free he never is truly free from from his past and from all of that like I remember in the books that I always felt really compassionate towards him when like they would talk about the scenes where he would you know go upstairs and spend a lot of time with Buckbeak because that 's like he 's the only person or only animal or thing that he sort of felt that connection with where they both can 't just go off into the world because it you know nobody wanted so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has so many qualities underneath him rather than just that like cool uncle vibe to him it 's really special and I really love anything to do with the mobile it is there their whole storyline and everything is just that 's all I ever want is a pretty cool about the Marauders that 's all I want in this world and it 's probably never gonna happen you get to play serious there 's mmm I remember like you know knock in the good old tumbler days they used to be you know people would make those things where they 'd have whoo that they would cast as young versions of people and there was always this one guy and I can 't remember what his name was but he does look like a young serious but I don 't know who I would have to play him don 't you need someone like brooding yeah brooding but with charm and that little bit of like fun in them self-deprecating you know oh no no that would be good oh yeah Oh fantastic um he 's everyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most we had a conversation together and I was very excited to hear sense reasoning why nothing I just probably disagree right now probably agree with you but I take issue with Dumbledore oh yeah I think he 's stupid problematically you know sleaze whatever you say and to dislike Evans couldn 't Harry you know it 's totally hard school like he was being raised and sacrificial and every find out but like I don 't know Abby didn 't say that he needed to be appearance to be conditioned so that we give to the people more like yeah that 's not forgivable then no no I might get everything and like the best parts we at the end carry bigots Dumbledore and understand fits with a great agreement and maybe because Harry could use Dumbledore way as opposed to as well but I 'm like no that was yeah that isn 't really and it seems like the only one who sort of like a grief that is snipe he 's like what the hell even their snake is like so mean to Harry and dislikes Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise him to kill him it 's you don 't really see that as a kid like I don 't I 've never really touched like thought about that when I was a kid that Oh Dumbledore 's just put him in a beautiful and it 's raising him to eventually die potentially stay dead no one really knows where the Harry would have come back from icarly career-high Green is that yeah then why this I 'm I 'm the same as you I was like really not paying attention to Dumbledore and character in ice upon it until really like the last books where he was kind of like um especially when he was completely ignoring Harry yeah and not acknowledging him when he really should have been and then I 'll sound like it yes cool but yeah I 've read that that 's it so he 's likeable because he is with this wise yeah it 's hard to be like wait a second me this comeback he had some troubling behavior he needs to go see a psychologist about that is it some internal things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shady yeah yeah feel like maybe that is supposed to make you real I can understand you know his sister he feels guilty due to that remove all in this I mean why did you not learn that 's really it was a lot of people say that I 've got a snake they 're like oh you know that 's not excusable because equal whose children like he 's just infatuated with Lillian consortium garage or wherever it is care about like Snoopy itself yes no fear oh I don 't know I 'm stuck I 'm torn between exactly that having equal characters and doing like a kind of obviously experience their own trauma that 's shaped how they 've progressed into adults but at the same time we get into into that sort of mindset hi Bri I am that 's actually a point yeah yeah what about you faith in you is there anyone else that you knew just like probably not as I think I think it 's safe to say everybody had umbrage but I 'm yeah food obviously I have but I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view the books I don 't really read them though are gonna dislike that character because I I sort of tried to look at it from that perspective where I 'm like I know why they 're doing that and yeah exactly not always character way is just he he sort of has like a Redemption at the end as well but he 's a total piece of work throughout the entire series where he just you just want a cocoon yeah and I don 't like Joffrey and getting free you want to dislike you and I did but I don 't think I really think that Jason really did a really good job of like finishing the oxen in that way and then you sort of feel it feels right to do it though so I can 't really dislike a character that much except the hungry I keep coming back about it she 's not so terrible there isn 't any ax I really like that too because it 's just one power to people who like she 's so yeah that 's fantastic I think see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movies and I love you me in the books I feel like they did a very great disservice to Ginny 's character like you know I like Bonnie and you know she was good to a degree when she was a kid but the way that they portrayed Harry and her storyline I was like this is so quick it 's like on par with that Voldemort Rhaegar that 's like so it screams to watch my transition between him in the movies anyway between him like lacking Cho and then all of a sudden it was like what did he just say like yes it will doesn 't connect nicely no I don 't think so and like Ginny was such like a firecracker character in the books and she 's so strong and you know really just probably the bravest out of all of the Weasleys wheezy children and I just feel like that didn 't it just didn 't come across and it made me dislike her in the movies and not be interested in those scenes where you know she 's in there they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just is so lacking it 's just she just lacks and that 's why I really like I really disliked that and I just can 't stand to watch those things anymore cuz it get frustrating it 's so bad yeah by my least-favorite it between umbrage and Snape like I just I feel like Snape 's redemption isn 't sort of enough like the way that he treats the children like he shouldn 't be a teacher just it 's full stop like I understand he 's had past traumas and all that but if we look at Neville like Neville he grows up and he 's still kind and all that even it with his past traumas like he gets bullied by Snape to the point where that 's his greatest fear yeah and so I just feel like Snape yeah would be my least favorite I love that comparison yeah yeah I love you I think even JK Rowling 's come out and said like you can 't excuse everything that Snape has done just because you know he was trying to be a good guy like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really terrible name and was a very horrible person and like I feel like he was just selfish like hey the only reason we 're doing it was because he loved Lily and really didn 't really want to yeah just happy with James and I 've seen something about that where the prophecy said that it was some people who were stood up to Voldemort three times sort of thing would then defeat him or whatever so there was at least two other times that the James in product James sorry James and Lily stood up to Baltimore and snake did nothing and so it was more maybe guilt that Snape had causing Lily 's death this is why he did all that yeah like he didn 't try and help her before that so I feel like yeah I 'll tell you what load that 's the scene of Alan Rickman like when he finds Lily dead upstairs in Deathly Hallows Oh even if he hates name maybe hate that whole story line I cry I was in tears he did such a fantastic job that just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detestable character and the reason so many people are like Oh snake is the quality if you like so much yes fantastic I loved it and what everyone 's favorite book and movie like which book is your favorite and then which movie is your favorite I 'm as always I 'm a sinner I 'm my I have to I really actually no you know what although I really enjoyed Britany recommend not my favorite for me though because it was for a lot of different reasons like the adventure Robert was so cool I remember reading enough they 're like time traveling and they 're gonna sing big and they 're gonna do it with some self but also at the same time like it just feeling growing up in that dev assignment as I am and they 've got I 'm going through and I just really feel like ones like that it 's the first real dead sleep rich story of where Harry starts to realize this seriousness of what 's actually going on like you have all of these lion stories you know he doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one but you know he 's like a real proper sweet I can you try and throughout the story of that and yeah it was just it was really cool going on on that sort of different adventure with with them and you know what that one was new flavor you eat I think yes i know i like how they went darker with the movie but i feel like they didn 't really sort of like a lot of stuff went to I 'm a little bit like they 're just kind of a change thing but I like that the doctor asked if the program yes but my favorite bill you know mostly because I think it 's because it 's like the final year of Watson you just kind of like this you know what 's going to happen after this and it 's just it adds up sort of element to it getting darker and darker yeah I just like that I just really like to say you marry not take it then liquid [Laughter] Mona donor one it 's funny but it is yeah yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenix oh just because I 'm like a spective like this is underground rebellion of kids teaching each other yeah and I loved the kind of like it into denial I guess that Voldemort was back and that I didn 't want to admit it and they were too scared to admit I love the way she did that I thought it was really clever again like I don 't like they really captured all of it yeah well it was the longest book and the shortest movie that they created it but I really like the shortest movie and I didn 't know yeah it 's the biggest book and the the shortest runtime for the Harry Potter movies which is very strong yeah he is interesting but epidemic quite like the first half on our tables newspaper you I want you I think it 's so cool you 've already said it I love that we get to spend like quiet time together that 's my favorite thing to be able to just watch the Harry and Hermione on that side and never listen internet again to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh yeah no I would do one that I really like the first one yeah it 's great I like and I just I really feel like the scene where Harry thinks it 's best to leave and then go and come down and I really love that sentance just like get it together with all Ron same boat here just because you 're the chosen one doesn 't make you any less of any more like special to be in but you know you can 't do this without us I just really I loved that scene from I loved um I loved that scene where Hermione 's teaching Ron how to play the piano when they 're in remote house ah so sweet and that 's when you 're really for me that was when I really started to feel that like that Ron and Hermione were actually feeling things for each other that really likes some intimate in that moment and plus I love the Nick and then it came in the Bad Seeds some that they play when home on Ian how are you dancing together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to any time I think about it makes me smile there 's something about it even though it 's like like they have that being sad again and it 's just that little brief glimpse of normal Izzy and happiness it 's um yeah really beautiful my favorite book is person her best man and my favorite movie Prisoner of Azkaban I loved it I loved it and I think it just goes back to I loved seeing that glimpse of Harry 's parents lives and it is really that 's hurting point of like I know Goblet of Fire is quite dark but this is sort of where Harry figures out who he is starts to feel a bit more of a connection to his parents and to his past and he holds on to I feel like he holds on to that for the rest series and it 's something that you know keeps him going and then now he knows that he has serious there as his Godfather he just feels a bit more supported right before he gets thrown into all of the crap that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a sucker for and I 'm like the animal characters in any movies and Buffy is one of my favorites like even though he 's a you know a Griffin it 's like I still like you I still love you well then I like some of these other characters I would die for you you know I like that it 's like you know that love you have for your own animals it 's like I project that onto these creatures um and plus I loved the school for the third baby like the music Florence just completed that whole experience for me like I love I love all the music and Harry Potter especially in the two Deathly Hallows movies they had really great music but the third one really cemented me as I was growing up to like that type of classical like movie school music it gave me a bit of a connection so I always loved going back to going back to that what about you yeah so I 've only just recently read the series like for the first time so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really cool to see the book side of it because obviously like the books are usually always better so it 's really cool to see like what they 've missed out on in the movies um to compare it so I found that the first three books was very similar to the movies like obviously they left out things but I found that the Goblet of Fire was the most different so far like that 's the one I 've read up to so yeah so Goblet of Fire book would be my favorite just because of the difference they like they 've got so much more than the previous books compared to the movies so yeah that would be my favorite book oh and the I 'm not sure it 'd probably be the first two just for how similar that they are to the books like I feel like they 've done them really well compared to the rest so far see ya what Sam em what 's everyone 's saddest moments in the series anything what is like when you first think you think of this scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sad like you made cry emotes mine is um it 's not in the movies but it 's in the book it 's in Deathly Hallows where Harry and Hermione at the parents graves in Godric 's Hollow and the wording that she that JK puts in it is like Harry is standing over his parents graves and for the first time he want he wishes that he was underneath there and he had died with them so he could be resting peacefully with his parents and you know not having to deal with everything that 's going on in being the chosen one just the wording for it was like hit me even as a kid I think I was maybe 12 or something at the time when Deathly Hallows had actually come out and even as a kid it was like the most profound thing I had ever read and every time I see it it makes me cry and then obviously they 'll be dying in there that 's uh that 's a bad that 's traumatic yeah mine isn 't beeps I spot I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cedric degrees bori be attached to his father gets me very badly because their family has never like they don 't like Harry they don 't have this sort of constant danger and they 're so happy and you know Cedric 's like the golden boy and his father is far out unit and I swear as it 's the first time we see that it 's he doesn 't just carry in both walk up until then the stories behind it exactly that he found killed him in the child we know that he did terrible things but it went distant from it Andrea 's and then we see this turn Levi really never did anything wrong I mean he 's an ordinary guy living his life super happy eight things live in him and he 's just like this live stand-up victim and for the best time I like wow people are going to be killed for no reason other than that just they 're in the way yeah and they 're not involved and see what that do you consider his father I mean Inc doesn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the character we particularly have any connection to I think that 's why it got even he 's outside the circle news yeah yeah yeah yeah that same way secrex tab is crying yeah oh sorry wrong that like and you don 't think about it as a kid like you you know it 's sad but and it 's real hot break and there 's going to be so much more of that that 's the movies and books progressed on but yeah I love that scene I can see why that is yours i I have got to I have but like just keep on pushing what 's he made me cry it 's not really sad but it was in the movies at the end of the first movie where high group use carry the photo album I was terrible opens it and he sees humans baby with his parents and then just the shot of of the big dude of Daniel and has tears in his eyes and I was like a certain little idiot ur preciously funny and this is like the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can be like it he 's just he 's just so grateful you can just see it in that moment that made me cry I think someone but I right now it 's just so cute innocent and it 's so just like in the moment and then I 'm just like oh that was gonna go back to the Dudley 's anyway um but they 're saying that really that it 's really sad to me when he 's going to into the forest and he uses the definitely ecstatic and then he sees the ones that we came and I 'm and he 's like with me like I eaten Octus you know I get this totally just in the very Sun full of what story has been building to and you just you know that his the people that care about them you know so they wanted to be with him the entire time I 've got a walk through the cards and you know that 's just it 's really it 's so pure that just didn 't it 's just she really did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything now that 's probably the saddest you know we go eat it died and I found um yeah doggies zombies death was really hard like the way he died I feel like that was really no it 's not nice but it 's a good point for his character sort of seemed like he was always a fan and grateful for what Harry did and so he was there to save him and then the way that Dana Ratcliffe portrayed Harriers that like dealing with that death was really heartbreaking cry every time I watch that so yeah don 't be stir like it was really sweet I think the thing that it was like when he dining is like it 's good to be here with a friend or something like right before it cost us away and I think that cements them as like equals like Harry and Ian Dobby is equals because Tommy 's been there for ever since you know the second movie and you know has had some pretty important roles and stuff so yeah that always gets me so bad as they start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything he lies a free elf Dobby oh man not right it 's heartbreaking I think another sad moment too is it 's like sound good and sort of touches on what you said faith is when in chamber of secrets which one we 're out and you know in the book run I 'm in the movie in book run can see himself being like house boy and you know it 's like champion of Quidditch and everything and all Harry sees is two parents behind you might clean their hand on his shoulder and that 's all they ever want and I love that like we start with that and then it comes to the culmination of that scene where he 's with his family and there with him there at the end not in the way that he would want them to be but you know he he does have that family there with him when he needs it so sweet I 'm not bit breaks my heart okay well let 's get out of all of this sadness can we do a sorting hat ceremony so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters from both movies and with open book so we 've been our sorting out there with Sam and faith as well I 'm so first off we 've got you know Hufflepuff Gryffindor so they 're in a ravenclaw we might sort a Natasha Romanoff verso Black Widow from Marvel if you 're not familiar with her name where do you reckon she would go I personally think her third door yeah she 's complicated but deep down she is quite brave and loyal I think somebody 's around her like as we see an endgame and yeah I think this justifies in it okay yeah yeah I think I mean she 's done some questionable things but you know haven 't we all I think that yeah great all the time yes can 't rubric is us everyone agrees Gryffindor for ChaCha yeah yeah yeah alrighty let 's pop it in what about Han Solo I reckon Slytherin so because he 's bad but cuz he 's funny yet so do I feeling ambitious just smooth talker aren 't they putting out the number one minute he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in force awakens where he 's when he 's like putting money off all of these different gangs in the universe isn 't it he spent all the money and haven 't delivered on what he is supposed to deliver on and they all come after him in he 's like fantastic so next one what about Peter Parker so quite a man hufflepuff yeah definitely loyal I feel like oh ah yeah I don 't know yeah I know I really just thank you yeah I 'm gonna say hufflepuff you 've just really even though he is brave and he 's loyal and all that but I just it 's just not true it 's just fun and news accepting of everyone yes let 's go from optimism yeah [Music] even when he was able to find humor in the situation and it 's just you know self listens like the qualities I do wrong right there so underrated hmm they really are and I think that 's not really something I noticed when I was growing up is really not all that much like information on Hufflepuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cedric and then he dies like we don 't really have that in the near the kitchen like [Laughter] lucky that I would be a Hufflepuff just for that right everyday that would be defense oh that 's so good hanging out with a little elves they 'll be fantastic all right we 'll put it in a Hufflepuff I reckon oh yeah yeah Pope Peter Parker in Hufflepuff I reckon if it was Tobey Maguire one I reckon he would be in raven cool because he just has a raven cold why beat me but pita pita pocket Tom Hollands it is a total pop I can have you know even told me it 's like two minutes of tumble and being uh-huh it always refers to himself as a grouping dog oh honey you don 't know yourself you 're wrong yeah okay um Bilbo Baggins this one 's a bit different yes I feel like he 's a mixture between a Gryffindor and a Hufflepuff yeah mm-hmm like he 's brave like he you know breaks the mold of the hobbits and goes out and goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homely he loves his only comforts and he has that sort of kind caring qualities about him where even though someone you know talks bad about him or does something to him he still shows compassion you know like Colin 's like in a treatment he 'd probably be a Hufflepuff but among hobbits he 's probably they are like that that 's a good explain but they are big them all right let 's pull him in Gryffindor we didn 't have any raven clothes so maybe Jane Eyre now I 'm not gonna lie yeah I know blasphemy I feel like there 's gonna be the defining moment here for Jane Eyre and just the deciding factor what are you record just from like what I sort of know I feel like she would be a raven core but maybe I 'm wrong she 'd be really doesn 't realize the diverse depart like it when she is real find out how to put her in turns and it 's a logic behind it who said that I understand why I 'm a raving cause I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the like qualities that you think each thing is like the cliche want to do yeah yeah yeah and the calm and I 'm not I 'd I don 't think with my head what can 't you do yeah I 'm very anxious so I don 't understand all right um Luke Skywalker Griffin Gryffindor straight away does he have a bit of odd I don 't think he has much company name has been in a dumb little boy oh my god he doesn 't hurt anyone huh yeah the griffon poppy there yeah I can put him in I 'll put him in the middle he is half and huh yeah but he is very eager and he 's very keen and he 's very bright but he 'll say no I mean I 'll be talking Luke Skywalker in OT oh yeah I feel like maybe in the originals coz I don 't like to discuss oh that 's gonna be fun yeah no I reckon here yeah I think I feel like he 's in between I can 't decide mr. Lucey pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see yeah something like that Nonya loosely from Romeo line which in the wardrobe the little girl you haven 't seen the movies or at all that 's a movie first one one by James McAvoy ha ha ha I can 't remember what he called me like a half ago mr. Thomas behalf go my sister 's gonna hate me saying this but like the girl who plays young Lucy in Narnia like looked exactly like my sister like to a tee when she was a child she was just hate it um but I feel like well I guess if you guys don 't really know I feel like she 'd probably be a raven cool she 's quite fun I feel like she 's a Hufflepuff you reckon yeah because she 's very accepting of everyone yes oh she 's the best sibling out of all of the ceilings in Narnia yeah she 's the kind compassionate one that first goes into Narnia and becomes friends with mr. Thomas and helps them to regain their Kingdom back and I can 't remember the Lions name but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the leader of Narnia until the witch queen ice cream come along attentive of stone yeah I definitely think a Hufflepuff though ok I 'll put her in Hufflepuff because I feel like we have better thority oh okay and I 'm saying I 'm not sure if you 're a Doctor Who fan but we 've got Amy Pond as the last one I feel like she 's halfway between Gryffindor and Slytherin because she is very cunning and she can think her way out of situations but she 's also like if she 's quite brave and she doesn 't look like raven core qualities matter as well so she 's he 's a Griffin cool you reckon yeah cuz the right hand no I think she 's she 's very brave like she in all aspect not just you know going on an adventure in facing danger but she also was really brave in in her result that the doctor was real and she wasn 't gonna let gold not she bit like all of the therapist what is it sure you know not she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you everybody just oiled especially to Rory yeah she 's she loves she loves them in different ways but yeah I would say she 's really good yeah now that you 've now that you like have touched on that loyalty aspect she is definitely I gotta put her in touch until now you would absolutely you know do anything for either of them yeah point point I mean she 'd be better Rory but like yeah there is a giant aspect that worlds in there that I 've been places for criminal yeah that 's my thing Oh Ronnie that 's our last person to saw it it looks like Gryffindor is criminal wins yeah that was right the doors basic your basic anger because what are you Seri one day I mean professor sprout wasn 't cheating I will be on a house yeah Oh what 's her name of a girl Miriam oh she she 's a legend she is amazing I love the story it 's just some casual just this happened and I 'm gonna shake [Laughter] so which what houses is everyone Sam your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then faith you and I are both brave and coolers hey oh and then what were younger if Endora Glenny Gryffindor always won I like that right and Cloris a majority here I never thought of myself as a raven cool yeah yeah now so does rating yeah maybe it 's just because it 's such an unknown area like your mom 's a Hufflepuff I 'd be a lot cool I 'm down with that but right Recor I 'm like this feels I feel like a fraud oh well that 's a current that 's alright okay let 's carry on to our third question um okay I like this I love this one if you could take one magical item from the Wizarding World what would it be so something like you know what a one I want that works and I can use so not Ron 's London 5th Chamber of Secrets that makes a neat slugs I love that I love that scene is invisibility oh yeah they want the time Turner would I feel like a time town it would just call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more read Macbeth travel permit yes yeah oh you don 't mind it bringing already more than one city I know it 's like the moisture it is the most random story line ever but like when you actually see it as the play it 's fantastic like I went and saw it when I was in London and like I haven 't been a had a bit of like reservations about this because I put in the where o is the years and I want you to know I think yeah because people reading it out of context so Mike what do you think yeah but do you like the play because it 's the production value or the story for the production value but it benefits the story like it you know you you 're you don 't have that like what the hell aspect when you 're actually watching the play it puts it all sort of together where you like oh yeah I could see this as a potential storyline but yeah reading it it 's like it doesn 't even feel like a JK Rowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I I like chicken ODF characters like in the future and like that children and stuff like that in it so it picks up on that law see definitely Hellinger they could be going on the train but yeah it just feels wrong I like to do it feels wrong I 'm so conflicted but do you like that appeal oh now don 't be not an insult because there is we 've been picking up yeah but like I 'm not going to ditch anybody Yeah right you 're not rock paper should do it will print like you would saying it 's like people have like intimately really cool stories oh yeah it 's one of them it makes me sad that it 's actually fun of you and I really feel like if I list it going through the show I have some chip my opinion is already solidified that I would be able to change it yeah yeah anyway I totally see the comment section in a different direction buddy close noted it pretty quick because I 'm like okay like I might just sneak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people planes and holidays I feel like if I had the invisibility like I would like just go to a restaurant or somewhere and just like sit and be pretty would have any one thing like you know like they look like a pile of chips on it just in my hand in that very quickly one oh I would probably want something that relates the animals like the magical creatures I don 't know I like the owl service I really like multi ourselves okay such a hard thing because like obviously everything that you probably want to do stamps from having a wand yeah it 's like I 101 but I want to do a little this cool stuff yeah I would say look I 'm gonna say that I would like to steal bumpy but I 'm him one thing it would be bumpy because one I love you okay idea what you fly and I wouldn 't have to worry about rhyme you never again cook I 'll painful fuel yeah FedEx to feed one transportation like a horse bit more I have to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place yeah hmm either a one and now that works like the out service or bursting but then you have to like the other care for it because it 's like it gets struck by lightning on something called bad weather it 's hard to control yeah you imagine if we actually had like Quidditch games like we 're like fish games so if we do in real life I feel like you need some stuff I 'm actual like I don 't know how they do it they might like strap daily brooms on and they play like Cleveland professional footage very straight that 's not cool yeah yeah it should we 're okay I know that there was one when I lived in Sydney they would like a little one yeah yeah I didn 't have it when I was at uni and Brisbane they used to have like a Quidditch team at my new he very strange I 've never seen did you gonna see a game I kind of Majid like being in spectator about 30 seconds later dress up is you know outfits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of sitting there watching this little miniature version of Quidditch you do you what could be everyone 's favorite subject at both wars mine would be a history of magic yeah I love history anyway but I would love to like learn all about visiting whole life then mom would be that all patient that just seems fun but mostly it is true energy just yeah it 's just it just if you find it you 're stirring stuff yeah what about you Sam oh I ordered I feel like Transfiguration yeah I 'm

In",u6USau6ZHSE,20200428,599.26,"Townsville QLD 4810, Australia",1112,the works in this collection works for my personal collection which I have put aside over the years many years and I felt it was time to get them out there so the public could have a look you [Music] [Music] [Music] since 1970 which is when I first went to art school in Adelaide the world has changed immensely in the art world has changed beyond recognition by of course in 50 years I have changed dramatically hopefully I 've grown I 've included the study for magic road which is a gouache on paper and you see the main major work which has a figure in which actually is a self-portrait it 's that 's just the general way I work I work with a scene that I find has a powerful feeling to it or light and as I 'm working I usually imagine what sort of character might be in that scene and so magic road is really a typical example of how I transform a study into a major painting I I do paint above quite a wide range of scenes because I do tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a curse as well as a blessing but um I my eyes get very used to us as a scene very quickly and they want to move on I like to see things fresh just like I turned the corner and saw it for the first time as far as a favorite place to paint or I love a really good ocean location I love the feel of the ocean and the ocean draws me in many times to paint it the road does appear in my paintings many times and that 's because I have just kept moving not that I want to is I 'm just compelled to move and I am it 's like a disease I don 't want to keep moving something forces me to and one day and it would be a lot more based in one place that 's one that is my dream regarding the vanquishes I 'm always conscious of guiding the viewer through the painting which increases or enhances the story so there 'll be a foreground element and then hopefully the eye is led back through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote we 're talking about the artist and model relationship and yeah that is important I mean a lot of models will enjoy the process of being painted there if they find it quite meditative and relaxing and that is they find it quite fascinating to see themselves portrayed in in paint or draw drawn and you know all of that adds into the energy of the painting usually I direct I know what I want so I usually am directing the model occasionally there will be some suggestions and and but you know might be far less frequently because I usually know what I want and models are very important to have a good relationship with them [Music] photography is a tool for my painting my initial response is to the actual scene which I paint on on-site and to the actual person which I think in my studio I will use photographs as a backup tool not as the main element to create a painting [Music] the model in the evening is suddenly the viewer is inside of story and they have to figure out what the keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the evening or the end of the evening [Music] when I started painting I never have a fixed story for example the popular girls it was based on the fact that particularly girls have this whole world based around the popular girls so I I started that however the narrative kind of spins into another world and there is no actual end story to that well I always work with music whether I 'm if I 'm working on-site I 'll have my headphones on and the whole music genre changes a lot compared to the what I feel at the time and in the studio I have music playing all the time as well I 'm not sure the paintings contain the music hopefully there is some element of that but that 's something I can 't really say it 's up to the viewer music years a huge part of my life and I when I paint to relax myself and to lose myself of my worries I put music on and the music covers most genres heavy metal a couple of others [Music] [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a film at the movies not at home at least once a week because I love the you know there you have a myriad of camera angles and street scenes and lighting effects which sparked my imagination I am influenced by movie stills and movies of course but I create from scratch from where I 'm at with with people who I know these scenes they 're all places I 've lived and they 're all people I know I I love art history I have an organic relationship to history however I 'm not a scholar I just respond to what what speaks to me whether it be Caravaggio it would hover or Alex Katz and I absorb as much as I can [Music] the way I paint the industrialized world I guess it 's something which I share with other figurative artists realist artists of course and there is a beauty in it okay Rick amore Jeffrey smart a paintings from Eagan

glad to see other people love it as well heads and shoulders is next now we do this one sometimes in Todd the time as well so I always get myself mixed up with the rhythm of this song this one 's a bit more calm or a bit more slower which really suits babies we need to talk and sing slow with our baby so they can hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we talk too fast they 're not going to understand what we 're saying and they 're not going to take it in in the interaction as we 're wanting them to so nice and slow always let baby see your face if you can as well okay nice and slow with this one heads

Director of Planning pleased to give you an update so through the chair the adjoining neighbors lodged an appeal through the court process questioning the lawfulness of the current activities on site

director council yes they had an original approval from 1993 the previous Theron Gow and the applicant is considering that that was an unlawful approval mm-hmm yeah through the chair yeah when I was reading it I was sort of they were just saying caravan park now I think there 's two sections to this caravan park I believe this is the big fall care of impact it had nothing to do his objection had nothing to do with caravan park proper you know where the residents and people go to now did it you know through this year through I 'll ask the director to provide you with the information yes through the chair the appeal in the courts at the moment we need to actually understand the clarity in relation to what they 're appealing Inez they 're actually appealing the the whole development is unlawful at this point in time that 's going to be mediated through discuss with the mediation process and hopefully you can get to a mediated outcome on a councilors pretty confident relation to the approvals it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can maintain its position between in relation to the previous approvals provided previously you thank you thank you we have a mover and seconder for the committee report to be adopted by council I 'd like to now put that to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you counselors I 'd now like to move to community and cultural development committee could I ask Council a door please to present her committee report madam chair I wish to present the community and cultural development report from Wednesday the 13th of November I wish to present item six three to ten contained within pages six through to ten of the ordinary meeting agenda for adoption Thank You councillor door do I have a seconder please council greenie thank you very much please tear through the check 9 subscriber to comment on item number 7 yes which is in relation to the art strategy at the committee the committee recommended several amendments being undertaken to this read read as part of the review of that document council offices undertook a further review and looked at the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councilors in investor councils have recommended that item to sort of theme to which previously read it as councils that producer be a mentor to council as a creator mm-hmm theme 3 which previously read a council as a supporter be changed to councillors champion and theme for which previously read as councilors cultivator be amended to council as an advocate those themes as amended better reflect the strategy and the outcomes it 's trying to achieve I remember that discussion thank you very much mr. director and there was also my Merrill message I believe has been amended to reflect a number of things in that strategy counselors counselor dog do you have a comment I do madam man madam mayor it 's very pleasing to present counsel for to Council for approval yet strategy for 2020 to 2024 this is the first time that our Performing and visual arts team to preserve presented a combined strategy and this is a direct result of the changes within our management structure bringing the visual and performing arts teams together with this combined document the team is therefore strengthened the focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the individual needs within each area a combined voice is a stronger one madam Eretz also pleasing and I 'm note that the director is highlighted at NU yourself to see that you requested an even stronger focus on advocating on behalf of our potential and emerging artists both visual and performing so if the last cohort of the visual artists graduating from jcu and TAFE endeavoring to fill this void it 's essential to advocate for this vital industry and voice our concerns for the futures of our arts community Thank You counselors so the amendments to the strategy were made after brisk debate within the committee forum and councillor door rightly points out that the the decline in the course availability in North Queensland northern Australia may very well lead to us losing very many talented people who could be working here in areas such as graphic design written written communication moving to southern capitals because there are no courses counselor door we know that TAFE is running some courses or looking to run some but there is a real problem for us in terms of trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain organisations like North Queensland opera musical theatre choral society [Music] just our own gallery staff people who creatives who are important around advertising local advertising photography the list goes on and on well if we wish to maintain the caliber of staff that we have now it 's important that we support their development from you know finishing their secondary through to the tertiary and you know people like Jonathan Burnie yes so counselors that 's why the changes to the strategy was important to reflect the concerns that we really have for North Queensland all right are there any other items that weren 't discussion just got discussion councillor Doyle thank you do any of the other councillors wish to speak on any of the items listed yes councillor coup I think you met a man I would just like to add to what council I had to say this is not arts for art 's sake this is literally arts for growing retaining and attracting smart people to our community any vibrant city will always have an alive and active arts community and that 's I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to all of the staff for supporting us to enact this strategy and I 'm very excited to see it happen thank you Thank You councillor any other discussions on any of the items listed we have a mover and seconder so we will put that Committee report for adoption to council all those in favor against

really want to see what understand what councils doing this report will be placed on our web and as part of our dashboard I strongly urge the community to see some of the work we 're doing around the Horten pipeline our Cleveland Bay purification plant reuse scheme the funding was spending on the Trebek pool our resources and wastes the cost to the community of those projects as well as some of the little things around information technology this organization could not function without having a strong back of house and things like information technology councils I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of things that we note we are behind on and I really want the community to understand that as a result of the monsoonal event and the floods our staff have had to manage that event the recovery process and still try and conduct business as usual and it 's been a difficult time in trying to deliver for our community and I can only ask that when they do go through this report that they are understand that and they are patient recovery will take us probably close to two years by rights and it 's a difficult time I know for many in the community they want to see things particularly around around the event fixed now sadly there is a process we do have to follow we 've literally had staff divided between recovery and BAU and it 's only in the last month or two that I can say to most of you that many of our staff have gone back to BAU but recovery is still forefront in our minds so it 's just a comment I wish to make and to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon but please be patient thank

we there they 're terminating that contract early it come February 2020 we 've causes being on the town 's a weekly social calendar for the past thirty odd years and the current contractor has held the last two and a half the markets are important economic driver for the CBD businesses and we would like to propose that we release an expression of interest to engage a new manager on a short-term contract through to the end of the financial year 2020 this would be this time to undergo a thorough review of the markets and their operation at the moment and and take out what we see is the next direction for the markets the markets could continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the road closure and some marketing assistance we would like to see the new management in this role focus more on fresh

questions of what 's proposed Thank You council Walker yes madam mayor I hear that it 's looking at a time so on the same day and I think we need to go a bit wider in relation to looking at how this sort of product could be offered in different different days different times leaving it open to those that are very dynamic in thinking on how we can move forward I think we caught up on the same Sunday morning sort of scenario I thought keep an open mind on those ones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think our towns elites is demonstrated that we as a team and with some smart people future cities and and throughout the counts that have done a great job for towns elites and that shows Friday night trading it has done exceptionally well I think we need to look at every option as a team and let our creative minds have looked at with an open an open canvas at clean canvas to see what we can come up with moving forward madam mayor and it could give us some more simulation and activation in certain areas in food and entertainment as well thank you any comments from I would ask is that will ensure that the expression of interest to make submissions based on what they believe would work best and the evaluation team will process them based on that think you see I think it 's you Thank You councillor any other comments if not then we will with those comments taken aboard by staff the recommendation is council calls the council supports the call for tenders to undertake the management of Coty 's market for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accordingly Thank You councillor Walker

council city council I 'd like to take a moment to honor the life of Ralph Martin he passed away on Friday the 1st of November Ralph with the lover of the Arts and played a critical role in helping support and develop what we now recognize as one of the most vibrant aspects of our community opening Ralph Martin gallery in 1972 on Flinders Street marked a shift in the remained until the inauguration of the post Tucker Regional Gallery in 1981 Ralph was instrumental in nurturing and growing arts commute the arts community during these intervening years showing local artists and bringing in blue-chip outside exhibition in essence helping to forge this community by the time sucker was opened Townsville had a ready-made community of artists of the highest caliber allowing Townsville a head start on a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed ever since without ralph Townsville would have been a completely different place now while the gallery closed in 1988 Roth continued to support the arts through purchases patronage and donations and only months ago Ralph 's donated an exquisite suite of itching to the council City Council art collection and works for the JC u special collection in 2016 purse Tucker regional gallery hosted and rightly so an exhibition celebrating Ralph 's legacy curated by Anika Silva a Martyn gallery alumnus under the gallery team will make a second print run of this again deservedly sought after publication in Ralph 's honor I on behalf of the council and the gallery services team would like to offer my sincere condolences to Ralph 's family and friends on the loss of this extraordinary and generous man Ralph 's rich legacy will continue to live on in our city 's galleries and artists and his memory in those who knew him and loved him I want to add one more point and just to make further comment that a city focused just on raids wrote some rubbish alone after what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You councillor Doyle and and I 'm sure Ralph would be very proud of the art strategy you brought to Council today is there any other general business councillor Walker thank you madam mayor just in relation to me attending in Brisbane

accordingly seconded councillor Walker thank you I will put that to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously could I please ask if there are persons out there who wish to be allowed to come in as long as we maintain social distance true public will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just see I 'll just wait to see if there are any members out there because a number were advised that this meeting would be made so that a man Rhonda checked and she said no one 's out there just right there are no persons out there all right counselors on 18th of March 2020 the governor-general of Australia declared a human biosecurity emergency in response to the covert 19 outbreak this council recognizes the Townsville residents and businesses are suffering significant economic distress because of measures adopted in response to the corona virus pandemic what we 're proposing today is as a part of our hardship relief policy that is part of our budget that we adopt a change to that package to assist Townsville community through this period or now like to ask the CI please to explain the report thank you madam me as you said the government general declared a given biosecurity emergency and we have seen over the last three to four weeks a consistently changing environment is having a major impact both economically but more importantly from a health community the organization in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was inherent and the responsibility of this organization to prepare as much as possible a package that will support the community during this period of time the initial paper that 's before you the initial paper that 's before you madam mayor speaks about the next three-month period that 's until the end of June 2020 however can I make it clear that it is stipulated that that will be reviewed in June at the end of June 2020 with of view to either extending or continuing the waivers and deferments that are in this paper again to continue to offer some type of respite to the community during this period of time the ability to run this meeting has been cleared but the Director General of the Department of Local Government madam mayor so that it 's clear to all members of the community delivers a duly meeting of councilors to pass this resolution the types of hardship relief packages that we 're referring to will come to a value of two point two nine million dollars and that is all a part of the hardship relief buckets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charges deferment and that 's the next tranche of rates and charges fall outside of the summation of frequent periods and deferral of rates and charges for a period of three months from August next year and that will continue to be reviewed as the circumstances are saying it is a clear waiver of fees and charges and that includes food licenses and there will be pro rata credit on already paid fees to the value of 100,000 the new hire will be waived ticket sales in all our venues refunds will be provided for any member of the community to purchase tickets to those vineyards CBD parking will be free parking for the hours that are stipulated on the sides I think it 's important madam mayor that everyone recognizes that we will still require community members to abide by the signage from an owl 's point of view however there will be no fee for those periods of time all commercial leases for properties that include community groups childcare centers entertainment and dining venues retail business swimming pools and tourism operators will be waived for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed in June 2020 I present this paper to the council for resolution and they donate Thank You counselors at the moment we are living in and I know people have used this term uncertain times the corona virus pandemic has meant that we 've seen particularly in the last week significant significant actions taken by the federal government in terms of trying to prevent the spread of the virus throughout our community in doing that it is having significant economic impact on a vast majority of our local businesses last week looking at what the federal government had foreshadowed it would do I asked the CEO and the executive to put together a list of packages that we can roll out depending on what the federal government and in turn the state government do as a way of social isolating and reducing the risk of transmission of the virus the CEO has done that with this first stage of [Music] proposals we don 't know how long this is going to last we don 't know how badly this community will be affected it truly is uncharted territory but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff to provide a list of projects that we could implement very quickly to restart and recharge our economy when it is safe to do so when we get the clearance from both the state and federal governments to be able to do something so while we are trying to provide relief for our community we will also be lobbying behind the scenes to encourage the state and federal we are in caretaker mode and this is the most we can do at this point in time our community is crying out for guidance and for leadership and until until the end of this month we are still a lot duly elected officials we have a responsibility to our community we 're not going to shrug that responsibility and today I hope you will support these recommendations this resolution so that we can give the community some hope that we are able to provide them with relief as we move through this situation I fully support this this package and duly move the document the resolution that is part of this report do I have a seconder Thank You council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thank you I just want to check whether the counselors want some clarity in the resolution I note that the resolution talks about the due date and discount rates for payments of rates and charges is there an appetite for counselors if we were to change to change in that first line and waist and place waist and utilities charges there to make it clearer to the public paragraph one first line I was going to to seek that we changed that to that the due date and discount date for payments of rates and wasting utility charges be deferred I 'd be happy to second that minimum that amendment all right so I 'll move the amendment seconded by Councillor qu any any comment we 'll put that up so on that first line the due date on paraone that the due date and discount date for payments of rates and waste and utility charges because remember our water and our wastewater part of our utilities right yes that might be more appropriate rights come out waste and utility charges thank you okay yes counselor door I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be grateful if both the CEO in particular could stress that this caretaking Council is doing everything that it can right now and given the circumstances that we find ourselves in because I know that there will potentially be questions why haven 't we done more oh there will be questions from people why are we doing this and I would love you to give me that you know clarity around the fact that we are doing what we can right now Turan undertaking from any council moving forward whoever sits at this table will consider greater measures I would hope that whoever sits at this table after the end of March will work constructively to try and ensure that we get our community through this as as best we can particularly if I have a responsibility to ensure that the actions that we 're taking and just appropriate but in fact illegal irresponsible that clarity was received at the Department of Local Government and I 'm comfortable that the process is the appropriate process under the circumstances it has been made more difficult by the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an occurrence that all seventy-seven councils are going through as we speak in relation to the resolution that you 're all voting on the clarity that was required was our ability or the councilors ability to vote on a resolution as opposed to a major policy decision there is no doubt in my mind that the people seated around this table the counselor table and the organization even know it 's been in caretaker mode have been working hard to ensure that we do what we can whilst being fiscally responsible recognizing the fact that the majority of our concerns are centered around supporting the community whilst maintaining and ensuring the safety of our staff and personnel as well so I thank the councillors for coming together during this difficult time to vote on this resolution hopefully that satisfies your reply well thank you see I just think it can 't be stressed enough in that such are in that sense given the circumstances that we do all find ourselves in correct all right so I haven 't formalized the amendment so we had a mover and seconder all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion the resolution ladies and gentlemen we are in extraordinary times at the moment I will put the resolution the resolution to the vote all those in favor against carriage unanimously councillors thank you for your time today it 's it 's difficult at the moment and I know it 's very difficult for many of our residents out there if we I will now adjourn not a journal will close this meeting at 23 approximately and I thank you for your attendance

there 's any questions also have stop Enders that might answers any questions councillors might have this item is regarding council put out a survey in relation to activating Ross River Dam in terms of potential recreational and commercial uses on the Ross River Dam and its catchment during a community engagement process which was undertaken on between for about a month between the 10th of October and the 13th of November council receives some of the order of about 1700 submissions sorry 1700 people visited the website in relations that have your say Townsville platform 318 people completed the survey that was provided online during that process 137 people also viewed the interactive map which is available online and 18 people posted or pin their comments online as well the report regarding the survey and the assessment of those seeking counsel to note the recommendations sorry the findings of the Ross River Dam survey plan but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning process to identify what the opportunities are in the Ross River catchment in a media catchment that or but also beyond that as well alright thank you are there any questions from counselors on this matter none I might ask if I could ask the Director of Planning and community the next steps now is the development of a master plan for the through the chairs if the next stage is really is to understand what the vision is for the whole river cross river catchment that 's gonna be a broad document in relation to what what counsel can actually undertake for the whole catchment but also identifying through an implementation plan an action plan what the quick wins might actually be just us activating the Ross River Dam all right and we 'll also take that back out to public consultation correct yes councilman for me all I say if you were to support this it possible it 's good to see with support we 've asked the public for feedback on the survey because that 's what it 's all about going to the public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we said 1,700 people viewed at 318 actually completed it and another 137 having moved the map and giving us some ideas about what they want to see at different locations around there the overwhelming feedback I 've received is supported of expanded use in the Ross ten and to date the battery restocking group has put about a hundred thousand barramundi into the into the dam a lot of these fish now would be reaching about the 60 70 60 to 70 centimeter range so they 're growing quite well and it 's a great stopped area it is hope one day that this dam should we go ahead and it 's all successful be included in the sips program which is the stopped impoundment permit scheme so and that will then allow our recreational fishermen to pay their fifty dollars a year to access it that money goes back into restocking the dam so it 's a it 's a full cycle type thing it 's a great concept and works very well the benefits of townsville was our mentors said CQ you have compiled a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as just fishing without any WI tourism stuff of stock dams around the state across Queensland stock dams fishermen have spent an average of two hundred and seventy two thousand days fishing in the last year which translates into substantial impacts on regional economies expenditure on things like food accommodation and fuel are generating economic activity and this translates into over twenty eight million dollars spent directly into regional areas with dams locked in Rudy Malone generating seven million just on fishing considering towns there 's a boat on a ship of one vote per seven people which is the second highest in the state I think we can expect great things ahead so I fully support this proposal and like to thank the staff for this involvement in getting this report to us today and I look forward to seeing the master plan when ready Thank You Council yes it was a commitment we gave that we in the process sadly the floods yeah put many of our programs delayed the implementation or the or the beginning of many of our programs but we 're still working towards completing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a council report dysfunctional unsupported at the time and now we have a United team that has jointly which falls on this policy to make sure that we can move forward with a positive outcome ends up this consultation process a very detailed one and what 's interesting is it picks up but just about the boating and fishing legislators from the top five sailing sailing sailing which has been a hot topic here for some time 20 right get some more infrastructure but even that the rowing stand-up paddleboarding swimming an end of last one is sailing but what 's quite interesting is there 's been more engaged of those guys that do the bird-watching and the astronomy and a few others so it is the inclusive document and an inclusive report which is very exciting and holistically which is one we had a meeting about five or six years ago was the Astronomy because of the lack of lighting out there that they could actually see space and the stars a lot better so it 's exciting and I think thank you yes councillors this is a this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to understand that any activities the dam cannot jeopardize our drinking here so fundamentally that is that is the one thing that we we have to maintain a very high standard on but I look forward to the next phase which is the master plan in the community consultation that will occur in the in the next council so thank you ever all right we will note that report see we need to vote thank you that report is noted will now go to item 2 which is the magnetic island tri trails draft vision plan and again I think that falls into the director of the planning thank you madam mayor this project is a partnership with the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and that 's worth noting from the outset Council last considered this item back in 28th of May 2009 teen where it resolved to actually allow this to go to public notification terms the next stage the public consultation process occurred for about a month between the 8th of July and 66th of all this 2019 during that process 12 submissions were received and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report review or review report sir and item B which is the amended version plan which incorporates these submissions that were incorporated as part of the public consultation process once again it 's the reports provided for council in relation to the submissions review for noting as well as the vision plan for noting as well alright thank you Thank You mr. director any any views from their local councillor yes thank you madam mayor it 's great to see on some of these amendments and also the number of groups that I have been working closely with on Magnetic Island provide their feedback to this second stage it 's very exciting to see and thank you to the staff involved in that it 's great to see the wayfinding signage as well being included and a few minutes rated made around the picnic bay jetty and things like that I 'm very excited to see this to fruition mummy thank you thank you from what I can gather the consultation councillor went through a wide number of groups from tourism to mirror to Mick dart to mint cap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't make it all better as we know so it 's good to see excellent just query if I know I 'm just bringing it up on my screen and that is you must love the actual trails plan the 26 page PDF will that be released now on the website correct matter man all right okay so it 's interesting you could walk from Nellie Bay across the back to Horseshoe Bay now that links been there for a while so I think this plan will mean that people will find these links a lot easier okay all right if there 's no further comment it 's the recommendation is to note stage two of the submission review and note to amend the actual plan prepared in collaboration with Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service all right yes the mint thank you thank you note the amended all right thank you I 'm just um I just want to check so this has gone through the final stages of engagement correct matter man so now we 'll seek funding partnership funding with the Queensland Government correct and that 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there yeah excellent thank you alright we 'll move forward now to the community engagement the Community Safety Advisory Committee report I might ask councillor Cooke if you wishes to make a statement on this because this is the Advisory Committee yuechu yeah that 's correct madam mayor thank you early this month tells us he counselled hosted the Advisory Committee on forum and Council of oil will refer to that and add on to that and further on at the forum we were privileged to hear from one of the Community Safety Advisory Committee members dr. mark david chung FRS a senior lecturer in criminology and criminal justice James Cook University doctors forum dr. Cheung shed his own insight into the crime prevention in our community and the role that council will play and I 'm pleased to share some of his comments the Townsville City Council as an organisation is not primarily empowered to prevent crime within the community such a task is suited more suited to the police community corrections is justice the prisons and other similar governmental agencies that said Townsville City Council does have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public 's place is public space development and maintenance responsibilities affected through the application of crime prevention through Environmental designs principles or also known as September towns the City Council can also reduce levels or fear of crime through its capacity to inform and communicate important information about crime and community safety issues to the public Townsville City Council through the Community Safety vizor committee has extended its secretary role of crime prevention and Community Safety through key partnerships with these governmental agencies as well as associated NGOs via a range of collaborative initiatives including offender rehabilitate real re ability excuse me I 'll break this in rehabilitative and Community regenerative projects that are carried out with youth justice and Community Corrections through supervision orders and measures and also the Strand crime awareness project with Crimestoppers just to mention a few they were the words of dr. mark david chung barrister-at-law senior lecturer and criminology and criminal justice James Cook University I just like to finish off madam mayor I did thank the the committee members themselves at the last Community Safety Advisory Committee but I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their valuable assistance over the past term of the Community Safety Advisory Committee without their support I don 't think we would have reached the goals that we did over this time so I 'd like to thank you all personally thank you madam mayor thank you the meeting notes I will just noted we 'll move on to the inclusive community advisory committee minutes of the 4th of December 2019 council adore all right so you 're asking us to consider report four and five which are both for noting and I suppose the comment that I 'd like to make at this point in time is more about as councillor Cook alluded to the Advisory Committee forum its take it 's the first time actually I was going to say it 's 12 years in the making but it 's longer than twelve years in the making that all of the advisory committees to Council have been together in one space to share and collaborate in relation to the work that they do for and on behalf of both Council and their community so in the room we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C sac which all our lovely acronyms the Heritage Committee I don 't think I 've forgotten anyone but it was really enlightening for me particularly to hear the work of the other committees you see what comes through Council but it was an honor to sit and hear the champions of each of those committees present the work that they have done on behalf of their community so thank you so much to the staff that pulled that together and for I suppose honoring the committee 's for this this term and I would hope that it goes far beyond and is an annual event from this point for that I will attend as a member of the community Thank You councillor door do you think you could talk about some of the highlights from the inclusion not without crying I suppose the highlights for me there are many but one in particular will always remain the mats the beach mats that we 've installed or that the Johnson City Council has installed on Australia at strand Park and that really was a true collaboration with members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a community perspective and working so collaboratively with council those mats make a difference not only to people with a disability who are potentially you know who are using a wheelchair but for mums with bubs and strollers for older people on wheelie walkers or for anyone with reduced mobility so it 's not just about a person with an identified disability in a wheelchair so as Kaylee sort of indicated Kaylee Downey who represented the ICAT group it 's the beach mats represent far more than a physical access they represent the capacity to participate within the community and be considered people should be included and that 's what a community should be council of dual I was thinking about things such as the Silver level housing the adult change room every park we build now we ensure accessibility inclusive nests having to require government legislation they 're just three or four things that come off and I was going to refer to those a little bit later when we look at the diversity and inclusion strategy 20 22 24 because they 've all been included within that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go Segway straight into those two but we 've got great let us note then will we will note item four and five and five and we will move on to item 6 which is the grants and partnership recommendation report this again I think is in your area mr. director thank you ever thank you madam era item six is regarding the the grants and partnership program of grants less than five thousand dollars these are the grants that were attributed prior to the 15th of January the two items which were approved under delegation at an officer level are identified in the table one within the report in particularly refer to a rolling stone and district Community Association for those Tralee day event in the order of about eighteen hundred dollars cash and the second items in relation to the Coalition on criminal s assault in in the home for an event in relation to a community of women supporting women in community and that it 's the valued about two thousand four hundred fifty dollars the items just for noting for councils thank you in light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women the Queensland domestic violence Resource Centre I think that funding is very much needed can I ask Council a rider how did the inaugural Danny Derby go yes I can imagine for the Rolling Stone community in the areas around Bal Gold Beach those areas they would have thoroughly enjoyed that day I must get an invite if I really yes we met American councillor Ida just actually clarify what is the daily Derby council could you please explain how the dunny to be worked a skew to turn your microphone on please oh sorry it 's a it 's a little square box that 's painted up and the Lions and every group got to paint up there on the toilet and you put someone in a toilet you have to go a fair way you have to pick up a toilet brush a dunny roll and stay in this little box and run like the wind can I say that 's quintessential Australian yes very much so very much alright thank you for that this roll sorry can I quickly add sorry through the chair the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because this year we used the Smarty grants and the the feedback from the community that it was a lot easier and a lot streamlined so thank you for the start of the the revamp of this grant system Thank You Council yes it 's taken its time but I think we 're starting to make some significant progress thank you for that item six is for noting if there 's no further comments we 'll move on to item 7 which is the indoor the livable study to it doors he studied to endorse his to vote so councilors can I have someone move that we endorse the livability strategy of 2020 2024 thank you I 'll go to council a duel and I 'll have to take councillor Walker as second if I may all right any comments um I suppose one of the things that I would like to point out in relation to the livability study is the alignment of the deliberative deliverables I 've got a little bit of a council of cut going on here where it attributes areas of responsibility within Council so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Council has taken on an area of responsibility in relation to the deliver the livability strategy and the alignment between the livability strategy and the diversity include an inclusion strategy is not to be underplayed either so the synergies and connections between those documents is important Thank You counsel with that we might put that to a vote we have a mover and seconder if no one else wishes to comment all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you councillors we 'll move on now to item 8 which is the recommendation to endorse the diversity and inclusion strategy I 'll ask again for a mover and seconder before I ask for a speaker Thank You councillor Doyle seconded councillor greeny any comments from you councillor Doyle this is another one first of all I wanted to thank the team for a start particularly sally butler and the team and i know that started the journey with Donna Jackson as well and a number of people within the team and not to be underplayed again is the relationship that exists with the staff of Community Development future cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if an infrastructure everybody plays a role and madam mayor where you highlight at some of those areas before you can see those within councils role in providing a diverse and inclusive City so not only have we put in place physical infrastructure such as the adult change facilities and the state government has just opened the stadium and obviously there is an adult change facility in there McBurney was very happy to show that to the world the other day but Townsville City Council is not far behind with the treu Brook pool also having a change facility which will change people 's lives programs such as changing lives and changing communities as a whole of community approach the mobility mapping again which outlines for community members who have reduced mobility and particularly those in a wheelchair how they can easily access and get around the city and that will extend beyond just the CBD range so the actions of the inclusive communities Advisory Committee what we have what we 're doing in terms of NAIDOC and our reconciliation action plan which was nationally recognized so as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of the library services like it 's it 's embedded within this council so thank you Thank You councillor Doyle are there any other comments because this is a very very good strategy it 's the best parting gift I get all right and we have a mover and seconder I might ask do the through the Director of Planning and Community Services is there any comment that the staff may wish to make on this strategy not for my perspective madam mayor but there are chief strategy officer may want some comments or even Sally and let 's go fishing Thank You Sally all right I think what I would like to say on this is diversity is central to innovation and the more diverse and accepting a community is the more innovative it is the the greater the job prospects but it 's also the fact that we value diversity and inclusion of our community in our city and the strategy clearly outlines that so I think councillor Doyle you 've left the council in a much better place than where it was eight years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the the paper arc but it is and this is the comment on the front of the paper diversity is being invited to the party inclusion is being asked to dance and Sally I think that 's a wonderful phrase to open this strategy with so thank you all and thank you all for your collaboration on this project we have a mover and seconder I will put it to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you counselors will now move to item nine which is the final Audit Committee meeting minutes of the 21st of November can I have a mover please Thank You councillor oh no my apologies these are just for noting my apologies so the recommendation is to note the minutes of the Audit Committee held on the 21st of November 2019 and the 9th of December are there any comments on those minutes if not then we 'll we 'll take them as noted we 'll move to item ten that is the corporate performance report now if I could ask with the CEO or with the Director of Planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period October 1st to December 31st so lots of highlights in that period of time there are some highlighted on the CEO message so delivering in that period was our hundred percent take-up of the water smart package we also open the new sensory playground in uplands we are we increased our CCT footage and partnership with QPS around the city the community celebrated all the Christmas activities of which many were involved we also endorsed the first indigenous panel supply panel with 59 indigenous businesses we also upgrade to a number of our intersections and roads the Civic Theatre had its four official opening in that period and we participated and became world record holders with our world record of high-vis in the one place as well with 2499 participants so the quarter to report does present lots of highlights that 's a few of the minutes before you today just noting thank you Thank You Stacey yes the report is before us including the Mount Louisa open space master plan a halloween-themed Townsville eats I believe that was a spectacularly wonderful event our work in mentally healthy cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of our libraries things like the Summer Reading Club for our children it doesn 't matter how rich you are the libraries are there for everyone so everyone every child has the opportunity to be a part of these sort of programs so congratulations see do you wish to make any comment sorry about the microphone and I just that it 's pleasing to say that it 's the fourth such corporate report that shows no items being overdue that 's important and can I raise the point in relation to CCTV madam me I hope I have the figure right and the director of infrastructure and operations I 'm sure will correct me if I 'm wrong but now we 've reached the point where we have well over 300 CCTV cameras in strategic locations and we continue to work with the police servicing and I commend the Safety Committee in the work that they 've done but it is another of their secondary roles of the vital from an organizational point of view and it 's a role that we can play to support the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madam Li thank you very much see all right um if I can ask councillor kun please thinking about a man I 'd also like to point out that this performance was under duress in that this organization was undertaking some very heavy lifting in the recovery space after the floods last year you can actually take accolades for delivering on this and doing that quantum of work at the same time it is amazing I don 't know that it 's ever been done like this before by this organisation and the other thing that I would like to say about this report is that outside of the chamber in certain parts of the community there are accusations often that we are not as transparent as we need to be I think if that 's the case people aren 't looking they 're not looking in the right areas and this report actually shows the quantum of work that has taken place within this organization for this community over that period of time and I would recommend it to the community to look at it thank you Thank You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have all the reports it 's just a matter of of taking the time to read them any other comments all right the can I have someone move that we receive this report Thank You councillor Combe do I have a seconder Thank You councillor Rabine being no other comments I will put it to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you I 'll now move on to item 11 which is the financial services budget variance report so I will ask if I could ask the Director of Corporate Services please Stacy if you would like to comment on this thank you madam mayor so through the chair of the BB are the budget variance report is presented to you for noting today noting this is for January 2020 and it does just point out in there our operating and capital revenue and expenses so both on largely on revenue is on budget expenses both for capital and operating a largely due to timing differences with projects being delivered and capitalization of those projects thank you madam ma 'am thank you all right any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah it 's fairly straightforward yes council sorry um our debt when we can go till the next item from the Treasury report thank you so the southern suburbs rising Maine is is will be completed by September of this year everything around the stadium at that point was on on time so we look to deliver hopefully before the Broncos game all right Thank You counselors and that one is for noting if I could now ask you to move to item 12 which is the Treasury report item 12 item 12 if we can move now to item 12 that a Treasury report any comments from counselors and that 's the one with counselor it is a very good outcome thank you and I would like Alaskan vote council came if she wishes to make any comment on the report it is quite a good report I think you might have merit yes it is a good report and certainly I think we can congratulate the staff for bringing us in with this report in January I note that we haven 't draw drawn down any extra debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so every bit that we don 't borrow we 're saving I would like to say from a debt perspective we do it we 're going in the right direction I think council maliki know was hinting towards the trends that we 've got going there and I think that that 's an important piece of work that has been done but has only been able to be done because of the heavy lifting that was done at the early part of our term and it was something that we had to take on it 's not necessarily an easy thing to do but it has been done and it 's paid dividends already for this city and will continue to do so thank you Thank You councillor can I note that the debt to community assets we 're well below the 10% target that 's set by Queensland Treasury we 're at seven point one nine percent so if you relate it to a 500,000 loan on a house we owe 40,000 in Treasury keep asking us to borrow more money anyway so that reporters for noting counselors item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street there is a request from a recommendation from the offices that we resolve that the exception in section 2 3 6 1 see part far apart fall of the local government regulation would apply to this sale they wish to purchase a small parcel of council land next to their building council officers have a head of look and they have no objection to selling the parcel of land we would use one of our values to determine the sale price and we 've also done public consultation around the other buildings and facilities around there and there 's no objections through their methods recommendation is to proceed and discuss with the owners all right thank you councils are there any questions on this matter it 's fairly straightforward all right can I have someone move Thank You councilman okay now second at councillor greeny that we accept the officers recommendation if there 's no further comment we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you we 'll move on to item 14 which is the Townsville water and waste inspection plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think Danny you 'll be responsible for this yes madam mayor council has approved this inspection program of all sewers and privacy of strains we come to Council when we do new suburbs so as part of this program on the 1st between April we want to do a three-month program for annandale clewd and Douglas Adalia in a number it just helps us identify any illegal connections and certainly then we can prosecute the people so it 's just a report we 've been doing since probably 2008 and letting council know what areas will be affected my apologies my computer 's logged out I 'm just trying to log back in are there any questions of Danny on this matter yes thank you counsel Walker question madam mayor just that it 's good timing in relation to just not including a day and remember and in and out are the areas that were part of the monsoon event and having this testing is very very important because it will detect other things as well along the way which is give some more confidence to the community as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I in fact I would also hope that the southern suburbs Maine will assist many of the other issues that are in these areas will be completed by September alright um there 's a recommend the the offices recommendation is we improve this inspection program can I have a mover please Thank You council Walker can I have a second to councillor Maliki no if there is no other comment or discussion I will put that to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you councilors will now move on to item 15 which is the Townsville water and waste customer and business reporting for the second quarter of the year again I might ask the director of infrastructure danny Lynch if he has any comments to make thanks madam mayor might pass this to the general manager of towns water and waste years he has written a report thank you thank you Scott if you could come forward they 're awesome areas that thank you Scott are there any questions for Scott all right are they to the chair do you wish to make any comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues I did have I raised it on my regular meetings with Scottie Moorhead thank you thank you all right if that 's the case this report is just for noting so we 've noted the report ladies and gentlemen we have a one confidential item and then we will need to deal with that and then we will move into general business could I have someone move that we move into closed council Thank You councillor Coombs second a councillor Walker all those in favor against carried unanimously so this item effects budget you confidential and that the documentary remain confidential unless council decides otherwise by resolution and that we note that should it be successful in securing the events the associated costs will be included as part of the 2020 2021 major events partnership budget so can I have someone move those recommendations Thank You counsel Walker seconded councillor greeny all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you councillors are now moving to general business and I would like to invite councillor Koo Doyle and Jacob please if they wish to say to give a report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Thank You councillor Jacob yes thank you madam M it 's been an honor to serve my community and the wider community of Townsville for four years and I would especially like to thank the TTC staff for their insight and their management abilities my main reason for not nominating again I have outlined in the letter to the Townsville Bulletin some months ago and I reiterate the new Belle Cara legislation has in my view thrown the baby out with the bathwater in reference to an individual councillor who wishes to stand alone but I do believe as a council we have failed this community on transparency and accountability for all of our constituents thank you Thank You council could I now ask just counselor okay Thank You Metta ma 'am it 's been another privilege to serve the people of Townsville four generations of my family have lived worked and carried on business in this city since the late 1800s I 'm humbled to have carried on the legacy of the hence Peters as a family who have literally and figuratively built Townsville personally politics and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our community in this capacity is both unique and irreplaceable and for that I would like to thank you personally madam M right up front I 'd like to acknowledge my tribe my family friends and network of amazed bald people who have walked this path with me I would also like to acknowledge the people around this table those that work 7 for the future of this city upon reflection I 'm incredibly proud of what we have achieved over the last four years with a major reform agenda and our transformation program delivering 40 men over 40 million dollars in savings for the community these reforms and savings will continue to pay future dividends they have already enabled us to achieve records spent in infrastructure projects and a demonstrable culture in transparency and engagement with the community we 've also delivered fully funded water security for Townsville in 2020 TCC is a more contemporary and agile organization and as the chair of governance and Finance Committee I 'm particularly proud of these savings and reforms and that council is now delivering better value for money for ratepayers because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to take advantage of future economic opportunities and council is laser focused on delivering those outcomes for the city in the wake of the 2019 monsoons of the economic a chair of economic recovery task force it was a privilege to work with the state and federal government government agencies and community members through this task force we secured over 10 million dollars in funding for small business recovery and I look forward to seeing that being delivered over the next two years closer to home in Division six with funding from state government works for Queensland program we delivered lighting and CCTV for the river way walking loop and in science to Douglas and Condon we also worked on larger scale projects such as river ways splash park and Murray spawning complex master plan which will add value to all who live in division six and to the city as a whole thank you to the residents who have worked with me to achieve changes in their streets and suburbs and for understanding that there is always a long wish list that is only limited by time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional leadership and staff and I would like to acknowledge every single one of them in particular our previous CEO Adele young current CEO Mike Kyoto ever Bertrand Danny Lynch and my director Stacy Coburn I would also like to single out Brett Brogan Stacey Gibson and David Lynch who have had the opportunity to work closely with through the recovery and Tony Bly and Graham Finlayson for the excellent advice they have given me you 're all talented individuals an amazing team doing great things for our city I 've been equally inspired by the people of the city working outside of the walls of Council those in the art set sector like kyle and amber Paige Terry Braben Jonathan McBurney people such as Steve Mahdi Michelle Morton Peter wheeler Faye Bakker and Debbie juice those in hospitality and events Jamie Fitzpatrick Matt Marin Michael Jones and those leading community-based and sporting organizations marie-claude Brown John Kelly Gary Sam Bosco peter fry Magnolia and general white they 've all contributed in many ways outside the chamber of Council City Council which I will also aim to do in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this country local government are being asked to do a lot of heavy lifting well beyond roads rates and rubbish I 've total respect for anyone who puts their name on a piece of paper at any level of government to serve their community however I have great faith in the people around this table to continue to deliver great outcomes for this city and who hopefully will continue to occupy these seats past April there are a number of things I 've advocated for which I would like to see continue all started that every decision council takes is with the aim to grow retain and attract smart people to this city secondly I advocated for more focus being placed on our younger demographic we invest very well in our older residents our children and our families we need more for our fifteen to twenty fives now that we have a stadium we have a vehicle to attract world-class unique content unique being the operative word and I will also continue to advocate that we need to change the name of our region for tourism marketing to magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are literally in competition for that dollar with the Gold Coast Sunshine Coast Fraser Coast whitsunday Coast you get the idea within one hour versity we have every Australian experience one could desire Reef rainforests the Outback and tropical islands taking in magnetic Hinchinbrook and Orpheus Islands charters Taos Hinchinbrook and the bird accan the name Magnetic Coast captures the essence of our beautiful natural wonders but also hints at what an amazing place this area is to live work and play what better advertisement then to have your brand 's say you will not be able to resist the attraction of the magnetic coast for the city that has so much going for it I still still see Townsville as a gangly teenager like teenagers do we can often get in our own way sometimes we can get down on ourselves wondering when we will grow up being hyper critical of ourselves looking everywhere for approval and trying to be like the others when we recognize and embrace our unique beauty and gifts we will mature into the city we were always meant to be speaking of teenagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the support and encouragement of my own campaign car and I will be paying for the therapy for that for sure they are now both finished high school and searching for their own creative and meaningful ways to do good work and maintain yourself to anyone else you are way cooler than you think creative and clever you are easy to be around and you are beautiful inside and out you have so much potential I believe in you finding those things that are amazing about you the things that set you apart and double down on those things forget about everything else don 't listen to those that talk smack about you even the voices inside your own head trust yourself adulting is hard work but it 's much more satisfying than being a teenager nobody learned anything from winning all the time use your losses to do better and be better keep working hard but make sure you find the time to celebrate your wins and enjoy yourself love yourself and be authentically you there is nothing else I hope that I have done your proud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though our relationship is going to change I love you and that one thing will never change peace out Thank You councillor Kim you 've probably taken all the good things I was going to say but that 's fine I now call upon councillor Doyle if you would like to take a deep breath it is with a tinge of sadness that I addressed the chamber today it 's the last time as councillor Colleen Doyle so get it in there where you can mic today with the presentation of the diversity and inclusion strategy 20 22 24 I leave knowing that council City Council is well and truly back on track in the area that led me to nominate for council in 2012 in 2008 I was the manager of community services and community development for the Townsville City Council and I was very proud of the work that we did however I left an organization I could no longer watch or participate in the dismantling of services which were directed at delivering were directed out and delivering to us our services for the most vulnerable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in focus failed this community this sort of work is vital to the social fabric of our community in creating livable and healthy cities and communities I wish to thank from the bottom of my heart my friends and my colleagues here in this room my fellow councillors you 've all supported me in this journey and I suppose in essence to return to the future I know I 've annoyed the crap out of you on occasions with it but you 've listened to me and you 've owned it and you 've helped to drive this return to focus it 's been an honor to represent my peeps in Division nine so anyone who knows me knows that I grew up in Hermann Park and I will always consider myself and hermit parki I 've loved being your counsellor and paying my role as custodian for the area for the last eight years I want to acknowledge all the work of the staff all the work all the staff that I 've ever worked with I want to thank you for all that you have done all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special mention to my team in community development libraries galleries arts and theatre you 've always supported me you 've always shown and you 've always shown your absolute dedication to this city so I thank you and there have been occasions when unfortunately Judith Jensen 's not still in the room but she literally did have my back I want to thank specially to my coordinator and partner mark davines and human and social recovery thank you for standing next to me and holding on to me on occasions when I wanted to fold special thanks to ever Stacey and Danny the executive team who again I think put up with me on a number of occasions but I share and that 's the important thing they actually share the vision for this community and to mr. Tony blye I 've worked with you as a colleague so as a staff member but also as a counselor and I thank you I thank you for your absolute honesty on many occasions with me CEO what can I say I 've watched you defend support and protect the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the best CEO that I have ever had the privilege of working with I thank you for always having the staffs back because I know how important that is councillor Walker on backs thank you for having mine particularly in term one as a newbie councillor you actually protected me on more than one occasion so thank you imagine he 'll welcome this it 's been a bit of a trip and I can remember clearly when you came back you came to me in 2009 and asked me if I 'd be part of the team that you 're assembling it 's been an honor to work alongside you we have fought and I 've screamed that you are more than one occasion but we have always got together to a point of understanding so thank you you are what this city needs so stay strong and lead Townsville to the greatness that it deserves to be it again but always remember and I 'm quoting Aristotle here that the whole is greater than the part of the sum of its parts I am proud of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thank you for having me I will ask if there 's any other general business from any councillor before I make some closing statements all right I would like to thank councillor Jacob councillor Doyle and councillor Combe for your service to our community it came at a time when and councillor Doyle and councillor Walker will remember when we really had a council that was dysfunctional there wasn 't United that didn 't share a vision and did not really have the city 's best interests at heart and I remember fighting to try and keep something as simple as the home assist program for our pensioners that was a program that was lost as a result of not having a counsel there was actually caring about its community we 've come a long way from from that point we 've come to a point where we 've been in this term reformed to recovery we 've made commitments and we 've delivered and I know for some of you we lost some of you and the journey on the way but understand this this organization has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more transparent it is an organization that is now prepared to consult and consult widely it is not fixed in its views but it is fixed in its vision for this community we I want to thank councillor Kuhn particularly our journey on defense and when I think now of what we have in terms of a defense strategy for the attraction of industry it is the first time this council has ever participated in a forum like that and I truly believe that policy alone will set the foundations for employment in this community if we can get everything we want and I think we can for the next 50 years I want to thank all of you in coming on the journey around new technology and new industries the smart the concept of a smart city it 's more it 's more than just about connecting connecting our community to the gig world it really is about developing the real jobs in the future in 2016 one of our biggest employers shut its doors months literally weeks or the council election and we 've struggled with that over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of employment in terms of the mental health and as a council we are taking that fight up to bring those jobs into our community and we 've done all of that in keeping our budgets balanced in keeping ensuring that we still delivered services without impacting on our ratepayers and it 's been a tough call but also in those four years we kept our commitments to the arts community and in fact I had the pleasure at the AFC m to remind people that the concert hall is now part of the city deals so without one step closer I want to acknowledge all the staff particularly those staff who have come on board since the reform of this organization none of this none of our commitments meant anything unless we implemented them into our corporate plan and into our operational plan and we did do that so that we can ensure that when we made our commitments we actually delivered them not like the previous term of council I want to thank all of you in the room for being united in the overall vision for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the previous term and I want to acknowledge and I thank you to all of you for acknowledging Adele Young and the work she did in the reforming of this organization but also of Mike of Stacey of uber of Danni and even Brett in his area in future cities a new concept for any council and can I say it 's one that I am constantly asked about by other mayor 's so I suspect in the New World Order we will see future cities in other local governments but the first council to ever do it was Townsville councillor Jacob you 're right the changes to the local government legislation do make it harder for any of us to nominate and sit around this table it 's not legislation that I think was warranted but it 's the rules of the game that now we all have to play with and all of us both counselors and staff it 's a tricky dynamic and I believe more legislation will roll out in the next term so for those people who are looking to stand for council be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three departing councillors as I said for your service I truly want to thank my thank you no I 'm kidding this is hard for me and thank all of you my fellow councillors we 've been in the ditch a few times together you 've had my back I 've had yours this is the last council meeting of this term good luck on your endeavours all of you whether it 's to seek re-election or to seek new pastures and all I can say is in the next five weeks the citizens of this community will decide whether or not we have done a good job and whether or not we deserve reelection and I 'm very happy to stand on the record of this council thank you I 'll now close this meeting at 30 thank you very much for your attendance","(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

deputations there are none there are no notices of motions I 'd like to move now to our first presentation today which is from the Townsville Business Development Center if I could ask mr. Brennan to come for please Thank You mayor hill councillors ladies and gentlemen it 's great to see so many people here to serve out the Townsville Business Development Center we 've got a fairly large slide deck that we provided to Council in relation to the presentation so I won 't go through all of them and councillors can can go through that at their leisure but what I really wanted to cover off on with him about the key pieces that the Business Development Center wanted to to bring to counsels attention and then follow up with effectively a thank you for the assistance we provide we 've been provided by council today make this work so for those that aren 't aware the business development centers been around for 25 years and and fundamentally we act as a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region and we do that primarily through the provision at first instance of subsidized rent but more so our focus is on providing tools to build resilient and sustainable business in the region we 've gone about that through various different guises over the last 25 years but we we think we 're getting to a more formal space now and that 's part of where the the Business Development Center is is looking to go we 're not-for-profit business the we have a management committee of volunteers which like all volunteer committees is quite onerous at Tom 's for those involved but it speaks volumes to the amount of work that the volunteers have done over the last two years in particular our two of our members Rebecca Bioman deep seeing alumni of the Townsville Enterprise emerging leaders and that 's certainly something that we want to encourage moving forward as well so we 'd be looking forward to continued engagement with with tell our center is least from the council out of Vickers Road and there 's a few snapshots there in the slide and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focusing on is the the place of smaller micro business in Townsville over the last couple of or the last two years in particular we as a board went back and wanted to assess whether there was at first instance a need for the Business Development Center and and how that need would be best met I guess there 's a strategic review more than anything else we really went back and tried to figure out where the Business Development Center fitted into the the ecosystem the small business in Townsville and and how best we could reply their resources that we 've got we really came up with two questions we 're a small business is engaged in Townsville and are they struggling and and how can we assist that quickly the best place to look at is some stats and you can go through these and Malaysia as I know everyone loves looking at stats slides fundamentally the key movement for us was the number of small businesses in Townsville and where they are engaged and even with the shifting of people from what your classes traditional business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still are largely a group of small businesses around construction and professional services that has that hasn 't changed so one of the concerns we had and this goes back to the GFC was the number of small businesses in Townsville and we saw that there was a decrease which matched nationally and then we were looking at are they coming back and those those slides just demonstrate the exits and entries and also the level of small businesses operating in Townsville what probably worried us the most was that we thought it might have been a national trend or a state trend but you can see on the numbers here in Queensland and nationally business numbers are coming back whereas in Townsville we haven 't quite jumped back into small business the way the rest of the business community has and so that really asks made us question will where as our role in this and what can we do to fix that what we see as being both small business operators or engaged with small business the the two big roadblocks that we saw were a real lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the poor survival rates for businesses that start up and they 're really that the key weaknesses for small business and micro business in not only Townsville but across the country based on that we could see that there was still a need for the Business Development Center and our key focus should be in that space around construction and I guess the more traditional small business areas there 's still a there are other places that can deal with emerging technologies but we still saw a large role for a traditional small business environment this is where the partnership with the council is so important the the space that we 've got out there at Vickers Road has been instrumental in so many businesses starting off and and getting through and really where we 're going now our goal is to help people start in the first three years of operation and plan for the pitfalls that come and the flooding last year was a key indicator of no one would have planned for that sort of business downturn or that sort of business interruption and having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would have that plan in their back pocket so whether it 's a flood whether it 's a key staff member leaving whether it 's a market being disrupted what we thought is that small business really needs to understand what makes their businesses tick in order to to survive any any downturns that 's where we see that business development center working in with with council and helping to deliver on that the programs that council lead through growing our economy one of our key aspect one of our key partnerships sorry mode of delivering is through partnerships we can 't do it ourselves as a volunteer group so that 's where we 've been able to bond partner with specific service providers and we see the council being a key part of that as well through the many of the services offered out of character our latest partner and the one we 're most excited about is our MoU with TAFE Queensland and that 's going to be a key part of the deliverables out of the center this just demonstrates the survival rates for small business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where most of the people fall through the cracks so our goal is to give people the skills and the the ability to weather that first three years and then plow on and and with that boosts air input into the into the economy of Townsville as well and again we talked about the establishment of an education platform traditionally and we go back to the service level agreement we did have with council and it was about providing education moving forward what we want to do is not just be a cheap rental space but also couple any tenancy with the obligation to do at least assert foreign business through TAFE and they 've provided us with a means of delivering that in a way that 's not onerous for business and moving forward we want to make sure that people understand those businesses and we 've got a 25 year collaboration with local government through the Vickers the service level agreement both have expired both need to be renewed we 've been able to obtain funding through curator or some significant grants or some alone to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's when we approached Council to firm up the lease which we 've we 're hoping to achieve that 's what we 're after they 're moving forward for the next five years the last couple of years have been really hard for us there 's no doubt we 've been focused on survival we 've had to do a lot of strategic renewal we 've had to look at ourselves in the Hall of Mirrors we said and we 've had to work hard as a board on what we stand for and how we want to present to the broader ecosystem and now that we 've done that the the implementation of our key strategic projects are the service level agreement at least with the council completing our resilience grant review which again we obtained through curator and we 'll be doing a strategic review of the rent roll what makes we have of tenancy as being discounted tenants and which ones are commercial tenants just so that we can make it commercially viable for us and to finalize and illiberal Nemo you would take in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories there 's been quite a lot happened in the last two years this is one of our great success stories with as a service provider now where we have been helping indigenous unemployed get training and certification in rail construction and so that 's been a great boost we 're entering into an MoU with those guys as well and we 've provided a lot of training through them in the last year all this has been possible with the that the support of council when the demand ball was damaged the council team got in there got it fixed it 's been a lingering problem for a number of years it 's now fully operational and for the first time we will be able to completely have seven-year businesses we open the the the reopen the mandible in October and we held a traditional smoking ceremony a smoking ceremony with the representative traditional owners and just as the final part of this presentation I just want to have a show a quick video of that because it was a really important milestone moment for us as a as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center so hopefully this works [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that 's pretty much did anyone have any questions I do like sorry in terms of the finalization of the MoU with TAFE is there a timeline associated with that like midway through the year or in terms of when people can commence us it we we 've already got the first class going through now okay so I think we 've got four five students going through there at the moment two of them Maria so our staff just to get a feel for it so we 've started that already so it 's the next stage is transitioning the existing tenants into doing that course and then as tenants leave making that a term of the ongoing or the taking attendance here thank you yes thank you sir and then counselor Maliki no sorry Brendan with the grant you got from the other part of the government was that reliant on council signing an MoU for the lease yeah that they were concerned about our security of tenure even that we even though we 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're on a effectively a rolling tenancy so yes it 's part of the securing that is having the lease signed off by Council and what was the value of the commitment from council via is that public knowledge or is it okay to ask that the previous service level agreement was said I think two hundred thousand in terms of in-kind value and that was based on a rental assessment done back in 2015 so I think there was the rental component and then I think some repairs and maintenance and in fact it into that as well and was that for a five-year period no that was that was a three-year period so that the previous service level agreement so they 're two separate agreements but we 'd like them coupled so thank you so like just clarify counsel there 's an MOU as a service level agreement and there 's the agreement to lease the premises so that 's worth over the life of the lease about a million dollars so Anthony revenue for council yep so we have upon is a million dollar commitment for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in I just wondering what 's the capacity what would you do at the moment we 've got I think it 's 29 units yeah 29 22 units at 55 square meters and seven units at 12 square meters and then we 've got we run training through the the conference center as well and we 've been trying to get brains to update that the conference rooms to increase the IT and we 're applying through the gambling always a work out deciding to leave my job and open a small business is an idea how would I go about discovering the TV deceive what sort of places would you go through to find that first exists and secondly what sort of things at all well we have been working with count well certainly with council but with the chamber and again through there 's the various small business associations and incubators we 're part of a couple of those but Facebook social media the way most people do these days we 've been pretty quiet and that front just pending getting all of this sorted out but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising through the chamber and and through accountants banks lawyers trying to get them to get their clients to come and see us as they as a first step thank you any other questions from counsels I just had one the Corrado grant you obtained could I ask which one that was yeah we have to there was the ten thousand dollar resilience grant which we 're applying to and that 's going to be used for our modeling in terms of the cash flow and business plan and then there was I don 't know what the other one is called but it was a larger hundred thousand yeah it was in that space but we only got 40,000 but it was that larger tranche here thank you if there 's no other questions Michael thank you for coming and providing not just us but obviously the community with some information around the work of the Townsville Business Development Center thank you now if I could ask and I 'm going to use the full name pop-up food trucks who are now taking over our Townsville Kotter 's market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen thank you very much for that these pop-up food trucks or we like to call it puffed its hopefully everyone walking out today nice it 's a pop nothing else popped event someone it 's Johnny this is sicko and we 've got Dan I just want everyone just a I guess cast their mind back 20 30 years ago and just have a vision of or think about what you thought or Cotters back then I think over the last three months or when we knew that this was a pretender we obviously had our ideas but talking to a lot of people about what they thought God has used to be and I guess compare it to now as well and everyone 's got a thousand ideas so there 's a few up here that I think I reckon people will sort of go yeah yeah that makes sense but to me it was about obviously the rides buskers the amount of stalls that are in there and I think the most most important thing and this is probably what I remember the most it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and there would just be people everywhere and I guess that 's kind of our vision moving forward I don 't know maybe they 're taking a little bit too much on but we feel we can get to the gift to the point where you are up one end and you can 't see more than 20 meters in front of you because there 's thousands of people shouldn 't really quite myself on thousands but lots of people yeah yeah so just a little bit of a history about us so we came around in 2016 2016 and and it was really for the sole purpose and this is what we sort of envisioned is we want to we want to bring the community get together it 's a great food great entertainment and great people so we grew a month a month and well 2019 was completely it was a massive year for us and it got to the point where we 're like okay what 's next what do we want to do and then luckily at the end of 2019 God has got us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of looked away and thought about it and look back at each other went yeah okay we can do it so our vision for 2020 is is to work alongside the council City Council all the score holders the food vendors local businesses community groups and most importantly I think the consumers to make cottage downsells premier market once again now from the 2nd of February our first job obviously was to have site fees I would drop down to 20 to get creators talking again about Kotter 's our algorithm is easy it 's cheaper sites more vendors more variety more interests I since the weekend we obviously walked the street on on Sunday introducing ourselves and we 've had about 20 inquiries from people that have never had stalls before so we 're really excited already from the 5th of April we 're gonna be focusing on people coming to cutter 's maybe for the first time in years we would love Coty 's to be engaging and interactive free and low-cost activities for families focusing on children of all ages dan will be going into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a reason for people not only to come to Coty 's but to sit down have a coffee and make it a integra part of their Sundays their ongoing community relationships could be paramount so we want coders to be a platform for creators of all all different ages we want the community groups to be able to use coders as a springboard for their causes and we want to link like-minded people people passionate about Townsel and passionate about coders our overall plan is to utilize Flinders Street by bringing new stools onto the street by doing this we hope to create a fun vibrant and happening atmosphere through the entire street there is already a great variety of stalls at cutters we want to expand on this to include bric-a-brac old tools and wares up cycled furniture unique food items including specialty and deli products such as spices Swami 's cheese and olives as the market grows extra unique food vendors will be added so consumers have an array of choices for breakfast morning tea and lunch young families are important to cutter 's we will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well in this area a Kids Corner will be created full of games fun plus the and plus the potential to include rock-climbing as an additional paid option for consumers for the health conscious and active families we 're working on off bring a free family yoga session at the start of the markets the live music will continue we expect this to grow into more school and community groups even a second stage located as the market expands we also encourage new and current buskers to continue to attend the markets starting from this week we have implemented three inflatable archways as a way to recognize and welcome people into the markets we have added to the existing furniture with our new power well bench seats these benches these benches are available for people to sit down have a chat great for community friendship and well-being we expect all these vibrant items combined will bring the markets back to one of the must dues for visitors and locals on the Town Hall events calendar now our mission statements has always been extremely important to us since the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement like a filter now for 2020 we 're gonna be expanding and encompassing my town might sound so this

services counselor doll has declared a conflict on this matter now I believe we have two two people speaking would Natalie Everett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh thank you net um if I could ask you to come forward thank you Matt and again madam mayor and councillors thanks the opportunity to address you today my name is Matt Everett wife Natalie in the audience said we 're own occupies a contributing property to the grand Queenslanders character precinct my wife and I are respondents to the public notice of the development application MCU 19 82 and have been fully engaged with your plans team since then but we still have a couple of residual concerns and appreciate this opportunity to to table those in broad terms they are size and scale and traffic safety so first size and scale so I understand from the Townsville City plan that the purpose of the Wills Street precinct in which this developments proposed is that the built form creates a medium rise environment up to four storeys in building height throughout the precinct and provides for a sensitive transition in scale to nearby character residential zoned land which in this case I understand to be the ground Queenslanders character precinct the Townsville City plan specifies two performance outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 88 which is building height and scale is to be consistent with the character desired of that precinct and performance outcome 89 the built form provides for sensitive transitioning in height and scale to nearby character residential zoned land the development application and materials available online scene not to address either of these important specifications directly however it 's quite obvious from the drawings that the proposed development is significantly larger than any other structure currently in the will Street and adjacent grande Queenslanders precincts so I contest that the size and scale of the proposed development which is eight levels high with 36 metre wide frontage when viewed from the CBD is grossly non-compliant with the medium rise medium density environment intended for the Wolfe Street precinct I also contested the proposed the proposal for the oversize development situated at the southern threshold to the grand Queenslanders precinct fails to provide for sensitive transitioning in height and scale what this will mean is that some of the glimpses of the grand print the grand Queensland is currently available from CBD public spaces will be permanently obscured by the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this development there 's also risk of similar problems if such an oversized building was to be placed on the vacant land opposite this one currently now under traffic safety because the building is too big in my opinion and therefore too many residents were too many chars there 's a traffic management problem the development application and subsequent queries from and responses to you the canceled plans team establishing well over ten pages of analysis the traffic management will be complex and will require robust discipline from residents in order to maintain safety on wills Stokes and Hale streets as you know State Street is busy and very popular also with cyclists and pedestrians and I believe the complex traffic situation caused by the development would significantly increase the risk to safety on these roads so summing up I believe that the size and scale of the development have not been correctly considered in accordance with the performance outcomes specified for the medium height will Street precinct as specified in the Townsville city plan and may set a precedent for further insensitivity of the grand Queenslanders precinct transition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development would significantly increase the risk to safety of all users of our rights thank you again for this opportunity proponent Steven mati thank you madam mayor councillors I speak on behalf of the applicant and with respect to this application as council is aware you know I don 't want go into too much time by giving a comprehensive assessment that I see has been included in today 's agenda including conditions under which the development is to be delivered fundamentally the development seeks to respond to councils contemporary planning scheme it looks quite properly to pick up the cues of that planning scheme a particularly strategic framework your contemporary scheme looks to talk of a compact and efficient City that 's led by intensified residential development in and around the CBD it looks to promote a range of residential offers to contribute the housing and lifestyle choice it looks to ensure that vibrant activity centers including the CBD remain viable through the support of residential areas council would be aware of the nature of the site it 's a site that is not a typical site it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base RL in the order of about 20 to 23 metres now that 's at the southern extent city side as you go towards will Street will Street RL is in the order of 33 to 34 metres and a representation of those to be found looking at your agenda on page 19 there 's a little elevation there that so shows how the building is to be promoted the level that will Street of 30 to 33 meters is on the city side on the other side council would be aware of the cliff forming and at the property boundaries then on the east and western side of will Street we have our ELLs in the order of 40 to 42 meters as we progressed then up the hill we move into property levels of about 45 metres ultimately to the Victoria Street which were in the order of 55 meters so there 's a 20 plus made a difference from the base of the building and that 's been recognized before council would be aware of an earlier approval at this site that effectively presented a footprint not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed five storeys presenting to Hale Street that was a decision that was thought to be confirmed by the Planning and Environment Court which were also committed to that outcome so the tests have been considered in the past but doesn 't dismiss the need to assess the merits of this application and this application has been supported by a number of technical reports most technical reports include engineering traffic and geotechnical to confirm the development can be delivered safely in an expectation of councillors planning scheme with respect to traffic to locations for access our proposed one up will Street which will be back into the rear of the property that will be provided to one level only and providing in the order of about 21 car parks at the moment that access is used for about 28 car parks is actually a diminishment of utility of that access way the principal access is to be off first Oak Street the traffic report has identified that the number of traffic movements proposed by the development won 't compromise the integrity of the street or the intersections and how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts along State Street given that it is a road that has gradient and it is not proposed that there 's an always murder always movement at that location the design is chores that there 's a left in left out only that are proposed and delivery of that outcome will be secured by again reasonable and relevant conditions council would be aware that performance outcomes of the scheme are important and often supported by acceptable solutions it is right that the subject land is in the will Street precinct which has an acceptable solution of four stories as councils also aware acceptable solutions not the only design outcome other solutions may be considered given that the scheme is a performance based scheme and so on that basis that Heights been considered recognizing the strategic framework and its clear objectives and recognizing the other code obligations for the development under the interpretation of the scheme section 1.5 there 's a clear delineation of the hierarchy of elements of the scheme and how they must be considered and it 's important that the strategic framework here continues to be recognized because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development such as this that is impact accessible anime I won 't go into any further detail people know there the assessment as I said that I see has been included in the agenda there 's any questions what I 'd like to do is there for our staff to speak with Mike and Steve and I 'll ask counselors they have any questions of the of yourself or of Matt or of staff but thank you all right if I could ask the Director of Planning please now speak on this Thank You Madame an um a lot of the commentary in terms of summarizing the proposals already been said by the proponent and by the submitter but just to summarize further we 've got an application or a material change of use for multiple dwelling units in total the applicants seeking 39 units comprising of 24 two bedroom units and 15 three-bedroom units as the app as the proponents as advised the site is located on the corner of Hale and Stokes route the site 's currently zoned medium density residential as was alluded to it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hale Street and falling way to will Street it presents five storeys on Howard Street which is one-story higher than the acceptable solution from a height perspective and presents 8 storeys of Wall Street the proposal as a line report has already set backs it has two access points to the site from cyst Oak Street as well as from will Street which accesses the debasement car parking during the public notification process three citizens were received in in objecting to the proposal one in support the issues raised during the public notification process was around height scale and bulk and density vehicle movements ingressing in the aggressing the site any ground moving as a result of the proposal been constructed lack of landscaping and and other design aspects future noise and amenity caused by the proposed development and any conflicts with the existing Wall Street precinct character area as well the officers have addressed all those issues as part of the report to Council the issues have been addressed and I support the officer recommendation to support the proposal subject to the conditions outlined in the report thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter yes I 'll go with councillor greeny first um I don 't know who could answer this I 'm notes on the report that there 's 82 car parks which is 15 more than what it is supposed to be which is very refreshing to see even that everyone is always concerned about parking and why was this why did this happen through the chair the proposal has been presented in that manner there 's 15 more car parks and was originally proposed that 's the decision of the proponent developer what it actually does do is alleviate some of the residents concerns in terms of car parking along high street and somebody to any residences as well so the bulk of the car parking is provided within the development sorry all of the car parks is provided within the development in excess of 15 car parks through our minimum standards but it also has a washdown car base and in that area as well so it does address it and it 's well known above and beyond our current standards for car parking well thank you I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been included Thank You mr. director thank you are any other questions councillor rider thanks part of me on page 23 it says is it it is acknowledged that existing dwellings on Hale Street will suffer a partial loss of views however right to a view is not a planning matter so where does that view live if it 's not planning through the chair resonance owners don 't owe interview unfortunately some people might purchase a block of land or a dwelling with a view doesn 't actually stop a an adjoining landowner constructing a house or another proposal that may impede on that viewers such so nothing within the planning scheme addresses view protection as such in that particular area it does address amenity in terms of streetscape in terms of the character of narrow debt cetera it doesn 't address any view protection as such and just to clarify lock number 34 that 's also looks like a business because it 's got a lemon car parks is that correct that 's a church that 's that 's next door correct can 't thank you cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes okay counselor Jacob and then councillor Maliki no yes I have a through the chair I have a question to the director it says in the conclusion whilst the proposal does not meet all of the assessment benchmarks as prescribed by the Townsville City Plan it is considered that the approval can be reasonably conditioned what 's this reasonably conditioned meaning sort of the chair as the consultant for the proponent alluded to it 's as part of his presentation the plan is seems to performance-based planning scheme so in terms of requirements around setbacks Heights and things of that nature there is existing solutions in terms of how to address them and if you meet those acceptable solutions some more of the straight straightforward matter of relation to the proposal being assess but the performance criteria allows for solutions above and beyond those acceptable solutions when considering an application and determining whether to support or or not a particular application or a proposal officers as you 'd be aware with all the reports that have come to council conditionally proposals so that they 've conditioned this this proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until all those issues that would normally come to councils as consideration yeah thank you and through the chair if this is impact assessable this particular development it 's not code assessable is it this way canceled that 's why it 's with us today because it is it is okay so if was code assessable is that the four storeys is the maximum height for this particular building through the chair if it 's if it 's code assessable will be assessed on its merits once again there 's acceptable solutions and performance criteria that that need to be addressed so we do provide for relaxations as part of the the code accessible proposal as well yeah thank you yes counselor mark could I ask you to speak off the microphone please my apologies with a based on a hill where recedes up or increases up different RL levels there which one takes precedent I feel or Daniel when you talk about maximums height maximum floors it 's really through the chat we 're so science merits because obviously we could receive a different product proposal with a slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current proposal the way that the lay of the land is it it slopes away from will sorry from Hale straight down to will Street there 's a lane way they can access the basement car park in backward Wall Street so the five story component along house rec is probably where we are assets to so the app where the planners of assess the application the impact of the eight stories is it 's very difficult to deal with just was the slope of the land [Music] so it 's just so there 's no sing provisionally assisted on its merits enemies thank you will recognize tiny boss Elizabeth yeah madam F excuse me interrupting it 's just on everybody in the room I suspect on the only person it was in the court for the first iteration of this development and the court answered that question very conclusively it was taken from the uphill side that was 18 years ago whatever was 15 years ago it 's not this particular development of that side we spent three days in court arguing exactly that point and the ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case it would be from the Hale Street entrance not the Stoke Street site so the councillor I 'll give you a very good example on Castle Hill the number of homes appear to be three-story from one side and two-story from the other so wherever the front address is for the property that is where the heart seemed taken from I think that 's easiest way to describe it is to buy it in Castle Hill generally yes but it 's really the highest point of the undisturbed land the the the difficulty with the Hale Street site as was mentioned by both submitted both people who present presented was the land has been excavated and one side of it is artificial alive the height is taken from the house street side in that location matter men yes so if that 's the case dealing with the court they 've identified that we 're really only dealing with one level above the main dated height sure India some of that is actually answered in their responses from offices to the grounds of submission so our call counselors attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reports so some of those issues have been dealt with counsel greenie yes madam mayor if this is probably a question for the if I could address it to the director about in regards to the retaining wall on page 26 so if it was existing stone pitch retaining wall it 's assumed that this wall would would need to be reconstruction with the proposed multi-dwelling structure is that does that happen in the geotechnical report and then is conditioned before building happens sort of the chances condition in regards through the proposal now as part of the condition sorry with the existing retaining wall or a new retaining wall so the conditional requiring further geotechnical studies to be undertaken and engineering studies to be undertaken as part of the file thank you that 's a clarification I was seeking thank you thank you any other questions any counsels I have one there was a geotech report on this I believe through there here it is approved land side hazard risk assessment done by ground engineering services here in Townsville so specifically it stated that this area was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you refer to the conditions of approval yeah condition 15 refers to additional wheelchair tech requirements to be undertaken yep and third the certification and engineering design as well so that will be dealt with excellent all right if there are no other questions yes counselor there was a question before about views was that from council abide in relation to her earning a bid I thought that was answered by the staff yeah but I think counselor yeah but I think the question was can you on abuse she received that okay but you can 't out of this yes if you bought a volumetric easement yes yeah but you can 't say no and yes because you can 't if you buy the property and put a volumetric gaze and you cannot afford if you don 't have the easement you don 't know that 's it you can just say that 's a bit of clarification when ironing interview thank you me thank you just going through one nail on the screen all right are there any other questions if not will someone move now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we have a seconder counselor Rider we 'll put the put the report to the vote all those in favor against carrot counselor yes you are against counselor Jacob yes I 'm against because of the debt line in the conclusion what the causal does not meet all of the assessment benchmarks is why I 'm against it I 'm not happy with the response so I asked a legal officer please to assist you cancel Jacob you need to give planning reasons as for the refusal those reasons it can 't be simply that there 's a line in the report which you disagree or don 't accept you need to address issues which are relevant to a planning decision when you 're explaining why you wishing to refuse what 's your why it 's your decision to refuse the application through the chair Tony in that line that it doesn 't meet all the assessment benchmarks is prescribed by the council City plan wouldn 't that be good enough for a reason to not want this to go through yeah a couple of things one that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is how I 'll take your question rephrase your question is non-compliance with an element of the city plan reason for refusal the answer to that is absolutely not it 's not sufficient reason the whole basis of the plan as explained by the director is that there are a whole range of alternative things and alternative solutions which may be acceptable indeed there 's been a number of decisions recently forgive me but like the name of the one I 'm trying to put my my mind around just escapes you for the moment but the court was quite critical of councillors for simply saying it doesn 't comply with the plan that 's it the the decisions of Council were a refusal for example if a refusal was recommended the council would have to detail in the report not just that there was a non-compliance but why it should be refused not Wester even though even having regard to that non-compliance for example of who was traffic there 's non-compliance to the traffic addition you 'd need to assess well what are the traffic impacts of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts unacceptable here if your example talking about hi there 's one as I understand that the will Street side is five five stories where four is acceptable there we know that the heights acceptable for now the side four stories on High Street as I understand it if your objection is about that you would need to say well it 's not just that it 's wrong not sorry it 's not just it doesn 't comply but it impacts that non-compliance impacts in these ways which are unacceptable so council from every time I have said to all the council 's when you enter the chamber you need to actually have your statements for reasons ready to go if you 're not if you 're not happy with the report and unless the staff can adequately answer those questions it 's very difficult for you to say I don 't accept this because I don 't like it there has to be a statement of reasons based on planning grounds for you to object to a report it 's really just before I ask you to comment it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber it 's what is what is required under the Local Government Act through the chair why in that instance do we have the proponent and also the objector talk to us about this if we have to come into this chamber with the predetermined outcome why do we listen to that through the chair through counselor it is what is required under the Local Government Act now if you have an issue around how your your ability to not to support an a report of council on planning you need to state it on planning grounds and all of us have been through the training and we 've all been made aware of it there are counselors and we 've done it and I 've done it myself objected to or voted against a decision of council based on a statement of reasons on planning grounds that 's all we 're asking for you to do well through the chair yes I agree but I 'd like to elaborate my answer to that one at a later date like you know very soon you know it 's a so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at objecting because of the conclusion that we 've so I will elaborate on more planning plans counselor as I said you need people need to be prepared when they enter the chamber all right look for the process I can only advise you counselor there is a responsibility for you to understand the planning scheme of council to go through these reports there 's opportunity for you to speak to the staff prior to this to seek clarification now I can 't I 'm not here to direct you but to advise you you forget it is that you must have a statement of reasons for your for your vote to be registered I will propose it thank you madam it thank you cancer all right the item one is carry will now move to item 2 which is the MCU for a service station in car wash could I ask someone to call counsel the door back into the room please all right if I could ask the director please to provide us with some background information Thank You Man item 2 relates to is seeking three approvals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service station and car wash the second aspect is a reconfiguration of a lot so they 're seeking to subdivide one load into two and the third aspect there is regarding operational works seeking approval for advertising on the site the site 's located on the corner of Mount Lowe Parkway and linwood avenue in mount Lowe sorry Englishman Beach the sights companies zone low-density residential and hence the proposal triggers an impact assessable development during the public notification period counts loss has received 124 submissions the breakdown of that was 119 were in support of the proposal and five submissions received were objecting to the proposal the issues raised as a result of the objections included traffic issues access and egress to the site location relation to the bus stops air quality noise light the environment and question the need for the proposal in the locality the issues have been addressed by the council officers report in detail council officers are recommending approval of all three aspects of the proposal subject to conditions and I provided table the officer recommendation to consideration thank you all right is there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is anyone wishing to speak on this matter or have any questions for the director yes councillor Jacob yes madam a through the chair look I 've always been for this proposal but in going in this change of from residential to commercial I just like to ask a couple of questions one is there is commercial entities existing down long alternate drive next to the coals establishment are any of these commercial internet parcels of land has that been investigated for this particular service station now the reason I ask that is because my main concern for this service station now even though I do admit that there 's over a hundred for this and there 's about four or five against this this is in my division I just wanted to know the parking issue that we 've got that part of bushland Beach has been operational for school school kids on buses and there 's a bus terminus there and I know that the mums and dads and the grandparents Park on this particular lot of land to go and pick their kids up is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that people can actually access the bus stop and pick the kids up because that 's one of my main concerns there 's a couple aspects for a couple of questions raised in councillor Jacobs commentary the first is in relation to the site itself the proponent has chosen the site we don 't necessarily have a huge involvement in terms of which the site that the proponent wants to develop the service station and the the car wash shop on it so we receive the application and which is obligated to assess the application in relations with suitability on the site and that 's what council offices have done in relation to car parking there is a commentary within the report in relation to the general public using private land for car parking it 's it 's not intended hasn 't been identified if you prefer car parking are now on or ever it 's a private bit of land the fact that people have they have had the opportunity to use it before their car parking benefits has probably been an opportune ability to do so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops aliens if there 's two bus stops one on Lynwood Drive and level on on Mount load Parkway that will be retained and so access to tip to those bus stops will be retained as well yeah thank you and through the chair it also brings into question and I read in the reports that the roundabout itself the single line roundabout which accesses into Cole 's off Matt Loeb Parkway and into linwood avenue has council envisage that and I did read the other report that 's come through have they envisage that this is going to be a problem with it 's this particular service station and the access into and out of affecting that roundabout through the chair my understanding is that there 's a traffic report that 's been submitted as part of proposal so all the traffic engineering and parking has been addressed as part of that consideration thank you thank you any other questions councillor cook I just threw the chair for the director and may well be already answered in this traffic report this is forthcoming on page 63 on an outlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which way the two ways is that gonna be a solid and raised or just paint it on the road that 's part of the operation so I agree so I have to sorry the party operational works they 're seeking at this point in time this in relation to the signage only not a man and any further works required as part of any upgrades to the road treatment whatever else it would be further application but I might seek guidance from my planning staff to see if they 've got any further advice relation to that could you speak up please so that will allow trucks to drive around there and over that wouldn 't it if it was just painted it 's a painted meeting [Music] I think I know where counselor coops going it 's the fact that being painted doesn 't prevent people from turning right and ignoring it and I that is I have that issues in a very very similar access egress area in my division there where cars have where they 're turning right into it just short of the the roundabouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single lane cars behind them are collecting them so I just thought just pernoding if possible maybe included just to save maybe a bit of headaches later on this is talking from experience it 's walk but they 're out of town yes Richard just one more question to to the director I believe the the input and output of this service station has changed over time can you tell me to get into the service station is only viral in word and to get out of the service station is either to come to the roundabout the ones currently not being used to Lynwood or to access Mantlo Parkway will this affect the traffic flow in the busy times coming into MATLAB Parkway which can intend to that Lionel Turner roundabout which can get quite heavy so traffic coming down over the hill on Mount lo Parkway will it impact on that if a lot of people turn to go into the servo to the bank up of traffic on that particular road and I did read the traffic report but it wasn 't in that did that particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of items in as part of the question there as well as it relates to access of linwood avenue as well as mental Parkway my understanding is that access can be obtained access can be obtained of linwood avenue as well as left in from maillot parkway and similar regress would be left out like pathways as well as using that roundabout treatment on on linwood avenue in relation to the the car parking analysis or sort of the traffic analysis only would have considered that and how counsel engineers would have determined its it 's an acceptable solution in relation to the traffic movements around a particular area okay thank you Tom Thank You councillor Maliki no all right mr. director just the question we come out onto Mount lo Parkway they are notice we 've got a runoff lane going in would it not be prudent to look at oh no the bus stop is closed there but for merging purposes cuz we now know we all good we are at merging whether we have some sort of mercy delay in coming back onto me at low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair I have to seek for further engineering advice on that in terms of the designers can provide some advice in that space emerging lane so form a Mattamy is that something that we could keep open into the future to look at if the capacity increases coming out on to there as a some sort of condition if if we do a traffic count lane it becomes a problem can we then impose that condition well no I 'm sure we can do many things director through the chain you have to impose that condition now anticipating what the traffic volumes might actually be so you require them to operate that intersection or whatever treatments we see yeah any other questions I have a couple mr. director firstly the the roundabouts that are currently there what size vehicle are we expecting to do petrol deliveries because one thing I didn 't see is whether or not the vehicles will be able to get around the roundabouts efficiently without running them over through the cherub had to seek further apart from a planning officers we don 't so this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan for these vehicles to enter and exit the the service station because I couldn 't see one on the report what I saw was a traffic impact assessment report but I 'm please tell me where the page is where it talks about these vehicles entry and exit because the majority of them tend to be on main thoroughfares most of our service stations that have easy clearance for these vehicles this one isn 't so alright because I 've seen in the past significant damage done to council roads by these sort of vehicles not having a proper Manek traffic management plan and if it 's coming in from mouth low road then it would have to turn left out of mouth low road so then how would it get back through to back up to the highway yes thank you Bujji come forward pull and speak up please can I ask because for us for myself that 's an important aspect to this because this is a fuel service station that is not on a main thoroughfare one of the reasons the proponent has brought it forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this now this is on council this is on a road that is typically not used to carrying that size vehicle so I would have liked to have seen that in the report yes council first what you 're saying on page 62 one of the dot points says medium rigid vehicles all larger trucks including refuse collection involve feeling so once you get about medium rigid it goes to semi-trailer so yeah it 's almost it isn 't if you open your door but there will be an issue because it won 't be able to get around the Lynwood roundabout and if it comes in off the map low Parkway will wind up with damage on our assets very rigid all right so that comes back to whether or not we condition it for a sized vehicle so I might ask our director of infrastructure the sort of vehicles really because this isn 't just a once-off this is going to be a continuous delivery on council Road assets can you tell me in your opinion looking at this what would be a more a size suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to look at the deliveries that would happen in this situation obviously the fuel tankers and the size of those at the roundabout so I would have expected that our model would have probably been done to assess that to determine the size of the roundabout and we have issue around existing pedestrian crossings and footpath to be redesigned part of the problem we have is we do have a skate park in a park across the road and there 's a tendency for kids let 's be honest too take the shortest possible route across hope we considered conditioning this to ensure that there are there is and we 've done it around the the Murray sporting complex to place pull fencing to prevent people from cutting across through roundabouts so they have to use pedestrian proper pedestrian pathways to get to and from through the chair there 's no conditional relating to that at this point in time but it 's something we can actually include as a condition counselors is there an appetite to include that put Councilwoman thank you madam a look there was heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and planning on the pending committee and the pedestrian trapped several times in relation to public safety yes I said the outside is a big appetite to make sure that pedestrians and this was heavily protected because we talked about people walking their dogs kids go from the shopping center to the service station bus pop interaction was quite I suppose dynamic in that space for the one a bit of a better description yep but yeah I think this is great appetite for that alright so we 'll look to out that and that 's all I had on this one one other thing in light of the the the fact that this is being placed predominantly this site was actually councillors on our planning scheme noted to be for residential purposes there has to be a statement of reasons which the staff have provided to overturn the planning scheme to allow this to occur so I hope you have gone through that it is quite the report is quite good however in terms of the operational works I 'd like to see this one come back to Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at things such as the concrete medium in the driveways and an actual understanding of the traffic management plan for the vehicles that will service and provide fuel and other things to the service station so with your indulgence we 'll move to add a few extra conditions and one of them being that the operational works come back to Council for approval works the building code we can still prove the development application okay presentation has been added to the operational works that 's appropriate yes however a decision one way or the other in relation to the other two the development application will love it either needs to be made today or it would be deferred until I feel like so what I am suggesting is we move through the development application and seek for the operational works then to come back to Council for review and to ensure all the matters we 've requested are dealt with ok council Walker madam ed do we have to itemize what we requested them yes because we lose thank you so in terms of the director mr. director yes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting regarding a the commercial development on Harvey range Road and I think we had a similar discussion in relation to that where Council approved the development subject conditions but there was a second element it 's called Part B of the the council recommendation that said future operational works regarding transport the transport management plan pedestrian access whatever else can be included as part of that second L that comes back to Council for consideration yep alright so however I think the pedestrian movement we would have to include that as part of the development approval yes all right it 's just a second element which we get as further operational works being the pedestrian movements are the access Arrangements the and the the mediumship arrangements come back together producing consideration all right if we can include that please and I 'll be guided by Obama as well i additionally conditions regarding traffic management plan very heavy very heavy vehicle movement heavy vehicle Menace or a suitable vehicle movements suitable suitably sized vehicle movements access egress arrangements on mount low parkway medium strip treatment on mantlet pipeline median treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yep and the next element would be the the fencing yes baccala dress the different issues counselors here you happy experience and part b of that element would be that future operational works for that item come back to councils consideration part b of so i think that could be incorporated as part of the overall conditioning at the of the approval yeah part b which would be separate to it saying future operational works for those elements come back to council for its consideration a big require thank you councils are you happy with that yes thank you me yes excellent all right yes cancel monkey money yeah just a question I just wanted to confirm from my page the servo we 're just looking at page 53 item five I just want to ensure that we have sufficient screening behind the service station because I 'm correct me if I 'm wrong the remainder of the land will be still residential Sanders are they talking about noise abatement yeah and also visual amenity plans yes so make sure we 've got a proper buffer condition didn 't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent fences from being graffiti 'd hedges are very good all right so are we talking page 53 landscaping conditions so the operational work should include a landscaping plan yeah so for the landscaping plan to be part of the operational works for us we 'll be required to come back to to Council for approval thank you all right excuse me madam I just threw the chair I 'm 10 you might wish to fix the medium treatment to have liked median treatment as opposed to medium medium and thank you all right counselors so that 's in addition to the approvals all right counselors can I have mover Thank You counselor Jacob the second er counselor walk up all those in favor against carried so we are now through item 2 it 's gonna be a long day all right item 3 is the planning appeal it 's fairly straightforward any issues that 's for know yep through the chair would recommend items 3 4 5 the move together because they 're all for noting the first two in relation to outcomes of Appeals and the fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response for noting regarding the home-based business at nine precipitant quartic Irwin excuse me madam mayor further to that as per the council agenda I have a conflict of interest on item five as my sister and brother-in-law reside at seven crisp and Court so we move three and fall together for no beans have someone move that we note those reports thank you moved councillor Mulkey no second of council array by all those in favor against carries unanimously I 'll now look at moving item five separately so councillor greeny if you wish to vacate so can I have someone move that we note item five Thank You counsel Walker seconded by Councillor Doyle any comments yes madam mayor probably a comment about I just wonder flag I think it 's time to and after listening to the presentation from mr. Brennan as I think we need to have a good look at our home based businesses and really start to think about what people are doing in their home and are they really home-based businesses because I think that 's more and more people are staying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just want to flag that matter meth okay council what you noting there is that some home-based businesses aren 't moving a growing beyond being a home-based business that 's correct and it 's unfair for the other businesses that have to pay for bricks and mortar rates and I 'll continue yes I agree and that 's something that we 'll also have issues in terms of the way the State Planning Act is written around home-based businesses will note those comments if there are no others will put item five to the boat we have a mover and seconder all those in favor against carried unanimously could I just ask if we could bring council greenie back in and we 'll move on to item six there is a speaker if I could ask for a Elizabeth Poole come forward Richard just to clarify a bullet Elizabeth 's speaking to item seven not item six are my apologies item seven sorry I 'm will move through to item 6 which is the resolution of our local government infrastructure thank you and if I can mr. director do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make this really simple it 's just an update of our existing eligible it 's just been updated through consultation through the community but also through various agencies thank as part of executive summary they refer to economic development Queensland the UDI a and D TMR who provided input a public consultation process the modifications that have been proposed one are in relation to the the lower growth rate we 've been expecting experiencing ism as a result of development in the area but also identifies various infrastructure whether it 's pipes in various areas and just the the resizing of those and they 're identified in dock points as part of the executive summary it 's just a an annual review of our current eldership we 're hoping to do a more detailed review in line with a I guess if you 're planning in review as well thank you it 's fairly straightforward are there any questions for the director yes from student council Jacob yeah I 'm through the chair it 's in attachment number one the LG IP interim amendment 2019 just on that table one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a clarification on our plan for sanctum West and Sanctum going by Espenson is it a state government responsibility or is going to be one of the council 's responsibilities for the future can I just confirm you did say six point one that was the submissions made yes yes the submissions made in considered yes was the one that you through the chair might just refer that to Tara no one replied from advice on that matter yes certainly [Music] the discussions we had with the Department of Main Roads identified that there is a condition of approval on the st. of West 's development mm-hmm that requires them to do upgrading works to connect to the amount load and the highway and there is a rationale placed on that at which time they need to need to do those words they 're submitting identified that that 's fresh hold is pretty well reached already and they have been subsequent to this mister being made there have been amendments to those conditions negotiated with the developer to extend those fresh holders so there 's no there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from West area is outside our priority infrastructure area so we don 't undertake to plan for that development we don 't really plan time to take infrastructure to support any developments outside priority infrastructure area so the condition of approval puts the onus on the developer to provide that connection yeah thank you very much thank you any other questions council I know sorry okay all right so this is to ensure dot the local government infrastructure plan are there any other questions of councils or I can have someone move that we accept this thank you cancel maliki no seconded counselor qu all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you we 'll now move on to item 7 which is the planning scheme amendment at Landsdowne sorry Elizabeth if you could come forward please my apologies my name is Elizabeth Paul and I speak to you today as a landowner and resident of Woodstock council I thank the council for this opportunity to speak with you today regarding the planting scheme amendment at Lansdowne station calcium I know that the Woodstock Action Group has been denied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere eleven weeks ago council notified Woodstock residents the council intends on rezoning lands down from rural to high-impact industrial this has been met with widespread community outrage given the significant off-site adverse impacts which are by definition likely as a result of heavy industry being placed at Lansdowne now given the unanimous voice of the community protesting the development location will counsel listen to their constituents acknowledge that they do not have the mandate to go ahead with the Lansdowne amendment and provide jobs and growth in a safer more appropriate location the Lansdowne site sits atop both the Rothstein catchment and the Horton River catchment I note that there have been amendments to the amendments and we have not had time to peruse them as they were only released to the public today the rostam catchment contains the Lansdowne Creek a very significant feeder Creek for the Roskam these sensitive receptors render the lands down site dangerously inappropriate for high-impact industry the only environmental report conducted on this site admits and I quote that a comprehensive environmental assessment was not attempted the protection of groundwater resources from industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be done the responses that counsel do not have the time or all the money to do them Council does not have the sufficient information required in order to make an informed decision on whether this amendment should be proceeding instead counsel is risking adding to the radius of pollution which is increasingly surrounding Council in light of councils obligation to comply with Bell Cara legislative requirements for transparency integrity and accountability the Townsend wider community is asking the question why Lansdowne and not more suitable and ready to use precincts such as the town 's estate development area or TST a council needs to make the right decisions for the right reasons in November ask Muriel given the significant level of risk associated with high impact industry at Lansdowne how does she plan to protect the people of Townsville in the event of contaminants polluting the rough and catchment and the response was go and read the background reports I have and I stand by my original question the design of the rostam and the current water treatment infrastructure means that tousle would not be able to cope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter written by Council which contains council 's own admission that this development poses an unacceptable risk to sensitive receptors such as residential dwellings in the towns the city plan it clearly states a preferred location in North Queensland for the establishment of industrial development of regional state and national significance is the tsta not Lansdowne in fact it states that Lansdowne is the least preferred option I table the Townsville land-use proposal the strategies report I refer Council to the council industrial land use finals to study final report are at 2011 which says and I quote in determining the priorities for the development of Woodstock consideration should be given to whether there is land available elsewhere to meet the specified criteria and there is a table the tousle state development area development scheme November 2019 the state government is accelerating development of and they and releasing the TST eyesight to add to the almost 1,000 hectares currently available and ready for use then releases will have appropriate development footprint which mitigates concerns which have already been raised by counsel regarding the site there is no demonstrated need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MP Merrill candidate Sam are all opposed to the rezoning of the Lansdowne site as they too know that jobs and growth can be safely achieved at the tsta or a different location but not at Landsdowne I 've written to Minister Cameron dick requesting an urgent meeting to discuss this matter again thank you for the opportunity to speak today and I call on all councillors to put your constituents first do not resign lands down to high impact industry where heavy water heavy industry would sit astride or atop my children 's drinking water your children 's drinking water and to counsels children 's drinking water [Applause] thank you I will now ask the director please to bring forward the report and advise of some of the changes thank you madam man um just to provide a bit of background to the proposed plan aslim amendment we are looking to rezone or recommend to rezone the land from rural part rule to part high impact industry but to provide that a context to it and in terms of part of the history and when it 's been previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official rezoning or prett to commence from the official rezoning back in July 2017 we resolved to commence the process and refer the matter to the state government consideration in November 2017 Council officers met with relevance a couple agencies whole-of-government approach just to make sure that all the relevant background investigation study was needed to be undertaken during December 2017 through to May 20 19 council officers prepared the relevant planning scheme amendment as well as all the relevant background studies that were required as part of the initial consultation with the state government agencies at that same time who was referred back to council to consideration it was referred seeking a state interest review from June to October 20 1918 turists reviewers undertaken and we received advice back from the state government to allow to enable the engl the planners give amendment to be put on public notification on public consultation from November through to December 2019 for a period of 35 days the public consultation commenced and we are now tabling the results of that public consultation over that 35 business they P read [Music] to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scale of environmental studies that are unneeded at the rezoning stage versus what 's what 's going to be provided and what 's required further down the track all the environmental requirements all the background studies requirements came came as a result of the state interest review and consultation relevant state government agencies so there 's a level of environmental investigations that need to be undertaken at the rezoning stage being mindful that the rezoning stage isn 't the the file on all albeit end of the process there 's still quite a few planning applications that need to come back for consideration for Council they include the subdivision of the land in terms of the LOC reconfiguration there 's going to be further environmental investigations engineering require investigations required as part of that process further the next stage of that will be a development application process so each habit development will be assessed on its merits and further environment investigations will be need to be undertaken depending on the the magnitude and the potential impact of each of those developments so they range from anything from a a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant or something of that nature and all the relevant more detailed environment of Investigations need to be undertaken as part of that DEA process but there 's also further operational environmental investigations that need to be undertaken when that proposal needs to be licensed through the relevant government state government agencies as well given the the nature of the the high impact industries zoning it might actually create interest in other types of industry coming to the area and they in turn will have their own planning process and they might even trigger an EIS which is an environmental impact assessment required for the site the scale of environmental studies required for that type of use is massive and and we 're talking about a plethora of environmental studies engineering report and other studies to justify their proposal beyond that we still require further operational works even after that da process so there 's still a lot of a lot more approvals that need to be obtained beyond the rezoning process there 's still a plethora and a huge magnitude of more detailed environmental investigations that need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first stage of the whole planning approvals process and the background studies and environmental studies undertaken for the rezoning stage are suitable at this point in time for the planning amendment as provided and as authorized by the the state up through the state interest review process so I just wanted to provide that context in relation to where we find ourselves at this point in time there 's still a long way to go and even the decision that councils making today is simply to refer the application to the state to the minister or approval to allow to be adopted so there 's still another approval that needs to be obtained as part of that process just wanted to highlight the consultation process we 've just gone through as well from a legislative statutory perspective we 'll require to publicly notify and consult for a period of 20 business days council went beyond that we went for a period of 35 business days from the legislative process were required to provide a public notice in the paper provide a hard copy at councils front customer service center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic copy of the planning scheme amendment itself Council and its officers went above and beyond that we did a massive bailout to the surrounding areas we ended up sending up some of the order about 472 letters to the Lansdowne and surrounding areas including maringá Woodstock Majors Creek calcium and Reed River background studies which we don 't always do we don 't necessarily do we 're all provider on the website so people could actually go on our website and download all the relevant environmental and background studies council organized to meet the planner sessions which were held on this on Saturday 30th November and Saturday Saturday the 7th of December of which 70 people registered and took the time of councilors council offices to ask the relevant questions in addition to that we provided hard copies at those meet the planner sessions so people could actually sit down and go through the relevant background studies and the the plan is the amendment itself in addition to that council offices provided some of the order of over a hundred USBs and within those USBs we had all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment or what it proposes the plans associated with that in addition to that we we established information sheets we establish fa Q 's to preempt what some of the questions might be to provide some clarity in terms of what the plan is the amendment process was going to provide and in addition to that to make life easier for the constituents wanting to make submissions we provided some boxes at meet the plan sessions where people could write out their submissions and and put them in the boxes so it was a pretty comprehensive process undertaken for this planning C amendment and would probably haven 't gone through such a comprehensive process in the past so we went above and beyond for this particular process as a result will receive 269 submissions of which 265 of those submissions were objected to the proposal and four were supporting the development of those 269 submissions 262 came from individuals 7 came from groups and organizations of those 269 submissions 153 were considered to be unique ie people went out of the way and actually provided submissions individually whereas about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers have done a lot of work reviewing all the submissions and as you can see an attachment one they 've gone through and considered every submission that was made they 've summarized them into groups where where similar items were raised ie water quality etc and they 've provided counsel with a very comprehensive review and response to all the submissions made just to summarize and these are just the top seven or eight submissions or issues raised the issues raised as part of the process included potential emissions and hazardous activities impacting on nearby residents and in properties potential trap transport impacts environmental issues flood and water quality impacts groundwater infrastructure and loss of agricultural land all these issues have been addressed and summarized by council offices as part of attachment 1 after reviewing the submissions council officers are recommending to proceed with the rezoning however with various changes to the original scope of the planning amendment they 're looking to implement further environmental provisions as part of planning scheme which will address landscaping water quality noise vibration which will address a lot of the issues that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area is currently affected by the by an overlay in relation to the the Ross River Dam catchment as part of the rezoning map that went out it was proposed to rezone part of that land a high impact industry as part of the consideration some of the issues raised as part of the submission process councillors are now recommending that that portion which is affected by the overlay be retained as a rule so so we don 't actually encourage any high impact as part of that area the amended maps are presented for consideration as part of the council report in addition to that council offices have started a trying to take a water quality assessment of the groundwater the area so we can actually have a baseline of the ground water quality for that particular area and we can monitor that if there 's any impact as a result of any future development whether it 's industry or other uses in the in that particular area so we 're gonna have a baseline in terms of what the current ground water quality is and if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the baseline was as of as if currently is now as opposed to trying to find out that information later down the trunk councilors have reviewed all the submissions made and they are recommended to council to proceed with the rezoning subject to the changes outlined in the council report thank you are there any questions for the director please on this matter councillor Jacob through the chair of the 269 submissions against this proposal how many of those submissions in the councils we are changing a few of the things were adopted like you know by the council in other words did they satisfy the majority of those people through their chairs very difficult to actually answer that question without going back to the the proponents or the submitters there were some medicine and even talking to some of the community that attended they make the planner sessions that they just I want to say that the Industrial Development out there regardless of the type and form so from a from an officer perspective we believe we 've done the best innovation to addressing some of those issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around some of the environmental issues and some of the engineering issues to address future development however that 's not gonna peace sectors of the community that just don 't want to see that type of development dependent that in that area and through the chair do we take that into consideration the fact we 've got all those submitters against this proposal and most of those submitters actually live out in that area of Woodstock and that sort of thing do we actually take that into consideration with your final amendments that you 've made set the table process we do take it in consideration in from a planning perspective Antonis issues raised as part of the submission but from an elected representative perspective you guys should familiarize yourself with all the submissions raised as part of attachment 1 and make that decision as well but to provide a bit of background and context to it the land 's been identified for a future industrial investigation area for long time it 's been identified as part of the strategic framework for council as part of this planning scheme it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts Queensland regional plan is a future industrial area it 's been identified as part of the city deals consideration in terms of that area for industrial purposes in any future infrastructure upgrades along Flinders Highway so it 's been identified for as a strategic industrial area through various forms that are at a state federal and local government level yeah if I can I might ask the CEO who sits on the Townsville interstate develop an industrial development board pleased to make some comment just to clarify a number of points that were raised the Townsville State Development Board that it is it might need to come closer to you in closing can you hear me now um it doesn 't sound any different to me thank you yeah Townsville State Development Board that includes myself and state government members as well as a number of other independent individuals and people such as Renae Crosby from the port just in relation to the development of that land where that currently stands is the in the coordinated general is the authority in relation to the development of that land the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of handed to a particular proponent and and of course I can 't speak in relation to who that proponent is however the proponent has at this stage not identified specifically the type of developments that were going to be on that 500 hectares in fact at the last board meeting what was agreed to was that the board would look at engaging an external organization to do a study of potential proponents in relation to that land and the floodplain issues that are associated with that land so at this point only 500 hectares have been identified as a section of land of interest to a particular proponent as to what developments are going to happen on that land no decisions have been made on that yet and could be months away before those decisions are made and so two different developments Lansdowne has been part of the process here for a considerable period of time and predates a number of people and is an accepted component as a part of the council estate development and understood the daddies councils land as opposed to the state land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is available for development can I just confirm with you however CEO that the vast majority of land identified near the port is well below acceptable standards and is a floodplain and will take considerable time that 's what we I thought we 've been advised so it could be up to ten years before that land is available for development I can 't confirm whether it 's ten years or not madam mayor but a substantive quantum of that land falls within that category all right sorry through the chair can I just clarify years ago this land was identified as a potential land that could possibly attract industry yes if I could the land was purchased around 2001 2002 was based around the sales of council land that was part of the then Riverside Gardens development because that was land owned by Council it was identified by state development that there wasn 't suitable land for development of industry in Townsville so the careers Inc site was the last of counts suitable council owned land prior to the purchase of this site and I note the council Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchase of land Stan in 2002 so I mean me I was on council I wasn 't directly involved in the purchase thing then the thought was because we had attracted Korea 's Inc there were a number of other heavy industries State Development had originally identified the land but had chosen not to buy the land and had suggested to the then to Council that they should look at purchasing the site they had done some of the initial studies and I believe that 's correct mr. blye so it had been identified at the time council mapped it as strategic in its strategic framework as future industry and as we 've been moving through there is no extensive suitable areas for industry development so very much is crunch time about the future of the city I the staff I 've asked the staff to carefully go through because obviously we do want to protect waterways and things like that and I believe that they 've been able to change the mapping on this area I am a little perturbed that we haven 't included the environmental corridors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlay but once you look at that over overlay there 's only specific areas where industry will be able to go so correct through the chair the map that you refer to was identified as part of the background studies in terms of where the environmental corridors and areas of environmental significance were to be protected the reason hasn 't been included as part of rezoning is the difficulty in relation to having dual zones and in relation to future development will survey exactly where that line on the map is had a more detailed level than what it currently is required that had a planning scheme amendment stage thank you so there are only set areas along this site where industry will be able to go because of those restrictions as part of the overlays Council are there any councillors who want to make a comment at the moment councillor Doyle madam chair just wanting to be crystal clear that information was publicly available around the strategic or long-term strategic intent of the Lansdowne area so it 's not something that 's just been I know that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it has it been clearly identified as long-term future industry publicly identified I mean I know you 've got to pick up the document and read it but it 's been a publicly identifiable piece of information been in the documents for quite some time my second question and point for clarification would it be fair to say that this is a very long term process is first step where it 's the timeframe just for this step if you could through the chair it 's difficult to actually ascertain exactly the timing for it so from a rezoning perspective if council decides to support proceeding with the scheme amendment it gets referred to the to the minister unfortunately we can 't control the timing in relation to how we 're gonna get a response back it could be weeks it could be months it could be longer relation to it they might require further studies so it 's unknown relation to exactly the timing for it but it 's the first stage of a very long process as so even if the state and ministers support the rezoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of a scheme amendment in the next two months potentially a little bit longer but the DA process to these the subdivision process the operational works process and all the relevant approvals actually do that as well as all the environmental studies that each of those developments need to undertake to support their development we 're talking years really and so probably that 's the point I 'm sort of trying to get at this is step one of a very long rigorous process by no means says that something is going to happen it just I suppose starts the thought process of thinking that way correct so if someone was to present to Council today to do a development on the site they would have to go through the same process driver did which was a material change of use impact accessible and they would need to provide studies based around environmental water traffic road noise there 's a whole range of things I would have to do so and I 'm also one more question sorry madam mayor I note from Elizabeth 's presentation there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 've spoken about estate development land and the fact that there 's so much of it that can 't be used and years away from that perspective can you give us a more conversational kind of stuff talk more about the potential with the baseline informational gathering of baseline information around the quality of water now so mr. director do you want to highlight that as part of this amendment there 's a couple of items there from a water quality perspective it 's not intended that any development on site uses groundwater it needs to be connected to two council water so there 's a huge infrastructure investment required to actually service the site so all future development have to use council water is such that and not impact on the groundwater as part of the environmental studies undertake they need to better take on the future development it 's going to be an overriding concern that there is no impact whether it 's through any of their operational practices any impact on the groundwater the reason we 're looking trying to take a waterpot lay assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point in time to actually determine what the quality of the water what the condition and the amount of water that 's in the ground war at this point in time and we 'll monitor that and as a result a future development just to make sure that there 's no future impact on the quality of the groundwater in the area can I ask mr. director you 're not just referring to the council site are you making this offer we 're making this offer to all adjoining land holders in the area created so what I 've asked the staff to do is to look at the groundwater not just of the land stand site but to offer to do groundwater testing for all adjacent land holders to ensure that we have a baseline for what the current water quality is on those on those properties and that way then we can ensure that we have the base level so that 's something normally we do do we we pay for that that 's at our cost we pay for all those water testings to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this process and we 'll get sorry will they then go to the residents will the residents get the results through the chair we can make that available but it really is for us to monitor what the what any potential impacts might be of future and Ducks work Velma but I think that 's important we make them currently available because if there are issues with the groundwater currently I think the residents would like to know so yeah so there you go um yes counselor if I may madam me do we have a concrete proponent who 's definitely going to build on that site at the moment or do we have some interested parties because I 'll leave that to the director to answer through the three chair that that there 's two interested parties that I 'm aware up on that side but there 's still a long process for them to go through in terms of their own feasibilities and their own environmental investigations so from purely from a planning perspective we have yet to receive a development occasion for any proposals on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um so when we talk about off-site impacts they 're based on something that may not happen yet we 're going to proponents talking about coming out and building a battery plant I mean we can 't jump forward and look at those issues but they will be dealt with in their in in the later later works package but my main concern is if if we lose this because I know I know this is a very important project and there will be other places that will be circling around trying to get this battery plant into their communities to look after the jobs so I guess we it 's important that we we consider all these I guess potential potential impacts that we 're coming but they 'll be done at a later stage and we 'll make sure that we drilled right down into those to make sure it 's done properly what will have to happen is whoever whoever decides to tell me like come to town all right they they seek to come on sites they will be required to do a full development application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be required to do a whole range of studies or to ensure that their their impact on the site is minimized and moment for my there 's talk of open and accountable in Bell Cara legislation is there any process during this process that we haven 't been open and accountable because from what I understand we 've gone way above what the Act actually regulates us to do so I 'm just I know it 's easy to throw that stuff around but I just want to know where is there someplace that we 've fallen over on that no but I 'd comment that the state members particularly because the regional plan goes to the last eight member for a comment the fact that there was no comment and the claim now that he doesn 't support this I think is quite hypocritical and have any state member come out now and say something or even a federal member when there are processes that they would be a part of in their own chambers and not to have said anything there and then to take a populist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is appalling yes council Walker madam mayor that in these submissions here there was a couple of things we looked at the issue and heavily interrogated the ground water issue and there 's commitment to do the testing and getting a baseline so we know what 's here now and what if there 's any issues moving forward if in the event something is built there because this process here is just the zoning there 's no application that 's been approved for any building whatsoever that 's a separate process all together so if a meatworks wants to go there tomorrow that 's the pan application as an MCU but it 's not zoned but if it 's owned then it goes for an application process under high impact industries the there 's one and there 's a couple in here about the reason the acquisition of land for road works and taking a ball bore away this is outside our footprint some of the director give us some got some commentary around this because it blurs the lines in relation to who owns a road network how that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report about around access into this site but it 's only a sort of a one idea of many because we 've seen this happen on the Ring Road what they talk about the start is not what you get at the end so could chop and change just want to get some commentary around that in this chamber please mr. director if you could comment on that through the chair as part of the documentation that was put out as part of the background studies there was information that was provided by DTM our as part of the infrastructure analysis that showed a concept that may require Lander a position to provide access to the site that 's a very preliminary concept plan at this point in time this needs to be a lot more discussions consultation with DTM are they need to review all the possible options in relation to accessing the site whether it 's directly on that location or further up the Flinders Highway or further down Filner 's highway there 's still a long way to go and if there is going to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gonna be in consultation with the affected landowner and in discussion around what compensation will look like and if it 's affecting someone 's ball it might be relocation or reinstatement of Oldboy elsewhere but that 's pre-empting what may happen in the future and what that access design looks like in the future thank you throw the questions yeah just just for the record we 're not at any stage from here I mean looking at any acquisitions of land we 're not interested in it 's nothing to do with us it 's it 's another state government apartment yeah correct thank you I just want to point out in the in the attachment that will go to the community there is a draft map figure one five six of the lands down concept plan and that shows the rest of the environmental upon me the environmental corridors that are to be protected and I think once people see there they will see the the level the amount of land that is truly available and it 's it 's there are significant environmental corridors that are deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number two it says provide the consultation report to each person who made a properly made solution are you saying that now will provide them with that map and everything after the if when we go through this process if the amendment is approved to go to the next stage to the minister these reports are then made public and people will be able to see what what the final outcome was from the staff okay councillor Jacob thank you yeah through the chair after listening to all the argument here can you tell me what the benefits are to council considering the fact that once these applications start coming in for this rezone land for industrial uses that we 're going to have to provide all the infrastructure has council costed a possible future you know cost to the ratepayers of this infrastructure going out to an area of Woodstock and and not considering an area that is on our doorstep for these things in the state development area have we considered that cost and what 's the benefit to us of this particular change it really is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that site whether its water whether it 's two in relation to upgrades of the the road network long term the highway to access the site that the costs of that from my understanding isn 't going to be borne by the but by the ratepayers by the resident if there 's still a lot of discussions that need to be undertaken whether it 's through city deals and through the steak oven the federal government to actually find find the monies for that infrastructure as well as the proponents proponents need to be responsible for the cost recovery of providing that infrastructure to that side as well thank you so the bulk of it should be borne by the proponent through the chair the first part of that was the benefit to to the community if successful and and if the episode of if the subdivision the estate is is successful the economic benefit back to the communities is significant from from a job suspected from from an economic perspective my employment perspective all right yes you know just briefly councillors in relation to the comments around the bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact there were two expressions of interest that were advertised in all the media as is required in relation to Lansdowne which included maps and locations that is to gauge the interest of any industry that may be wanting to come they were run by this organization were in the media there have been a number of media releases innovation to the interest in Lansdowne the original purchase of the land happened some definitely predates me but happened some 16 years ago and through that process but the most important one can I repeat the fact that the regional development plan that was available to all was clearly a part of identifying lens down and the Woodstock areas so I I guess just to deal with the issue that there 's been no secrecy around this in fact the identification that that land happened 16 years ago it 's been in numerous plans since then including the regional development plan and and so I struggled with the idea of a lack of transparency relations alright if there are any further comments or discussion councillor qu thank you madam mayor I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's important that the community engaged with these decisions and to hear from you directly was very important so I thank you for that and for the other residents who are here today to listen to all of our discussions it 's these decisions are not ones that we take lightly and we interrogate them and interrogate them and interrogate them and we 'll continue interrogating and that we have to balance those decisions with other factors one of the statements that Elizabeth made which I did want a question was the Woodstock group that we 're not allowed to present today can somebody tell me whether that 's correct yes can I call on the acting chief legal officer please thank you yeah see ya my understanding is that the there was a an arrangement for a presentation to be made and as I understand it and it 's peripheral I 've got a second hint because I understand it at a very late stage there was an advice that no there will be we wish to make and I believe it was by that stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't it wasn 't a denial that 's my knowledge I beg your pardon there 's to my knowledge it wasn 't there was no pre arrangement of two separate presentations I 've misunderstood there I think that 's the great case in support of the CLO we did and I agree with you and we think it was but in a timely matter Elizabeth contacted the organization requesting the opportunity and and we provided that opportunity at a later date and and and I wasn 't part of it but my understanding is that last Friday we received a request from another individual to speak at this meeting as well it was explained that the normal process and based on council policy is seven days notice in relation to a presentation which is something that everyone else has met and you 've seen a number of presentations here today we did also receive notice that at some point from Elizabeth Paul that she in fact was not representing and and I acknowledge that and thank you for that notice but again that was towards the end of last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denying them the opportunity it was a matter of the lateness thank you very much saying I wish to behave you can you could leave the chain both on Friday so that isn 't rubbish we have the Yuma yep thank you very much CEO I appreciate the clarification you don 't wish to behave you can leave the chamber that is your first warning all right we have we have the matters before us I would then say any further questions yes council Walker more of a statements to thank the team for that did look at all these submissions about the buffers it was critical because I raised them some time ago in relation to the visibility from the highway if in the event this went through and the water quality monitoring in the groundwater and the overlay fermenting cemetery was critical in relation to the cultural excuse me cultural and heritage zone in that area because there were some locals that have very close ties to that cemetery I remember on ago I might just add matter made when the graves were moved for the second stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are my ancestors so I know how delicate it can be for those that are looking at those grave swatches two unnamed there that have to be protected as well and and I think just on that point there anything that is found during this process of a cultural significance that we create a register because we did that when we did the footpaths and the pipelines and anything of heritage rating that we did a register I think that 's critical as well but thank you all right being there 's no other discussions I 'll call for someone to move that we accept the recommendations of the staff do I have a mover Thank You councillor Ryder seconded councillor Maliki no and we 'll put it to a vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you councillors and thank you for the debate and I would like to thank the staff and the community for working together in trying to ensure that we can move with this process and minimize the impact I believe for the residents in the local area let me just for clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way to go yet the state is yet to approve what we 're suggesting as amendments correct thank you and that 's been made clearly a way to everyone in this process all right can we now ask councillors to move to the next agenda item which is item 8 it 's the minutes of the city image Advisory Committee those minutes have

Thank You counsel Martina are there any issues you wish to raise on that report thank you we will put that we have a mover and seconder we will put that item to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously I now like to move on to item 13 which is the grants on page one to four are there any issues around the grants any any questions for start I want to ensure that everyone I will declare an interest if I may I am patron vice patron the total and permanent disabled ex-service Association but just note that I am a patriot so just so we can be very clear it 's not the declaration of a personal interest it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillors aware that you are a patron of that organization under the act that being a patron of an organization is not a declare or personal thank you thank you all right can I have someone move that we that we approve this grant funding is outlined Thank You council greenies second a councillor a bond so the two projects here at the youth network outreach and the opie veteran bugle all right okay we 'll put that to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you we 'll move on to item 14 which is the grants and partnership report under 5,000 so alright there 's no relationship for any counselor on these matters can I have someone moved that we thank you cancel a door seconded councillor Walker being that there is no discussion we 'll put these up we 'll put this odd report to the vote that we note the granting of this funding all those in favor against carriage unanimously so that report is for noting now we 'll move on to community engagement cricket fencing the costs all right can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a seconder counselor who councilors mr. director do you wish to talk on this to advise what this is about through the chair it 's relating to the damage that was undertaken during the the monsoonal event that the the fencing was damaged if you may recall it coincided with groove in the MU as well and they needed to actually wreck the fencing to ensure the proposed the groovin the Moo event continued so that was undertaken they 've sought funding from other sources as a result of the the RFA funding and community grants funding their 25,000 short still and so the proposal is to provide the additional funds for the Cricket Club as a result of the costs incurred to erect the fencing can i I 'm just clarified for councillors this should could have been covered under cap defunding however due to the slowness of everything Council has had to come forward to pay these costs is that correct through the Chi matter media 's category sees basically more on sport and recreation time that has been slow being rolled out and Margaret might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take a few months before all the cat see and cat D projects are probably rolled out I 'm concerned that we will see more and more of these come through particularly around roads and things like this because the funding pool for these areas far is far as far outstripped by the applications that have been made excuse me madam mayor I would tend to agree with you given the slowness of their disaster funding the cricket season will be done and dusted before the funding becomes available yes wait a minute um it should be known as she 'll be noted as well hockey did very well from the state government after the the flood event out of that and and it 's a shame that we didn 't see that spread out further around that precinct and not just one club because there are other clubs that have had fence damage as well quite quite extensive fence damage which are funding themselves so you 're correct on there however this is excuse me madam mayor after we moved this particular item I 'm thinking all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you we will move this item let us move this and then you can seek an adjournment all right thank you all right counselors are there any comments on cricket rather than toilets all right we 'll put this to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you now cancel Jacob are you seeking in a German I am seeking an adjournment if we have counselors if we adjourn the meeting for ten minutes to allow councilors to have a slight break and then we 'll be back in this room at 45 all right can I move that a German no yes I 'm just on the adjust for noting I have to leave for a dentist appointments all will not be coming back to the chamber all right so that emergency dental work to be done I 'm sorry that 's her cancel like these things happen or up it will move the adjournment I have a move up councillor Jacob second the councillor Rabine all those in favor carried meeting adjourned till 45 I think in the interest of alright counselors alright counselors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin well the next one is the the future cities towns full of ents strategy could I ask brick broken who 's here to speak on that please yes thank you venture the strategy in front of cancer today is proposed to create a creative response for attracting acquiring hosting and doing building events in our city we already have a really strong history and attracting events here but the reality is is that we live in a national and global environment right now we have to get better every year to keep attracting the best in the world to come here she started time to be in events with our new three animal indoor stadium opening in three and a half weeks time and growing with our recent successes which has been NASA halo the attractions world model festival and other local events that we do very very well in short tons event strategies based on five key objectives branding ourselves as a city does great events building a better governance structure creating a central point of contact of all entities town of Townsville wanting to do advanced activations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structured framework for securing and assessing event opportunities maybe to be better able to understand and market our natural built and built assets to promote the best of all to come here Australia 's up for your consideration today thank you you all have had the report and obviously the background document that provides information around the report are there any questions so councillors we went to the election in 2016 branding Townsville as the events capital for North Queensland I think this strategy deals with the key objectives of creating or branding the city it creates an event governance structure that clearly outlines the various roles of count that of council and other key stakeholders it creates a professional central point of managing and coordinating all events initiatives through one office which we know has been part of the issue we 've had in terms of developing and getting events to the city it provides a framework for assessing events opportunities cancel a rider you go from tier 1 to tier 4 events so it doesn 't necessarily preclude the smaller events the city run and the strategy talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify and better market our event assets whether they 'd be natural or built and I think that 's very important when we look at this and I want to thank the staff for putting the the strategy together I note that you 've spoken to Sunshine Coast Coffs Harbour Christchurch who are very proactive in terms of bringing events to their precinct and their stadium to tourism and events Queensland James Cook University and many of our event promoters including Live Nation Ticketmaster PBR and Townsville tri fest so it 's an extensive group you 've consulted with they are all very minima I don 't have any questions but if I could just comment I think this is fantastic and a port Brett and his team for initiating so thank you it 's been very good thank you or I called you a comment please may I see my kids just like to actually congratulate the counselors around the room the CEO and the mare for actually taking the initiative to make this happen because this actually landed on the table three and a half years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very happy and thank the CEO for stewardship because I know there 's a lot of an adult past CEO so I think there 's a long-term thing that 's come to here and I 'm very proud to say that we can actually deliver that we all of us not just one word to turn there 's a lot of heads around the room and so congratulations to everyone yes thank you so if I move at council a rider will use second yes excellent so this is for adoption counselors we have a mover and seconder all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you we 'll move on to finance and business services so I might seek to move item 17 and 18 together counselor COO you okay I 'll move it second it are there any questions on either of these items they are one month behind we actually dealt with the mid-year financial review earlier if not if there are no questions or queries that will put those two items to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously item 19 is an EO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not director the GM of future cities do we have anyone who wishes to speak on this because again it 's one of the initiatives we initially discussed at Council so you can so could I have someone who wishes to speak on this matter merits of such importance that we have a number of speakers about these so perhaps we 'll start with stairs and matinee l can jump in as required all right Denis if you 'd like to come forward and because this is a important an important ioi that we are putting out through the chair Thank You counselors as we discussed in the Coffee cabinet the other week 10 gig was is based on some work that at Lake City have done and it 's really a piece furthering some things are running work it enables the precincts that we 've talked about it leverages the work was already done with that North Queensland regional data center and it really brings that digital infrastructure to towns will provide us not only a place make a loop ability but also competitive to businesses what gets me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those tertiary service providers technology type companies we alluded to we 've had a company that as a world-class product safety culture that started in Townsville but unfortunately they 've moved to Sydney because they just don 't have the infrastructure and the staff that they need to maintain here by going out to the EOI the purposes to test the market to see if they were a provider or providers that will come in and partners with us to provide this it 's targeted at precincts across the city and the purpose is to provide not only high speed internet but really to provide those business-to-business communications that allow these tertiary type organizations that come because when they come they also bring their service organizations and it 's all those use cases so that 's it in a nutshell happy to answer any questions thank you I know councillor you won 't have the presentation so through the chair or I may have a conflict of interest in this so I better because my son 's in the IT industry here in Townsville is he likely to tender for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a different form of IT but it 's dealing with a lot of companies I believe you know this 10 gig you know type setup I believe yeah counselor we don 't know who 's actually going to tender until putting an expression of the interest it could be local I guess if now our could be you know probably more the larger telecoms but it 's I can tell no that 's fine does that clarify it does clarify yes alright cuz I note that you weren 't at the presentation last week you were on the invitation list and I believe you were sent a copy of the presentation excellent all right counselors I think this is an exciting process as we for again it 's about upskilling Townsville infrastructure isn 't just about roads and rubbish and sewer pipes this is the new infrastructure for a community council kun thank you madam mayor and this super exciting for Townsville one of my personal mantras is that we actually should be growing retaining and attracting smart people to the city and this is one of the cornerstones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kinds of businesses and the kinds of employees that we need for our future in the city and it 's super exciting thank the staff for getting us to this point can 't wait to see well I won 't be seeing the eeo eyes but good luck to the council moving it forward thank you or I can I have someone move that we move the recommendation Thank You councillor saw seconded councillor qu we 've any further questions for staff or any comments wanting to be made by councillor sores or council kou if not we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously will now move on to item 20 which is the procurement for the solar shade project so this is a protest of result we 're resolving for it to a request for tender to provide solar shade in accordance with the local government so we 're seeking requests from suitable businesses to provide shade over Central Park pathway and also the car park at the back of the chamber all right so solar shade yes if the clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it isn 't a request for tender okay so the purpose of this is to change the way particularly our pedestrian environment works and it 's a let 's just see what is out there for the for us as a council all right it 's again it 's part of that mantra around sustainability for the for us as a community and as a city are there any questions for this price before I seek a mover can I have a mover please Thank You councillor maliki no ii it council array by are there any questions alright so I 'll ask that we put this to the vote all those in favor can I check again please all those in favor against carried unanimously the next one Thank You counselors is the procurement of parking meters again this one is so this is that we approve an expression of interest for the supply of paid parking meter options including payment platforms for the processing of card transactions and options for capital outlay for initial installation is there any comments from staff on this especially in fact that results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot to do that just to clarify matter man the first of interest to actually run a free trial would we 've received interest from a couple of supplies mom so it 's proposed to run a free trial for two three month period and we can determine the what 's the most suitable parking meter for for council moving forward yes to the director in relation to going out for an expression of interest as in the previous report it before we can go out for an expression of interest we need to establish that council acknowledges that it is in the public interest to do so so can I ask that to rectify that matter we identify that particular section in the previous document and included in this document yes so you seek to amend the document accordingly so perhaps I could have Tony provides us with these don 't you please thank you if you go back to the recommendation in the previous item which I 'm sorry the one before that that dealt with an expression of interest for future cities yep so it 's notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there Kenya stop there if you just copy from if you just copy that whole recommendation down and make that recommendation one sorry in the wrong before where I want it copied as into the new item not there yeah you 've copied it into that encase it in the foot into document it 's in 221 1010 that 's fine I just worry counselor kook you expressed you sure so if you if you copy that as a new item new recommendation one yes it 's fine and then the officers recommendation will become recommend recommendation yep that 'll mean yes so this is obviously about looking for new technologies in in meters where people can pay off their phones it may make life a lot simpler for everybody for the paid parking sort of areas and we should also flow on to helping our staff training our staff to do their job a lot better and stuff like that as well later on so I think it 's a good outcome for everyone that we start investigating this stuff and moving with the times correct counselor um in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use different ways to pay and currently our meters aren 't equipped to do that that American operator Madame air if I may now the recommendations read one count pursuant to section 2 to 8 subsection 3 a of local government regulation 2012 council decides by resolution that it would be in the public interest to invite expressions of interest before invite that 's what they 've written tenders to determine market interest and to put the officers recommendations be adopted all right thank you can I have someone move that we Thank You councillor Kim do I have a seconder councillor greeny is there any discussion on the procurement of parking meters none you 'll never win this argument we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you we 'll now move on to item 22 which is the lease of the blue water Community Association this is to resolve that we make an exception under the local government regulation in relation to this lease that there is only one Operator the blue water Community Association all right so do I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconder councillor Jacob is there any discussion on this all rights fairly straightforward if not we 'll put this to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously the next is the lease renewal for the trip or now again we 're resolving an exception here that applies to the lease negotiation allowing council staff to deal with the existing tenant the report is clear around this and the reasons for it could I have someone move Thank You council greenies second to cancel Martina are there any questions on this or comment I 've just got a comment madam mayor and I even at the moment given that Drupal has is closed and Luke senators continued to carry on the Swimming Club at the Townsville Grammar School just shows the following that he has and I believe very worthwhile and an great landlord and have a tribal pool thank you thank you any other comments on this item if not we will then put this to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously now item 24 councillor doll is leaving the room she has a MP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is for council to resolve that staff will negotiate a lease purely with the existing tenant now many of you remember that Danny if you want to give some background on this ya thinks mad at me and through the G we used to have Milly J 's when we redeveloped the mall they 've struggled over the past few years so Coffee Dominion or dominion coffee have taken over the existing lease they 've approached us and because they 've been a successful business for the past 20 years they 've approached us to spend some significant money in that facility but because the lease runs out next year after 12 months the amount of money that they 're gonna spend on that building building wouldn 't justify over 12 months so it 's a long-term commitment that they 're making and it is a substantial amount of money and we see it as a win-win tip for keeping you know that 's what activity in the CBD is well thank you are there any questions of the of the staff on this so they 're seeking an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenant all right can have someone move Thank You council greenies second it councillor rider if there are no questions or comments put that report for adoption or in favor against carried unanimously could I ask if someone could ask cancel the door please come back into the room Thank You counselor Jakob is counselor soars through the chair I 've already submitted a perceived conflict of interest on line item 25 I wish to advise which I 'd like to lead the childish discussion because of my connections with the sport that uses this facility all right Thank You counselor all right counselors this is around the it 's a report concerning the upgrading of the lights that Riverways stadium do we have fun Danny do wish to speak on this may the male pass on to my colleague sitting beside me inter-cities yes so working with snowman engineering group we 've done a engineering cost estimation study to look at the full cost of lighting moveaway stadium to support international cricket and obviously Australian Rules Football League games in Townsville the fear come out as expected about 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contingency of 19% in some big assumptions about our switch rooms in the aircon cost that would be evolved while be absolutely brilliant to have our stadium lit up that way and provide a chanela blocks the national broadcaster need to make the event successful it 's all data broadcasting rights these days and council doesn 't currently have differential ability to fund the lights for 16 years for cancellation for us to continue to develop the board the business case worker to craig australia AFL and other entities to see if we could attract some external funding to support the future implementation of the lights thank you this report from smek will be made public after this meeting I think it 's important because the community spending 10.1 million dollars on lighting out of our budget is a significant cost and you 'd have to argue would it be better spent in developing junior sporting fields and doing other things because at this point in time I don 't believe there was a suitable business case we don 't have the games proposed that correct that 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia but at this point in time the number of events and the visitation I 'll drive cannot justify a 10.1 million dollar investment when we a lot of local spoilers we just had a couple of agenda items about cricket and hockey Dez went through much law investments that need to be repaired after the floods we don 't currently have the money available counselors there are people out there who may be willing to spend this community 's money at the drop of a vote it does yes in where does all gear sico this is why AFL in cricket so where does a felt Queensland and cricket Queensland or quick in Australia and AFL ups raelia feet within this funding arrangement if this was seen as their the beneficiaries of this overall would it be expected that they would cough up some of the cost of these lines council I did have some preliminary discussions so the upgrade of the Allan board of field in Brisbane Brisbane City Council only needed to set aside 1 million dollars for that so the it was picked up by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bulk of this I know so they expect the ratepayers of Townsville to pay but no one seems to expect the ratepayers of Brisbane to pay so it 's a problem all we can do councillors is the recommendation is to seek full external funding for these sort of upgrades I 'm still to be convinced I think we need a full business case to assert what sort of games how many games and how and how the break up of revenue because apart from just the 10 million dollars in cost there are the operating costs and the cost to council in terms of any maintenance as well and depreciation so that all needs to be factored in okay counselors are you happy with the report all right can I have someone move that we adopt the officers recommendation Thank You counselor greenie second it counselor Maliki No are there any further questions on this matter or comments if not we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you announcer Oh Jacob we 'll now move to item 26 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read out to councillors if I can I 've sought advice from our legal staff too for me to be able to sit in on these deliberations as as a councillor I do have ownership of an investment property in Parma street that is on my pecuniary interests this item that has come to council this report has been deemed an ordinary business matter and as such there is no strict legal requirement for me to disclose any personal interest in any personal interest in relation to even voting on this matter an ordinary business matter of council includes voting on a resolution in relation to the terms on which goods services or facilities are to be offered by local government for use or enjoyment of the public in the local government area so I 'm not deemed as having a personal interest and I 'm checking correct the Local Government Act provides that councillors are able to participate in a meeting and vote notwithstanding personal interests in respect of ordinary sorry if I 'd respective ordinary business matters enables you to make a the to make the budget each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case if you think about the number of people who are likely to be a new who are in the what 's going to be the stadium event parking area it is almost inevitable that all of you will know people in that area the this is an Audrey business matter because it doesn 't pay for them it doesn 't mean it 's it 's not a matter in which the decisions can be motivated by their interest over over the any interest thank you now this matter is to consider the making of an interim local law over parking in and around the stadium 's precinct so I 'll ask our acting chief legal officer police to come forward and provide some background information thanks Pete at me the legal services was asked to assist with a regulation process to manage some of the impacts of the North Queens oh sorry the Queen 's in country Bank Stadium upon residents in adjacent areas your councils will be aware that out of the 300 small stadium the residential areas around there were almost to any zones no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a feasible response for the area close to Queens and Country Bank Stadium because there 's a high level of older properties or properties units all of which use on street parking it 's important to make it clear councils and residents that the proposals to introduce an interim local law and in then ultimately a local ward are designed to assist those residents yes it will put them to a little bit of inconvenience in obtaining a permit the permits will be free at an initial stage there are limitations on the number of permits that will be issued because we need to gauge how that would work once the stadium comes online and we will certainly be using a number of early events to refine and shape our responses what 's proposed is that there would be an interim like the war and I do have a slight change to the wording of that local law which we may as well get out of the way now if you go to page 5 which deals with conditions for the issue of residential parking permits and with light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find references to superiors of six months that 's to be changed at one month that was an earlier iteration and so what it was down to is to qualify for resident permit person needs to establish that they 're a full-time resident the proposed state event parking area and tenants will qualify if they 've got a residency or so what 's proposes that there be permits obtained that will authorize people to park a vehicle on street denominated vehicle on street without being fined during the period commencing one hour before an event to one and running through the event until one hour after again the objectives are and that 's for residents there will be authorized parking permits for businesses that 's there 's negotiations ongoing with businesses about how we can best roll that out to ensure that we met the objectives of assisting them throughout the the conduct of again we done whilst we want the stadium to work what people from whatever council to come to it we don 't want the consequence of that to be that the existing business isn 't palmistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within Kiwi is occupied by people all of them sitting across what hopefully watching the Cowboys win so business permits will be issued there will be ongoing consultation with businesses both immediately after the Elton John concert again after the first covered Cowboys Broncos game and Council will exercise quite a benevolent approach in relation to the treatment of any fines that are received by people who would have element would have been eligible for a permit but haven 't obtained them so people who are bona fide our residents we encourage them to go out and make an application get a permit avoid the in for the inconvenience but in the event that they go through the opportunity on cert and it 's found that they haven 't obtained a permit they receive it and notice from us that says they 're in breach the parking laws then it 's almost certain that they make application to the station those fines will be waged to stages an interim local law which has been developed after significant consultation internally and with stadiums Queensland involving how it works in other areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's in place v8 supercars so it 's been well tested over eleven years there 's a different area and that 's important to realise and it does have different impacts because of the different natures of the v8 supercar went to the stadium event but two stages one is neutral local law and draft with consultation bodies of name but not a lot of consultation with residents because it 's just not possible the consultants we don 't know the impacts everybody 's going to the imagining so that stage one gives us an ability to regulate over the next six months in that time this is stage two council will proceed to make its a second recommendation a permanent local law that local law we extensively shaped by consultation with residents and businesses and that consultation is likely to commence after after the Cowboys broadcast game at least so that people have experience at university or they 're feeding back to us there 'll be an extended consultation period to ensure that we 've got as much input from the public as we can and again just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area not to penalize them happy to take questions thank you are there any questions for me um just to confirm if I had a you know if you 've got a family even there with mom and dad 's got a car and son and daughter 's got a car they 're eligible for for permits no that 's the challenge there are I 'm still trying to get the exact number somebody else 's Valley week but there are multiples of residents than there are on street car parks in that area if we when if we launch this process with a every resident who applies as eligible preferment no one will get a part and there 'll be there 'll be resonance across units and everywhere else and you know we also have the difficulty is there 's a number of difficulties in policing because what of course we wish to ensure miss plaintiff on our residents can park the cars on the street but it 's not hard to work out because these are going to be the most attractive car parks and towns along game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on a needs basis so like if they 've got parking on on their residence is there a reason why they need to have a permit so they need to prove was a short answer or everybody the way we 've dealt with it is in this initial phase in the interim local law is every property unit residential property every unit every house will be entitled to one permit without proving need there will be provision for special permits in relation to carry food each evening all of those issues we take into consideration but wait special permits but in this initial phase every residential property will qualify for one permit if there 's a demonstrated need which is just not like I don 't have space but I have a demonstrated need over and above blame my life is lived then they would be able to obtain permits it 's unfortunate that in this initial phase if you 've got four cars parked on the street you can 't fit three of them within your property it is unavoidably an impact that those cars will need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention it may not last long term it 's certainly going to be the case for the first couple of events that we till we gain some experience about what happens excuse me men mate you can 't turn anything cancel just you said the interim rule will be over six month period looking at the cowboys joy their last home game is Saturday the 29th of October was council planning to implement it over the Cowboys games that home game season the interim local laws under under the local governor interim life awards can only be enforced for six months okay maximum six months what 's proposed is this the interim local law will commence on the 7th of February just gives us leave go things and rule and it stated in the local law in the 6th of August I can 't post a ping on the 6th of August in that six month period we will develop the permanent okay and we will have it in in effect prior to the interim April or inspiring the date of expiry anything and you the full time local law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law will be repealed at the same time okay Thank You Chancellor cook just a couple of questions um one the the permits are they going to be need to be fixed to a windscreen or they just ones that we put on the dash of a car cancels rolling in and recognition technology that 's my next question Billy James will engage that 's the end of July without being at the permit application today and the residents with a permit will simply go into an electronic database Council will then drive through the area during the control period during the regular period if the council vehicles will register what number plates are packed in those with we automatically noted not a problem all good beautiful those without a permit and and that 's a good segue to my next question is now our regular officers will be I understand will be out on the nights of major events starting with Elton John and you 've stated there 'll be a degree of leniency because they those registry office would be simply going out they weren 't necessary republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever to vehicles at the time they don 't have to do that we could probably longer-term we will send them out after the event but on the first certain for the first few events will have reach of people on the ground they will be stopping in to the extent that 's possible depends on the number of infringing vehicles but they 'll be placing notices on the infringing vehicles there and then the discretion will not be exercised by the those officers they 'll have no choice it 'll be recorded on the machine this vehicle is to have it have a notice issued to it the discretion will be exercised at the office by an administrative person and that will be dealt with later now the discretion the whole exercise of discretionary largely avoided for residents if they apply for permits during the application period and they obtain the thing yep and that there 'll be multiple ways of applying prime online is the primary one but we will have facilities available libraries will have a series about customer service college places will QPS be doing similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh one four hundred smiles yes won 't enforcing this local law keep us can be expected to be doing enforcement of a whole range of issues that night I 'm certain you 're not gonna pursue men upon what they 'll be doing that other than they won 't be enforcing this local water so I know what counselor coops going so currently the stadium precinct no one is allowed to park around there if you 're if you 're caught infringe and infringement notice is issued by the QPS I think I understand where you 're going Council of Cook the core simple question is why are council staff enforcing this locally why won 't the QPS doing it at a later date once it 's settled I can 't speak to that it 's been this has been presented to legal services on the basis that we need to facilitate this and because obviously counsel had to facilitate the local law around one three hundred smiles can I ask how was the local lord then it 's done around the stadium precinct two quite separate situations the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect it was made by the stadium 's queens in the state government in consultation state of Queensland and the residents that they declared as the state can do all the streets in that area because the state ultimately owns the streets all the streets in that area has no stiffening zones and they did that here the impact of that would be onerous and unacceptable on residents mm-hmm the state don 't have a capacity to introduce the nuance local law or nuance laws such as we 're proposing once they had the legal ability to do so I 've never seen them sort of descended to this level of refinement in seeking to manage the impacts on residents and legitimate businesses in the area you know in a very very close whilst still achieving the objective of regulating the stadium fact can I check with you to the director of infrastructure the discussions with stadiums Queensland around Brisbane they they do have a knee permit system switcher the same company does Suncorp it also does all the football stadiums in Melbourne and Sydney so we 've relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one of the things is the regulated parking gives us the opportunity to people to park there no standing is no parking at all at a dairy farmers at the moment the no standing and he goes back you know not very far into the streets at all crow flies so again as Tony said it 's about trying to protect the residents in this area by putting a system in if we put no standing at all no one can park there so again we 've tried to you know work with this DCA from Suncorp Stadium and understand the distance how far we should go again will we get it right the first time not sure that 's another opportunity for us to judge and work on it as one yep see oh do you have a comment I do madam mate can I bring us back to the original point of this discussion the transport management plan I keep seeing it being referred to as Townsville City Council 's transport management plan for the stadium is not council City Council 's transport management plan it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's a really important point to make we have had input as you would expect us to have input because we have the local knowledge we have an input for example in making Reed Park available specifically for parking during events and we have facilitated stadiums Queensland and the state in discussions with other bobby 's in relation to their parking in relation to these specific sites that red zones or restricted signs it was specifically our request to protect businesses and residents because otherwise under the TMP they would simply become no standing areas very different in Townsville than their knees at Suncorp Stadium or the mcj or any of a number of those so the process that we have developed what is to ensure that residents don 't lose completely their on street parking during that period of time which was exactly the case of one 300 smile the same in relation to the businesses in palmistry and in that vicinity to again protect their interests because the stadium is a wonderful thing for the future of Townsville and this city was really strong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to ensure that it happens so it 's really a clarification the TMP the transport management plan overarching is a state developed plan with input by Council we have specifically identified these restricted zones to protect our people in relation to QPS to PS and under their act can always issue pinc or parking infringement notices based on the signage that 's in situ no matter what the code local boy is however Tony is accurate and in in this legal opinion they will have a lot on their plate during that period of time our our regulatory officers and I can tell you clearly that we have spoken to our regulatory officers they will take a position of leniency it is our intent clearly through the introduction of this interim policy to use the first three or four events to set the platform so that everybody can develop an understanding on how it 's working and that 's when we 'll be going bat consistently and discussing it with businesses and with residents to get a better idea of how it works the documentation that is being sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be one parking permit but special circumstances we don 't say all of the special circumstances in the letter we do mention carers and we do mention health issues or special circumstances we as an organization will make the decision in conjunction with the residents in relation to the validity of those circumstances but I can guarantee you that leniency is a discussion that we have had with our parking officers they have an obligation under the Act to abide by the siamese that 's in situ but the decision final decision in relation to those will be made here in an administrative sense it is a exercise of understanding what the overarching impact will be thank you all right thank you for that statement see you are there any other questions remember this is an interim it 's about trying to get it right for the community to find the balance rather than not having any ability at all thank you thank you for that all right can I have we have version control of the interim attachment so can I be could you please yeah yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our documents that will change all right councillors can I have someone move this report Thank You councillor saws do I have a seconder councillor Doyle are there any comments all right we will put it to the vote all those

change is alive and introduce obligations for councillors regarding the way that council has managed personal interests in any council matters including matters that arise prior to a council meeting councils must consider if they have a personal interest that is a material personal interest a real conflict of interest or a perceived conflict of interest and any item being considered at today 's meeting if a council has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in our matters today it should be declared as required under the Local Government Act if a council meeting reasonably believes or reasonably suspects that another counselor has a material personal interest or real or perceived conflict of interest in a matter to be discussed at the meeting today and that counselor has not informed the meeting about the interest the counselor must advise the chairperson the meeting as soon as practicable about their belief or suspicion and the facts of circumstances that form the basis of that belief or suspicion thank you thank you now councillors you 've had the statement read out there is a conflict of interest but it relates to a closed item and I just wish to seek clarification through the chief legal officer did we declare that now or at the time of the code then the item comes to the council I 'd like to declare it after if I may because we will be in breach I believe of confidentiality until the matter is tabled so thank you Tanya if you will I 've emailed you that that matter we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just just to be clear madam it would need to be declared after the meeting moves into closed session any other council I have a conflict of interest Thank You counselor door will be a council meeting with that one I declare that I have a material personal interest relating to confidential item number 22 future city 's report I declare a material personal interest my husband and I have a commercial property and business within Flinders Street East

petitions none there are no deputations no notice of motion I might ask if the federal member do you need to leave urgently we can easily have you out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the update from Martin Locke if I may sorry Martin I did not acknowledge you previously but if you 'd like to step up here now that we 're live I should advise all people who are part of counsel process that this is streamed live through our YouTube channel I don 't think it 's breaking viewer audience recognition however it 's been part of the openness and transparency of counsel so if I can Thank You Martin thanks very first time called you made me appreciate that I should be embarrassed my first time in council here but thanks for the invite a shinto to come along and and talk about something that we 're doing together in the community so what probably just like the two things this short time I 've had given here to quickly go through some pretty and talk about where fun is lines at and then I think it appropriate in the setting here to talk about why what made me want to do this and hopefully on a bigger picture it 's gonna benefit all of us so finish line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job together with council where a council property I had a property next door and can support their property to get a lane way through and an opportunity over several months to talk to doing something positive together for the city where I think from any angle where everyone sitting it 's gonna be all around benefit for everyone so fun design we all know about where it is just some pretty pictures here where it 's at we are at the stage where this is from Flinders Street and looking down the lane way that I guess the lane way which is actually a drop from Flinders Street down to open Street of approximately 2.8 meters so it lends itself to two levels of shop fronts opening out into an interactive Lane way which council own and we 're working together there so that 's a view from Flinders Street this is the first level from Flinders Street my building is the tendencies across the top there you 'll see there 's a we 'll be constructing a balcony which steps in and out around coming off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times I spent more time working this in the in the lion way to try and make sure the the public all of our rate dollars have gone to towards something is going to be very significant for everyone so the balconies yep we 'll be looking down into a centre it 's a bit hard to see what will be there it 's a vampy theatre has a main feature in the center of the the laneway there 'll be seating that you see stepped around the outside which you might go to this view here this view is from if I go back if you see on the left hand side sorry left and right on the organ street there 's a about me wraps around and there 's a CT looking back into the Lyme way we 're sitting on that balcony looking back down at the amphitheater stage there looking back towards Flinders Street so I guess we 're an opportunity for an intimate public space to create some people can perform sing dance and we 'll work together hopefully get something good I guess a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it to look like a laneway so obviously with open Street behind here and going through so I am visit just being a place not where people work in the city want to come and visit the city they could bring their own lunch sit in this public space the next day they might buy something off me be nice but it 's certainly a place it 's not just for me I 'm putting our it is some fortunate that is a backyard that we can work together with but it is a public space and we 've put a lot of work to make sure that everyone gets I believe great value out of this and it 's a place of pride a place where we will take people in a as I 've said before it 's not a large development but it 's a very significant one leaking it through the city line this is down at the Ogden street level so got some public amenities in the back of my building which will be used for anyone using the laneway and the seating will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some synthetic turf and trying to give it the feel of a public park land so the bill uses and vertical gardens we play with that a fair bit on what mature trees or whatever could go in there but some nice greenery so with the stage we 've got all the holes knocked out of the walls on mine top and bottom we 're working as fast as we can to try and get it finished and fortunately won 't be done before the stadium opens but that 's ok it 's a long-term project and I probably just want to what made me so inspired to do this I guess was so I bought the building for was a long-term hold at the time and you would have something that drives you 're more than a financial gain I do and when the discussions started I saw this as something sure that down on I believed in I believe the city is a great place to sue it 's going to grow you wouldn 't be here otherwise I believe and wouldn 't be doing your doing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to two years almost coming up to working with different people a council and look it was challenging early on and you know I hear stories of how tough it can be working with council we had a few of those not going to deny it but I 've I 've always thought there 's a bigger picture here we 've all got to be above it and that 's probably been a bigger reward that I 'm looking forward to developing further as what we 've walked through together and the private sector I 'm not a big time developer but I 'm putting a stake in the ground here and I want to be part of this city and private sector and government especially your local government I 'm mobile everyone will look at this as a great outcome and a showpiece of hell Council and private sector can and should work together and whether there 's more in the future don 't know yet but I want this to be a place where everyone that 's paid their tax dollar and can come and visit can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that we 've done together so that story will be told be on the truck and appreciate the opportunity there 's been a I guess with everything going on at the time with Alcoa enquirer being mentioned before him and um it took a bit of guts for council to to work with me which I couldn 't see that 's on I couldn 't wrap my head around it I will admit because on my reputation I don 't want tarnished either and and but I 'm glad we did stick it out and get to the point where we are and I can 't wait to deliver this and I 've only just got the information memorandum and starting to hopefully get some tenants in there soon but the discussions I 've had is going to take this to the next level if the people that I 'm speaking to who want to be involved in here is going to be fantastic so again thanks opportunity to update you here today thanks your support to get to this stage appreciate and understand your role I hope we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can work together more in the future so thanks very much Thank You Martin and many of us have seen your great community work particularly in developing silver level homes for people in our community it 's I 'm pleased that council has been able to work with you constructively on this project and I think bit by bit we 'll start to see development more development in and around the city I 'm very hopeful of further announcements in the new year but good luck with the project and I 'm sure you 'll continue to get a bit of a hard time from some of our staff and I 'm sure you 'll be able to give it back to them too well done thank you I 'd now like to call on I think Inga is doing the presentation on where we 're at with the three-part waters no Scotty Scotty thank you Scott so this is an update on where we 're at with the funding arrangements we have with the state government the 225 million on the three three point order security solution thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh update of how we 're going with this the 3.1 security update so the like to say is the Horten pipeline is racing to completion of pipe working structures by January 2020 one of the first contractors has put it the final pipe in the ground of less weight last week and they 're starting to fill that pipeline to start to test and commission that over the next month or so so just a list off of all the contracts have gone through so we 've had two construction contracts one with Mindy and the gdj McCormick have achieved their practical completion we 've had all the GRP pipes have been fittings and fittings completed and delivered to site so DJ McCormick were completing them the Bank Road tunneling and pipe jacking under the Flinders Highway and man eye and the railway and Mindy constructions did the ground preparation and the clearing what was called labeled as clearing and grop we 've also so at the moment twenty eight point three kilometers apart on have been installed two eighty five percent and fifty concrete structures of sixty-five percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had a few weeks from there and as because all contractors are on site the production has ramped up and we still are trying to get everything in the ground by Christmas and commissioned early next year so the biggest success so far on this project is breaking up those packages so local contractors have maximized the opportunities with local contractors and we 're estimating that it 's great local jobs and with over a thousand direct and indirect workers and more than 200 local businesses directly and indirectly engaged so on that side it has been a real success so so by Christmas we will aiming to have the pipes in the ground to the Horton River originally Stage one was to go to the Horton channel we are now going to the to prepare for Stage two is to get to the Horton River have a locked and completed by there and we 'll move into stage one point one which is where as you can be seen in this graph here where the original root is you can see in the top left whether it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was going to go over to the Horton channel over the right we 've now had to redirect that so that I can connect to the future stage to pipeline so next year what we 're doing for us what we put now pooling stage one point one we 've already gone to tender for the the Horton River Crossing we 've already gone through with our cultural heritage of management agreement and Weavin negotiated that the land tenure environmental approvals are being renegotiated we 've designed the realignment and we 'll start the construction of the River Crossing is planned for the second quarter probably March April just go for four months and by then we will have retentate for the two point six kilometers of pipeline and that will be underway in that same second quarter and one of the key objectives I should mention on that one is why and the benefit we have with stage one point one is will provide some continuation of employment and local businesses so the breaking up as we have for stage one for giving the maximize the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through next year while we 're doing some of the development stays for Stage two so that 's one of the key benefits we have of pushing the redirected section into next year so Horton pipe one the next steps the priority focuses on completing stage one that 's commissioned and ready to go by February and handover in March that is our key deadline and a commitment that we have the pipes will be in the ground but there 's a lot of commissioning and other work to be done over the wet season January February which but if the pipes on the ground then the wet season risk has been mitigated so we 'll complete tendering for stage 1.1 in construction contracts in the first half of 2020 will complete the Horton river crossing and realignment by November 2020 and complete stage one point one to suit the along the stage two of the hotend pipeline by the end of in the same timeframe than have been the next year so in negotiations are progressing with the federal and state government in relation to stage 2 project and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for stage 2 can commence in the first quarter of 2020 so the touch the photo here graphic chose the quantum of structures completed across the four pipeline installation package as of the 21st of November 2019 so you can see that mostly the I think it 's the areas in yellow what 's in the ground ready to go but there are some sections in the green and some of the structures that are still have been going the last couple weeks and will be done over the next month next of the three point water security plan is the recycled water the scheme will deliver high quality recycled water to a range of irrigation industrial customers by taking the treated influent from Cleveland Bay purification plant which is the green in the next to Cleveland Bay and passing through an advanced treatment process to treat achieve Class A plus standard which allows us to put on parks and gardens in schools and parts of open space so the scheme will produce 15 mega litres a day of recycled water with a majority of the pipe work to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuumber road or Abbott Street you can start to see the pipes being laid out and constructed the darker this diagram shows the 24 kilometres of pipe work that are in process of being laid to deliver the recycled water to our customers the different colors reflect the different packages of work that are to be delivered once again we sought to break down the work into packages that local firms have the capacity to deliver the progress to date so the first section was awarded to our OMS and they 've completed the pipe one through an Adele and was laid in conjunction with a sudden subversive rising main now that 's been complete and signed off there is another contract we 're awarded to Newlands and BMD to construct what we call the sp1 and s p2 which construe connects from that ennerdale section all the way to Cleveland Bay then again there 's a southern suburbs rising main and the recycle water main at the same time and the construction of the section of the recycle water main that will feed the new a new stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council staff and laying that section and that 's another three point six kilometers and that the main challenge and that one has got significant under boards across Queensland Rail assets or the Ross River and Main Roads assets as well we 've aqua flow have been engaged by council are now constructing the pipeline that council golf course will use to temporally irrigate the golf course from Athens where this section of work we will be connected to the recycled network and will use the bat feed through sheriff park and aplans where park areas as well so that 's that 's also underway we 're also finalizing the submission to Department environment and science to bury our discharge license from Cleveland Bay to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park the submission has relied on the input from Council Hunter h2o acorn as well as going ongoing dialogue with department environment science and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure we have me together all concerns and risks of what 's going to the environment and the and at the TW council water and waste personnel have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group to assist in separating the potable water systems in preparation for fields being connected to the recycled water network and I 'd like to say the part of the business case for this whole recycled water network was the security of our social infrastructure for potential droughts so this isn 't one of our biggest gains we have an implementing out the next steps in the recycled water project the industrial water pipe is currently being priced by companies so not just social infrastructure and public opens it 's also about supplying industry in the state development area namely some metals and others that may be the industrial water pipe is currently being priced by companies already engaged on the project as a variation we 'll be seeking council approval to award this once the pricing exercise is complete watering it to one of these companies will deliver savings in terms of mobilization to them already being on site and engaged in similar work we will be finalized the detail of the tanks required at to Cleveland Bay purification plant and Murray which is part of the staging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Works at those both sites will be underway shortly and we 'll prepare the tender package for the 2021 works which is this is what is going on in now for the to be delivered next year but the next stages in 2021 will be code to James Cook University the Townsville turf club in the album or those other areas that we also up plan for the greater scheme so at the moment we 're finalizing the technical specifications and negotiating the technical works around the treatment plant with clean tech and get final approval for the contract to enable construction in early 2020 before the close of the Christmas holidays we just need to put the finishing touches to our submission aspect to the part of environment that we 've been working them with and we 're just waiting to the final detail regarding the nutrient reduction system from clean tech to enable us to do this we 've been working closely with clean tech Gurgaon and I accom to establish the electrical requirements for the plant we 've now provided along with fine electrical loads so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what our high voltage and low voltage requirements are and so we can finalize electrical design on that area so this is I 'd like to just show this this is a preliminary overview of what our recycled water treatment plant will look like so this is going to be parked next to our Cleveland Bay purification plant and we 'll be able to process the water to that class a standard a plus standard over like so can I just ask you a quick question on that for the for the people here you may not know this isn 't a traditional arrow plant is it and consequently it uses a lot less power than a traditional arrow plant that is correct and the Cleveland Bay purification plant produces some high-quality effluent our only issue is some salt in the water and that means that we haven 't had to go to full treatment we have this intellectual property of that is not has enabled us to go to a different set of technology that reduces a lot less power and it 's a lot more affordable when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with this new technology I want to advise counselors and visitors this was Australian technology that initially no one in Australia wanted to use and it was being used in Japan so I think we 'd be the first place in Australia to use this technology on scalp in the utility sector in the urban environment some of the morning companies have been using this technology thank you so the next one and probably the most successful but this has been our other success story so normal how the community has embraced some of the impressive numbers are up on this slide so as you can see is twenty-two thousand households registered a hundred percent of the funding as it was allocated in 16 weeks and the website was viewed eight hundred and fifty thousand times so and also over one hundred and sixty four thousand products and services on water I 'll just go through our target was roughly twenty thousand so we 've exceeded that number and really we would have that 's and we 've been our squeeze that money as far as we can to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 percent of the program funds to go directly into rebirth baits and garden support practices this is more this means over eight million dollars is flowing into local businesses and those products are going to local houses as well so our website has been viewed more than eight hundred and sixty thousand times the website is the mechanism by which people can access the program but it also is an important education space for people to find out and information about the three point water security solution as a whole and importantly water saving tips so it 's a great to see getting lots of attention because this is not just about the water that smart packaging approach this is about engaging our community and helping them to find you see what water saving solutions are out there but they can adopt we thought a winner originally when it would take one year to expend the money so it 's finished in one third of the time and that we thought it would take so that 's to the towns of community taking up this opportunity so there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldn 't achieve this without ten local businesses we have partnered with it deliver the package I think it 's also important to outline that dozens of other businesses will be benefit by providing products and services to our suppliers we have estimated that the package has created 100 direct and indirect jobs of those households that have ordered twenty-eight percent of them are classes low socio-economic and we have exceeded our target number of take-up households in this category which i think is another point of celebration against any other utility in australia and some of the lessons learned is we are the ones that have been able to target and deliver successfully took both border community some of the council 's in this in drought in the south at the moment a try 71 percent of the orders place have been from the wider community with just shy 15,000 households in that category having ordered we originally aim for 200 body corporates to get involved but we didn 't hit our target with that only a hundred and eight have registered so it 's still pretty good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system while the package is closed people who have registered but not yet ordered have until 4th of february 2020 to do so we also remind people have orders the system to go and collect a good once the suppliers have contacted you to let you know they 're in so that 's where the system has allowed people to pull the order now they 're in it 's just a friendly reminder now it 's time to go and pick up and enjoy the new product so the garden Support Package results of this of their water smart package this is where we had it up for the automatic orders and the manual water ISM we had a couple of different support packages that helped them to improve their gardens the no cash outlay option of the garden support package has continued to be the most popular offering with over 91% of orders being placed for that so this was particularly liked by the law so it show economic peak of people in that category but there and but in general this is what most people liked off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is way to the manual waterers package with over 76% choosing that and only 23% of the customers choosing the automatic package as you can see under the automatic package the top 3 based on orders with a native plants we sold out of these in three weeks mulch livery with over nine 2 thousand households to receive about 28,000 cubic meters of mulch which is more than eleven Olympic sized swimming pools worth and the lawn care packages which contain a range of products to become water wise so that 's been a I 've seen a lot of pauses of mulch around the streets and there 's still a lot more to go over the next couple of months to be delivered the really interesting and unattended benefit here in terms of take-up was the interest in compost bins and worm farms with those combined from both the manual and automatic package it was one of the most popular ones we had over 9,000 100 compost forms ordered and just sort of three thousand worm farms but they may also have a positive impact on their green waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the manual side we have more than 16,000 700 tap timers also just over 20 1400 low-flow sprinklers so another popular part each person can order two to each of these and with the flow flow sprinklers we offered both large and small type sizes to account for people have different size areas that need watering so these low free sprinklers are know a lot of the council 's have seen them at some of the displays and more suitable for our soils and so we should have a reduced loss of water once again our native water wise plants where they could order up to 30 here sold in three weeks with seventy-two thousand eight hundred and seven of them ordered the lawn care packaged mulch and compost bins and were farms will also again a big hit we also provide a mob spread service for those were unable to physically spread it themselves and had about 330 households to take advantage of this offer water saving devices so the individual rebates in this area well less than nine percent of orders coming through still represent about 3800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchase for both within and outside their home so this is where in some of the areas we are a partial rebate so this is where they we 've had a high impact of taking up to 3,800 water saving devices of the high impact devices which were eligible for a rebate up to two hundred and fifty dollars the most popular were the smart irrigation controllers with almost 600 of those over 400 rebates for low water turf where we mainly saw zuzia and other couch varieties and pool covers also proved popular even though they were expensive as did the rain water tanks for the medium impact devices which were largely indoor focused on toilets and washing machines at 100 each we only had 267 of these across the low-impact devices eligible for up to 50 the most popular being the high hose in trig enosis or spray guns with over 900 of these just shy have 300 wells for starlet rated shower heads so this is more high-efficiency gel heads and 224 grain water diverter hoses with filters we also had a component where L lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a qualified installer to install any water saving devices in the home we had another 50 households that took up this offer as well it 's included as part of their overall rebate that that was on offer timers so for the body corporates which were eligible for up to 1,000 amount the products that appealed to them were the smart irrigation controllers and drip irrigation followed by low wall low water use or artificial turf steps for the water smart package so for the net as as we said as a lot of people put orders in but this is where we 'll continue the price process the rebates and invoices and in continued to encourage those who have registered but not ordered to get their orders in by February 2022 and this is where we start to deliver once we 've engaged the custom of the community and shown them what solutions are out there is deliver a six month community education awareness campaign around wise water use and assisting people with the knowledge they need to use their new water saving devices and appropriate watering behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of February 2020 to get their orders in they will then have until the 4th of May 20-22 get everything with us finalized before we achieve full financial flows of the program we have commenced the lessons loan process which will complete once financial Clause is achieved as part of this we 're already sharing as I 've discussed the sharing lessons with an Engel is working with the Brisbin on the program which is organized by Queensland Hope Council of social services with other water so the Queensland cancellous social service is actually our single a lot of water utilities and Department natural and process so to see what we could learn from that a new course able to share within our experiences and under the V will be complete all air requires for final reporting at the end of the financial year so we 've had some major existence here all and through the Inger and her team but it 's also it 's only just started now we 've engaged it to believe it 's now working with him over the next six months so that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awareness of how to use water wisely thank you very much Scott so you have a statement to make on this just a quick comment madam mayor thank you Scott I think there 's a couple of important points in this the queue cost factor was really based around the fact that the Queensland Council of Social Services recognized the ability of this program to reach the lower socio-economic strata within Townsville so they now intend to use our model as an exemplar model when they are looking at how they can influence that lower socioeconomic group I think it 's an important point because in fact that points to the overall success of it the other one is the recycled water the importance of the recycled water and it is a point that I wish to continue to drive home is in fact a reduction in the use of potable water so the importance of the free stage program obviously education and the giveaways have led to the ability to us for us to run the education program but we should not underestimate the importance of the recycled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipe and we thank all governments for having been involved in stage one and two in relation to the pie but I think it 's important to understand that the recycled water which will relieve our own parks and open spaces from using potable water but relieve industry from being an impost on potable water which again will reduce cost to the community and ratepayers across the board as we manage that process and replace potable water we recycle or thank you madam me Thank You C can I just comment we were we were funded to the tune of 225 million by the Queensland Government on this project now traditionally projects like this normally are given to a Tier one contractor we were able to convince the queensland government that we as a local council could manage this project manager deficiently use our local contractors and enable them to grow in capacity can I say that I think we 've been able to deliver for the Queensland Government very much the outcomes they were looking for a number of the local contractors involved in this project now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actors under the federal government to allow them to be able to now tender for the next phase but that accreditation also allows them to to tender for many other contracts that are coming up over the next few years particularly around defence and the Australian Singapore training initiative military initiative if it wasn 't for this project and us and the government having the faith that a little local council like ours could deliver it it would have been a lot harder for many of our local contractors to build capacity and capability so that they are able to move on to the next stage I know that a number of them will be working on some mining projects in the interim but they are very keen to move on to stage 2 and especially the ability to move into the next phase I am so pleased with the outcome I was on site today as we laid the last few pipes on the project I was very pleased to speak to many of the local workers on there and the fact that they had the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of term we said we would deliver water security and we have through the support of both the federal and state governments will be able to deliver a foot we are able to keep areas of our city green and as the CEO said we are able to provide affordable water for industry not potable water it will mean we will be able to hopefully put off any extensions to the douglas water treatment plant because we will have more than 10% of our daily water being normal use being used through the recycled system ladies and gentlemen it really is a win-win for this community it 's a great project Scott I continue to look forward to updates on the project and see if you could please thank the council team involved on all three projects I 'm sure that over the next few years the proof will be in the pudding so to speak in terms of our water and our water costs and Philip that 's the reason why I wanted you to go last I thought it was important that you saw that presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision for the city so I may ask if you could come up please and I thank you for your patience thank you I was told five minutes and I didn 't know you could have a PowerPoint look I 've been a little bit lazy huh sorry oh we actually asked your office if you wanted to give a PowerPoint of your headphones I feel like I 've let the audience down at home watching in life going he doesn 't have a PowerPoint he 's only gonna be for five minutes I 'd like to start by thanking you madam mayor for allowing me to come today and also acknowledge a CEO Mike if that amazing job ain 't for the hard-working councillors who will either by retiring or staying on in any capacity I think you 've worked very hard for your divisions and you 've served this community well I want to start a little bit different I believe that a part of my role is to put and I 'm sure I 'll be backed up by the council 's in the mayor is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number one thing we will have political jesting and disagreements but that 's okay that 's how healthy debate happens but as long as it doesn 't get in the way of the people of Townsville now that means regardless of the project if it creates jobs and is an economic driver you 'll have my support whether it comes from someone from the labour party the greens ' independent or wherever I 'll stand next to them and get in photos and beat the drum and back it in because people and the people of towns will have to come first I feel for a long time through different levels of government I believe that we have been neglected in towns I believe that we 've been playing politics for too long and sometimes I get a little bit excited and I want to you know get involved in the political jousting but it has to be people force and the bear and I have done Ilic Park recently we spoke about black spots we 've stood there together because he United all levels of government in Townsville is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the people or for self-interest and if we 're not doing that then we shouldn 't have this job so I just wanted today to come in and talk about some projects that we 've committed to that we 'll be delivering and that are in this budget so illage Park for example isn 't in this budget that was in a previous budget so there 'll be some things that will be left out that people may know of or I 've heard about but that 's because it 's not in this budget so 22 million dollars for the martyr Hospital in Townsend Hospital and Health Service nine point six million dollars for North Queensland water infrastructure authority 200 million dollars for stage two of the plaque one three hundred million dollars for Townsville inland to Roma and Tennant Creek Road upgrades 75 million dollars for the port widening channel project 144 million dollars for towns with Ring Road Stage five two million dollars for palm oil and water security twelve million dollars for driver 15 million dollars for the marine tourism precinct 1.96 million dollars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrade 94 million dollars for jcu innovation complex 15 million dollars for the cowboy Center of Excellence ten million dollars that will be spread out between yumbo Mehta Salvation Army sounds of turf club and forty nine point nine million dollars that will go into the fence now some of them are knife projects so knife is a loan a low-interest loan that businesses and companies have the opportunity to draw down on but all these projects here that I 've just talked about can 't just be delivered by the federal government no way it 's not how it works it is a through government all level of government projects so it 's it 's not about me running around trying to turn side every couple of minutes to and talk about how good the federal government is in the in projects that 's not what it 's designed to do it 's not what we 'll be doing I need to be working with the council the state government and obviously working with my counterparts in different departments in the federal government to ensure that politics left at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're doing everything that we can be we can to ensure that Townsel isn 't just back on the map it is the map breaking it down so the health of 22 million dollars it 's 13 million dollars for the towns of hospital so it 's a new 33 bed ward and 9 million dollars for the model hospital relocated in rebuilding their maternity and neonatal ward which is exciting for me because my wife 's pregnant so getting everything closed and gripped up together is really exciting for me so the two hundred million dollars is for the yeah pipeline defense so the forty nine point nine million dollars spent is on new facilities at the fifth Aviation Regiment to support the introduction and sustainment of three new ch-47 Foxtrot Chinook helicopters and associated integration systems tourism 1.5 million for the stage-two of the museum one water art and of course the castle hill activation plan and the Naif so the Cowboys training and high performance center the airport and the JC you are all nae Florence so they will loans get paid back of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's three different BBB RF or different funding grants and things like that because the federal government doesn 't normally grab money from bank accounts when they go through a grant system and then it 's drawn down as it as it goes ahead so this is over 1 billion dollars that 's going to be delivered in Townsend that 's more than nearly any other electric so it 's huge and it 's gonna do wonders for our city and I 'm happy to table that 's spend as well you know I you have an election coming up for the council 's and that 's great things don 't stop things keep moving I know you 're going to caretaker mode you know a part of our delivery for different projects we 're not going to press pause on anything but we 're going to keep it as non-political as one can during an election because it 's not up to me to decide anyone 's fate or be jumping up and down with anyone it 's a democratic process but projects do need to continue to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Met if anything you we need to be doing and delivering we 'll be doing together but your elections are for you yeah and for the people so I think it 's important that we change the narrative and definitely in towns all of political parties kicking each other every chance we can get you 're stuck with me for three years so regardless of who you vote for or you have voted for for three years I 'm your member for Herbert at the federal level so I need will be accessible to everyone and I think that 's putting the people first so that 's kind of it in a nutshell yeah the projects that we 'll be delivering you want to take whistles are there any questions from counselors all counselor yeah Thank You Phil for being here today and I really appreciate you spending some time with us the just some issue some I suppose more information with yourself in relation to the commitment on that on the stage I think we 're calling at one point 1 stage 2 stage film just reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delivery of the cash are locked the money so we get into that next phase yeah so the conversations that I 've had there 's a department that I think setting up a committee or setting up our project yep you know oh well I 'm glad you can by all feel that but I just thought doing whatever handle on it in relation to like the time frame because no no no no I 'm just that well you wanna I 'm just a system Christendom so I 'm just glad to see you I won 't say it but it 's just that the state gun was still a bit on the 225 million it 's exciting and people expect in the second stage and I just don 't want any hiccups as we go forward because the manufacturing of pipe pumps and fittings as we go forward to make sure that it 's a transitional phase of the stage traversal yep sure so the money 's there there 's milestones and things that whoever the proponent is needs to meet which includes I don 't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to jump in but the the money hasn 't disappeared being reallocated the money is ready to go and the process is that because funding can 't come directly to local government from the Commonwealth government and that 's based on the fact that local government isn 't recognized in the Constitution so in effect what happens is that the where we 're at is the Commonwealth Government is working with the Department of Natural Resources mining and energy in the preparation of a project agreement our officers are also involved in those discussions and they will be then a grant deed between the state government currently with the officers and we 're reading through that at this point there is no concern in relation to the funding and its availability I think you may think you see I just just on that point it says it 's gonna be a smooth transition so we go straight in the stage to you there 's no there 's no gap yeah thank you actually that 's good to know it 's it is very important because with progress I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's all apart slide so it 's pretty exciting to see that rolling through that 's good thank you thank you if there 's no other questions I want to thank the member for her bit but just before you go can I point out to you two things that are important to us this is the australian government 's plan as you know on population yeah a really important one and you may not have seen this yet but this is the Senate Select Committee for jobs in regional Australia I 've been through it we 've got a lot of projects here and there fundamentally there I call them sugar hit projects because they build and go we need support in actual long-term job creation where people can move and settle in the north because obviously for us as a council what we 're looking at is growing the rate base and if we can do that we can deliver better more affordable services to our community at least on some of these project has the government still looked towards ensuring local contractors you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms will still allow us to manage the project the way we have but some of these projects like the Ring Road for example stage 5 previous contractors moved people from down south we want to see that money continue to generate locally oh I understand agree with you and I think that it should any project should always go to local contractors and locals first it 's like I 'm seeing with the shown Singapore military initiative shale water the defense contractors didn 't tell that the tyonne 's or the the primes you must have 80 percent they asked them how much can you guarantee will go to local contractors and they said 80 percent so we 're talking about a t1 prime yeah then that 's that the flip on it if you 're talking about Stage five it should go to two locals it 's not it 's it doesn 't get mandated though by government to say everyone else is out you 'll Rin but it does go on like team so you get way way too similar to what we 've been running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you were in there that most of the tier ones are owned by foreign companies I 'd have to take I 'd advise you to have a look it 's one of the the little things I do because for us growing capabilities important honor would hope the government would look into the future and growing more local at least Australian growing capability so spotless is a prime are they hire locals so it 's not they 're not flying people from overseas to work with you but sorry they 're not but they management Bay 's close they management down in Townsville I believe and now everything 's managed from Sydney that 's the fit to me that 's the key we found with our spend really hammering it on being as local as possible has been a major bonus for the community it the spend the federal government has and it 's borne out in all these on all these reports can have a major impact in developing the north oh definitely but it 's so it 's like the the stadium the hundred million dollars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't put it in a bank account they gave it to the state government and to manage so it 's like with a lot of contracts it doesn 't go into a bank account it will run through normally the state government tree so there we don 't really regulate the state government on their procurement or their who they 're awarding contracts to thank you Phil thank you for that well done we 'll now move we finished the the presentations or up to Merril minutes and councilors I do have a mayoral minute based around the floods if I can today I rise to advise counsel and to inform the community of the continuing effects of the monsoonal event on our community infrastructure the two weeks of deluge that began on Australia Day 2009 tene seemed like a dream for some and a continuing nightmare for others in our city during this period about 39 local governments were declared disaster areas as flooding rains and torrents of water ripped through communities west to Cloncurry and north into the gulf and cape communities for towns will it meant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family on the front lawn during the event every person in a senior position within the federal and state governments came to the city telling us all they were here to help councillors it 's been more than 45 weeks since the monsoonal event began and I believe Council is working hard to deliver the recovery of community assets the assets that belong to the people of Townsville at the time council provided an indicative amount regarding damage to community and environmental infrastructure to the government agencies coordinate coordinating disaster funding recovery arrangements the cost was around 282 million the amount set aside as part of the disaster recovery funding arrangements for the 39 local governments is 242 million so competition for funding is tight Townsville parks and gardens are owed reserves our irrigation networks are all part of our community infrastructure these areas suffered incredible damage that is hard to quantify the value how do you quantify the value of plants and garden beds washed away there is more than 5 million dollars in damage to this alone along our river roads and beyond our irrigation network that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars to ratepayers and again extensive portions of this system were significantly damaged during this event all this is not an I repeat not covered by a disaster recovery funding around it 's areas such as clued in while guru Dahlia hermit Park Ross Lee manding burrow railway estate all suffered immense damage to our public infrastructure and council cannot seek funding support under the disaster recovery funding arrangements as these assets are not considered essential public assets and while council has received some funding for work needing to be done done along our Scout riverbanks there is more than 20 million identified in environmental damage alone Council has lodged business cases for funding in these areas but as I said earlier there is a lot of competition from those 39 councils affected by the floods the state of our city is not pristine it is it is as I would say as it is in pristine but council is determined and I want to acknowledge that because I believe it is important that we acknowledge to our community that we understand some of their frustrations but we are determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory as soon as possible we are all frustrated by delays however I want to acknowledge the hard work of our staff in their part of our community recovery ladies and gentlemen we are we are asking our staff our council officers to identify opportunities to action this restoration within councils existing operations budget we could have done this sooner if we had money we could have doubled our staff for a period of time and ensured that these areas were restored as quickly as possible however the council is committed to maintaining a balanced budget this say this means restoration may take some time and in fact will probably have to be undertaken over a number of years works will be prioritized with the most urgent works being undertaken first and opportunities to restore damaged parks and gardens in other program works will be explored I want to thank the community for its patience as we work to restore our irrigation network and ensure our parks gardens and open space will remain tip-top into the future Thank You counselors all right if we can move to our reports now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you madam mayor to present the officer 's report infrastructure and operations starting with item 1 on page 1 of the ordinary ever again thank you can I have a seconder Thank You councillor saws these just relate to the minutes of the Tod mg from the 23rd of October myself and council Rabine were there and I think they 're a true and accurate record so I don 't believe there should be is there any discussion on these minutes yes count yeah thanks counselor Maliki no thanks met a man I think I just like to highlight an item that was discussed during that meeting and it acknowledged the great work that our communications team did during the monsoonal event earlier this year and some of the accolades they 've achieved since then so some of them are the the team were winners of the state prayer awards which then went on to the National Prayer Awards winner of the award for excellence at the Local Government Association Awards matter man and also finalists in the International Shorty Awards that were held in New York which was astounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize however were the first local government to make that that final of those awards should we say who beat us yeah you can me Nike the budget was a bit bigger I think yes it was Nike National International I think it was and also we 've got we also had our wonderful social media officer Connor Wallace go down and when the social media marketer of the year best emerging so it 's it speaks volumes about the bility in the drive and the passion that our team has and it 's good to see that they are recognized in this way so does that matter man I think also if you 'll indulge me for a second we could also talk about the exercise we had recently I think that should be in general yeah okay there weren 't the minutes fair enough thanks very much me Thank You counselor okay all right anyone else wishing to speak on the minutes of the meeting if not we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor against Council Maliki no your vote aye you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to item 2 which is the new lease for enterprise center can have someone move that cancel a move Thank You council Malkina do I have a seconder councillor Doyle thank you do I have a second oh I 'm sorry yes councillor door all right any discussions on that from the mover council Maliki no no do we have any discussion from counselors or any questions I might have made I 've got a few questions if I could okay council Rider I just want to clarify a few things probably the requesters from the towns or business center as in the organization and in the report it says names of parties with an on interest Michael Brennan is the chair so can I just clarify it 's the lease with Michael Brennan or the organization thank you can I have a through the chairs through the organisation the Townsville Business Development Center and the other one if I may is in the report it says this is basically a million dollar in-kind investment from us and I know in the report it says they 're going to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a million dollars do we get to see a business case or a strategic plan of what they 're actually or the intent is for the next five years because I understand they currently servicing training and giving advice to small business which I fully support but I just want to see that they presented us I think they 'd like to see before we invest a million dollars some sort business plane through the G I 'll be attending the AGM next wait where they 'll be providing that information where I can bring it to council sites there 's certainly a great business that looks after a lot of small businesses so they 've had a lot of damage during the floods as well we 've had the opportunity to insurance to do a lot of renovations there and bring that facility back up to scratch hence they applied for a loan and they need a new five year lease to have that loan approved so is it possible to hold over the decision until we see the business plan or the financials or some sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please Danny yeah as I attend the AGM next week that 'll be the business case I 'll be able to provide back to you guys from that could we change the officers recommendation subject to because you 're seeking an exemption from the local to the lease enabling us to deal directly rather than going out to a public tender or an EO I if we were to hold back to ensure that counsel has satisfaction that they do meet the requirements in terms of financial sustainability and have a suitable strategic plan in place before we enter into a lease arrangement is that what you 're seeking councillor otter yep that 's correct I just think for million dollar investment I just think we need to see probably more than this report councillors do you wish to hold this over to the January yes I 'll have a yes Tony madam mayor one of the ways forward and which may perhaps achieve councillor otters objectives is the decision to grant to apply the exemption isn 't a decision to grant the lease it would be appropriate I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers adopt the officers recommendation today and impose upon the granting of the lease perhaps through that a CEO being satisfied that an appropriate business case is being put forward by the tenant as I say the decision today doesn 't grant the lease it just enables the lease to be granted but if I may add something yes can 't thank you cancel Malkina um I haven 't met anyone from the TV DC oh I 've met one or two of the members there and it 's a great organization I 'm just wondering whether there 's any value in maybe talking to the chair coming to present to us next year on how they run the I guess the council Business Development Center and what what they 're providing for the council business community thank you I 'm seeing some nods from here I suppose the issue is if they what comes first the lease or the or the grant it 's a bit of chicken and egg and sorry threw the chair in here it says they are applying for a grant and knowing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to have a commitment in writing from the council if they 're doing a dollar-for-dollar or something like that or I would imagine so if that 's the case they would already have a business case ready to go for that grant so would have done a business case has they submitted for their grant for extra funding yeah and again the 200 thousands in coin for the buildings on what we would do as a market rental plus the rate through the young situation they yes it is in kind but it 's still something that we have to acquit in our annual report as part of our community service obligation Ling feed leasing period but I will support the will of the council I think Tony 's advice is appropriate advice of what you are not voting on the granting of the lease you are voting at the moment for the exemption from going to an expression of interest process so not more than comfortable in relation to requesting either the chair or the CEO of the organization coming to present in January but you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council Maliki no yeah I just thought obviously I think next year we should probably I think in this term we haven 't had anyone from T V DC present to us on here they 're traveling over there and considering the significant amount or being supportive or I think it would be beneficial to all of us and Athenian work in DITA all right I note that the report information states that the last lease had expired in 2009 and the two parties were not able to negotiate a new lease so they 've been working under a month among arrangement under the terms of the previous lease councillors I would I want some certainty because my my concern is if this group does not get the grants that it 's applying for I don 't want to I don 't want us to be again sometimes call it the soft touch where where all else fails come to council is there an ability under the lease arrangements for us to to to take the lease or dissolve the lease right based around failure funding fail yes or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to take the lease it runs month-to-month no but if a new lease is granted and the organization isn 't solvent or anything like that they would obviously but there are standard provisions in our leases that acts of insolvency constitute default which would give us the ability to terminate the lease if that 's what we minded to do obviously the organization would also have an opportunity to cure that default if and as I say if a this is not a decision to grant the lease so if as a result of a decision taken here today negotiations continue with the associate with the organization or the company so in respect of a fresh lease for two plus two plus one terms could be inserted into that document it clearly doesn 't exist now that is why the exemption is being applied for so terms could be inserted into that document to achieve anything within the law that you council has minded to do and so through the chair like I would definitely not like to stop anyone helping small businesses all I 'm asking is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grant and they need dollar for dollar they will have their business case ready so it 's not going to be at all I 'm saying is can they do what Mark said give us a presentation because I 'm excited about somebody helping the small businesses and I don 't want to be the one to stop it but for an amount that that size it is only 200 in coin but that 's a lot of money and all I 'm asking is for you know we talked about transparency it 's just somebody showing us the business case and then we can tell more people about what they do because all rights so is their ability as part of the officers recommendation to agree to one but insert a two whereby the at the January meeting we have a presentation from TBD see that includes outlining their strategic vision and business case and at that point we can conclude lease negotiations I think that might be would you be happy with that you think so prior to to signing off on the lease there needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we 'll then agree to the signing off half the lease would that be suitable for you counsel Reuter is there any other discussions yes counselor Jacob yes I just have one point to make on the two by two by one year and the officers recommendation does this take this particular decision-making process away from councilors and put it to the CEO for five years in two years time well this process come back so council can actually vote on this if they don 't adhere to their business case or you know something goes wrong with the organization I 'm just asking the question of the CEO count I 'll refer to our legal officer Tony blog please made you mad at me through the chair the two plus two plus one is a proposal to provide the lessee with an option to renew as is the case for any lacy option subject to the lessee not being in default they will be able to exercise that option if they choose to without having to come back for permission it 's a very fundamental basis of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that counsel is minded to provide them only a two-year lease then that would obviously be a challenge for their grant application process and as I understand it is likely to compromise the organization 's ability to obtain that grant yeah the whole purpose of the two plus two plus one means they are in control once the lease is granted of the site for the next five years of course if they slip into default council has an ability to terminate the lease or if indeed if they are in default when they come to exercise the option they are prevented from doing so okay thank you very much thank you councillors this is about the section and seeking exception under section 236 paraone B subsection 2 of the local government regulation regarding leasing of council property all right if we wish to add something extra we need to do so now it says council welcome thank you madam mayor the my concern is we give a sponsorship and grants or a lot of things and we put some conditions around that and I see this the same immolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty thousand dollars for an organization to support life support in relation to small business there 's a couple of things we need to look at is are we getting any branding out of that as a as a team member because we 're playing a major role and small business I think the question was are some days ago what are we doing for small business we 're doing many many things I mean from lighting to events to activation it 's manifest in so many different ways so the branding and I 'd like to see what the Constitution has in relation to or the mission statement in relation to what they 're trying to achieve because has been some comments made around the longevity of some of the tenants in these buildings where we want so many other buildings around the city that are looking for long term tenants the intent of startups and helping these people get up and running in their business and then moving on so we can help new ones get on their feet I 'm just a bit concerned that hell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we really doing what was the initial intent of this facility that 's my concern all right Thank You councillor door sorry madam chair if I can just go back to what the intent of the report is because I believe in any lease agreement those sorts of things can be discussed this is that it is we 're not discussing the intent of this particular report and I think we need to just focus on that to be honest Thank You councillor I would suggest that in light of the debate we add a second power in there requesting we agree to this and prior to any signing of lease that the either the CEO or whoever from TBD C presents at the January council meeting to outline their strategic plan and some of these questions we can ask directly and ensure that whatever support we do give that it 's recognised by the organisation and ensure that they are delivering on on their core business which is to act as an incubator for small business here in Townsville where councillors be happy with that I 'm just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close to our you know period that we can 't know this one would be okay oh this one would be okay yes okay thank you and we 're not its caretaker period begins on the 22nd of February okay thank you all right uh all right so can we have and cross my okay to council yeah all right would that suffice all right Thank You counselors so could that be read out for councillor Maliki no because he won 't have that on his report see can you please read that well could you read that out to Nia with the microphone could you use the microphone please number one is that the officers recommendation be adopted and number two prior to any signing of lease that at the January council meeting the council Business Development Center provided presentation regarding their business case and regard look all it regarding the operations and the strategic vision for the Townsville business center I think that 's more to the point if they 're pulling about of me all right thank you so they are the two recommendations now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same move up in seconder please if they were happy with that thank you we 'll put that to the vote all those in favor council maliki no are you in favor all right okay thank you that 's unanimous we 'll now move on to three the new lease for the united suburban suburbs Junior Rugby League do I have a mover again council maliki no thank you can I have a seconder please Thank You councillor Soares this one 's fairly straightforward the map was very good is there any discussion on this no all right we 'll put it to a vote all those in favor council maliki no are you in favor all right all right carried unanimously thank you let 's move on to now lease renewal for Townsville pole across club they 've been here for I think 42 years council Molokini I do wish to move this as

you carried unanimously we have now item five lease renewal for brothers Cricket Club do I have a mover Thank You councillor okay move councillor so seconded councillor maliki no do we have any discussion if not that one 's fairly straightforward they 're a very good local cricket club so council cook they 're excellent we 'll put that then to the vote all those in favor against cancel Molokini are you for or against thank you carried unanimously will now move on to item 6 which is the material change of use for the hotel shop healthcare services at 2 to 4 Ridge Drive Alice River so can I have one of the staff please if I can ask the Director of Planning ever through the chair item 6 is regarding this it 's a two-step process from planning application phase it 's an MCU for a tavern bottle shop pharmacy and medical center and the second element is for a subdivision to create two Lots over the subject site the site 's located on the corner of Regions Drive and Harvey Range Road on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me through the chair um I don 't think um are your microphones not on thank you is that better you hear me yes yeah besides a lots two hectares the subject sites actually has two zones over since the split zoning part of its neighborhood centers and the second component is a real residential zone public notification was undertaken between 12th of September and the 3rd of October during that time five submissions were received for objecting to the proposal and one supporting the proposal a number of issues were raised as part of the public notification process in the submissions in particular just outlining half a dozen of them one of them was in relation to the negative impact or the adverse impact on local character and rural residential lifestyle around the area the second component raised the question as to whether such a facility was needed in the area other issues raised around public disorder crime adverse impact on safety and security noise in packs was also raised and the other underlying issue was that was raises around the traffic and access pets on Ridge Drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the submissions received they provided a summary and recommendations part of the report I endorsed the officer recommendation and table for councils consideration thank you can I have someone move that we accept Thank You councillor Walker do I have a seconder councillor greeny all right council walk could you wish to speak on this soar thank you does anyone wish to speak against this or for this madam mayor if I can I did originally have some concerns with this application but I did meet with the planning team and because I had a few the local residents ring them and really had some concerns but I think the main concerns was whether will comply with the advertisement of the development application and they 've showed me all the the ads that went in the paper that showed me everything that was put up and I 'm confident that the phone number and email were on the actual advertisements the noise impact I had some issues with that because a clearly stated a desktop review was done the second time but again sitting with planning because I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have explained to me and I 'm actually happy now with what the second impact study you come up with the other one was my personal thing people said can they come back to Council and change this is probably another one more question I have to ask them sorry director is can they come back can they come back after we approve it or if we approve it can they trade beyond 00 p.m. and if they do come back do they have to come back to us as well as liquor licensing so through the chair the next process if they do try and amend their application is lodging a new application to seek an extension at a time or whatever changes they 're seeking depending on what they 're seeking you might need further investigations and that might be a further noise impact assessment required so yes I can come back to Council but in my it requires a new application and further consideration from a council perspective similarly from a liquor licensing perspective that I have to apply for the extension hours and similarly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensing as well I have a couple of questions if I may so if they do require longer operating times does that become an MCU impact accessible through code through the chair it might come back as an amendment to their existing approval so it 'd be code assessable through that process they 'd still be required to provide an updated noise impact assessment and there 'd be a determination in terms of what impact that would actually be that would be an officer 's determination not a council determination correct that that is my understanding we can we can request code assessable to come to Council for decision making can we not trip weekend and if that 's requested we 'd bring that up to Council for its consideration all right so council Rider if you want some surety in terms that even after the election who 's ever here has a line of sight on this can we request that any changes to this application even at code assessable code assessable applications come back to council for for determination so can we make that do we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was through the chair Olympic condition it 'd be a separate part to the whole recommendation so part a would be as the officer recommends with all the approvals and the conditions attached the approval and then Part B would be separate to it all our requesting that if there 's any amendments to the or changes to the application that that be brought to Council yes and then I 'll go to cancel it my problem with that is it when they go and pull these conditions the file is that gonna be attached because we went through this on another project where they did come back and change the conditions on a road and there 's no line of sight on that so you want to make sure that this is attached to that document so when staff go to it they know they have to bring it back here how do they how does that go from these minutes on to that document I might ask the director if he could please comment through the chair how the recommendations would go on file in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward similar to this proposal you 've noted the officers report it refers to previous applications that were made regarding the site and house those previous applications lapsed so through the planning application process County Council officers that do go back through the history of that site and they 'd go back through the spread through this approval and they 'd note that there is a recommendation to bring that back to councils consideration so ensure they 'll go to the they 'll go to the minutes and check that what the outcome was from this item so through the chair the minutes are actually put on the file as well okay that 's my original question is if that was actually attached to this form are you happy with that council council clarify in regards to the wording of what you just said that somebody 's gonna write that that 's exactly what I intend to do Thank You counsel support counselor Jacob yes through the chair I just have one question it 's on item number 10 on on-site sewage disposal I just like to ask a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our normal sewerage system for this particular development I think that would be a director of infrastructure and I have my belief it 's significantly a long way from sewage I could I ask where is the closest sewage point for this development would it be Kalinda chase can someone give me an answer yes if I could all right so counselor did you hear that it would be Kalinda chase yes I did actually and that is a considerable distance away from this particular one because we may have this occurring in the future in other locations like to occur in places like that that 's the reason I raise the question the technology around the disposal now septic systems is quite sophisticated I would hope that whatever is put on this site would be suitable for for commercial use yeah thank you yes cancel Martina I thought my quick question one related to car park and paragraph 18 it talks about 63 car parking spaces including disables provided with stage a so although it 's free from stage a which I believe was the first part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 22 provided or the health services that the total of 85 for the whole project overall so through the chair he requires the car park to refer to let 's table in front of council the moment which is the MCU for the tavern the the pharmacy that the Medical Center in the bottle shop okay simple maintenance yeah I just wanted to clarify that 's all because it says page a in there 63 to service the hotel stage a but then on the actual drawings it 's talked about stage D car park back to the car park page B car park that 's all so just wanted to make sure that they were going to roll it okay to for all that parking I have to say counselor that on one of the photographs they have horses tethered at the front door I don 't know how many car parks they take up three on paragraph 25 on page 20 it talks about the refuse facility this is normally a performance we put on these commercial businesses of these Orestes facilities to provide it sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just general things that people use I 'm at the front I 'll ask the director to answer that so through the chair just wanted to clarify is that reference to condition 25 briefings facilities and has to be undertaken in relation to our code within our city plan I normally that would be in an accessible area but away from I guess the public vision just for an amenity perspective but it needs to comply with the the revelant provisions of the the planning so councilor the refuse the bins need to be well away from public where public may eat or congregate and they need to ensure that the bins whether they 're industrial or not are sealed correctly and are disposed off appropriately madam mayor got one more comment sure his rupert 's would Community Hall has now been closed since last December and we talked a lot about resilience and gathering places a lot of people will be hesitant on this but I think it will be a great opportunity for the community to have a place together because the days of volunteer labor are gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to volunteer burnout our team our community team are now working with them to still get that center open and I don 't believe it will impact I think it 'll be a value add to this community because they need to gather somewhere and we 've all proven that in since the floods all right Thank You councillor council would you like us to place the second part under the recommendations to include that any changes to this to this application okay I can read that are you happy with that yes think it so is the mover and seconder happy with that amendment yeah so that will now become the substantive all right counselors we have a mover and seconder they are the recommendations now coming to Council at a map I mean yes again Tony could I ask you to read that out please our number one is that the officers recommendation be adopted and number two that any

you that 's fine um is it Alister would you like to come forward thank you I 'm sorry Alistar everyone is in the spotlight thank you madam and through the chair just like to present the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars this round of grant closed on the 30th of October and the three that presented were followed the eight week process of eligibility and assessment and the total value of these grant sees forty nine thousand four hundred and twenty four dollars in cash and an eighteen thousand one hundred and sixty three dollars and five cents as a fee waiver before the Civic Theater and if the councillors are interested I 'm happy to talk about and one of the particular applications recommendations it does does anyone have any questions on any of the the grants council Jacob thank you sorry no okay anyone yes no matter may I just thought it was important that the grants officer if the council wishes to hear about them the background to some of the grants because I think it 's important particularly with the one where we 've got a social based on a social outcome that we I suppose explore that further in the sense that it it is a great outcome for the community and it 's positive in that sense building social capacity and capability is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably like to hear about the first one if we all right thank you the first one if you could please Alistair the others I think a fairly explain a truth absolutely thank you wonder men through the chair so the first application is from South Pacific Taekwondo and looking to develop on deliver on a project or initiative engaging indigenous young women aged 13 to 18 years old in a nine-month program of Taekwondo so they 're working in collaboration with stars stars a country were two currently running a mental program with three of the schools so double check through throwing our Pimlico and Heatley high school and they are running a very successful program in those schools South Pacific Taekwondo have been partnering with stars in a voluntary capacity offering ad hoc Taekwondo lessons and sessions for these young women and they came to the grants team to see if we could help in terms of enhancing their capacity to continue to deliver a bit more a long term project because they felt that the outcomes for these young women in particular would be far greater received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never applied for a grant before they came and met with the grants team myself to seek advice on how best to do that and to look at the priorities that council wear and championing through the grants program and really have taken on all the advice given from the grants program and and submit a really excellent application so the the program seeks to work with 35 young women who identified through the Stars mentor program over a nine-month period where they would participate in two to three sessions a week of Taekwondo as part of the funding these young women would actually become lifelong members of the Taekwondo club and the idea being that that gives them an opportunity to to stay within this sort of a an initiative long beyond the nine months we know that I guess the way that stars work they work with young women who have been identified in the indigenous Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander community and are at risk I guess of struggling in terms of schooling and Outsiders going further in society so some of this things that they have identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 percent of indigenous girls complete secondary school education now in 2018 Stars Foundation and of all the young girls involved in their mentoring program ninety seven percent of them completed year 12 and then 81 percent and went on to education employment or training post so the statistics in terms of stars impact make them a great organization to partner with we also know that young women in from Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander backgrounds are you know I guess some statistics for you here eight times more likely to be the subject of substantiated abuse or neglect three times more likely to experience sexual violence two times more likely to drop out of high school and 30% 36% likely to be employed now there 's been a lot of investment in young men from these cultures and seen some great improvements but less so in terms of young women and that 's where stars also steps in and feels that there 's a gap that they can meet and so partner with South South Pacific Taekwondo it 's hope that the Taekwondo will be the vehicle so not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional factor it 's actually about the sport as a vehicle for things like resilience sense of community peer support connection to others and hopefully giving these young women aspirations long beyond the nine months of the program itself and actually going on to encourage others for their own community younger younger women and older women alike to kind of yes to make a difference so that 's why we thought it was a really excellent project something new and really embeds the new grants program what it 's about in terms of good things happening in our community that we want to support they 're bringing better outcomes in the long term so it 's a long time investment suppose we look at it as a preventative not a reactive measure thank you thank you so if I can just quickly yeah all right you go first thank you madam at thanks Alice um it 's really exciting to hear about the potential that this is one of the things that I would like to see and maybe I might not even be here for her but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from Stars and South Pacific just to get their anecdotal evidence about particularly when they 've actually finished their nine months so through the chair what we actually engaged with South Pacific was to look at getting some baseline measures at the start of the middle and the end of the project so as well as the anecdotal evidence we can really start to see some some tangible outcomes these youngins so nothing that 's so too clinical but really looking at well-being measures that we can see where did they start how did they progress through the program to really give some baseline data because South Pacific want to broaden this project to engage young women in different schools not just of Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander background as well and they would look to use this as a way of seeking funding from either state or federal levels as a kind of an entry point and again that was another real positive about them engaging the project was understanding that this is a hand up not hand out we 're looking at capacity building in a community and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just putting application in for infrastructure grant I think through state funding to improve their club so then engage community in a broader sense as well so and lots of positives and we 'd hope to go to track this through and maybe even look at using them as an example of the new grants program and someone who with no experience coming through to see a project right through to the end so I 'm happy to present that back in about nine or ten months on thanks very much congratulations for them Thank You counselors any other questions before I ask my Nia 's council cook it 's not a question it 's just the fact that programs like this not only prevent disengagement from education it also prevents and stops and young people from entering the youth justice system which is a very very important factor and I think this program along with other ones such as booyah etc are going a long way to doing it especially in today 's climate so well done Thank You council the door madam chair I do just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about embedding behavioral changes so it 's using sport as a vehicle and a vehicle only in that sense but it 's you know that instilling and improving focus on concentration mental health and well-being and building overall confidence and character so I think when we step back and we look at what are the underlying reasons for the delivery of these programs one that 's the sport is the vehicle not the outcome thank you I do have a couple of questions and comments is this program run in conjunction with contour stars foundation it 's their stars are in partnership so they 're identifying the young women for the nine months as well as providing transport to and from the alright and I would assume that if there are set of rules and guidelines that have people step outside of that they 're no longer facilitated on the program yacht imagines so that would be a case for stars to manage that the the young women entering into the program so it 'd be part of any similar extracurricular activities that would be involved all right the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branding before Townsville City Council is that branded as part of the group who support the foundation it will be through the South Pacific Taekwondo so it 's the they 're the applicants they 're just partnering with stars and so when we put together our based on the recommendation and approval at the report we would look to build that into the funding agreement and with South Pacific looking for any specifics around acknowledgement of counselors involvement can I ask why stars didn 't come to us as a funder rather than Tyre Taekwondo I think because South Pacific had identified this need themselves that they were heavily involved in the community in other areas and so they felt that this was something they wanted to offer to stars in terms of to increase the capacity of stars I guess via South Pacific as opposed to stars coming to us directly alright the these sort of programs are of any value they should meet a criteria under federal and state counselors we only collect three percent of the taxation revenue and we 're increasingly being asked more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the gap because federal and state governments aren 't supporting some of these projects I 'd like to think we only needed to do this for 12 months and if the project is a success other levels will take it on or philanthropic group can be found to support this I think I think we are enables and there are times that we may also need to step back and ensure other levels of government accept their responsibility madam mayor if I can that 's exactly the purpose of the project and it was clearly identified with the grants officer that this is a stepping stone and a starting point hence the term project I think I knew more than any and councillor Walker in this room know that this City Council has long been a supporter of youth development within their city and it was a loss to this community several years ago when those sorts of programs cease I 'm celebrating the fact that we 're actually stepping back into that arena as a stepping stone not that not too full on let 's keep going state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take management take responsibility this is a stepping stone and I commend this council for taking that initiative so the the the the the Southern Pacific Taekwondo understand it is only for 12 months good all right thank you so we 've had a mover and seconder for the report all right can I ask council doll you moved council rider you second comments yep is councillor Doyle able to be the person to ring this group when if we vote for it because I 'd like a counselor to actually probably bring the group and tell them that councillors voted for this project stars or Southern Pacific South Pacific here the epic South Pacific or on a council door can ring let me to be fine or I can say if she wishes all right I can put this to the vote please all those in favor councillor Maliki no thank you against carried unanimously will now look at the route of funding and I would assume council right oh this is yours would you like to move this report I would love to move this thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments on the report yes madam mayor just one comment that to our delight and very sad though that we actually received a hundred and seventy thousand dollars worth of applications and we could only commit to forty thousand the the committee we had around the table had to make some hard and fast decisions but they weren 't taken lightly and a lot of reading had to be done and I commend the team of the rate of committee that I 've got this year and I 've had for a couple of years and also the staff how they put it together and it was quite easy this year and it was well presented and it made us it was easy to make the decision very hard though to knock back others which we 've said to them there are other grant opportunities like you said too before they state federal and we do have another bucket of money so we did make some recommendations for those people as there are many many good projects Thank You councillor if there 's be no further comment we 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aye against carries unanimously let 's move on now to item 12 which is the budget variance report now we are moving towards the mid-year financial review as part of today 's meeting this is for October and I 'll seek someone to move this report

Fawlty just the annual report oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you yes the annual report and the financial statements a counselor I 'd like to move the annual report if I may do I have a seconder Thank You councillor qu ladies and gentlemen today on behalf of Council and the executive team I am pleased to present the 2018 19 annual report can I say there 's been some conjecture in the community that we weren 't going to produce this I don 't know why yes can I say this report highlights our commitment to responsible financial management while sharing both our achievements and highlights of the Townsville City Council financial statements in 2018 19 in the middle of the with the floods and the and the way staff had to manage our funds we were still able to deliver a budget surplus a balanced budget and kept rates obviously at 1.9 percent to 1819 due to the unprecedented monsoonal event council was granted a two-month extension to finalize our audit and our and our financial statements counselors were many of our senior management who are affected by the monsoonal event and through the recovery process the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to also commit to businesses usual was a feat in itself the Queensland Audit Office signed off on our financial statements on the 26th of November and the audit committee endorsed the annual financial statements on the 21st of November the report here commits council to building our future while maintaining fiscal responsibility and carrying out our core features ladies and gentlemen there is a lot to be said here in the budget insight in the Financial Review and can I note that some of the things that I don 't think the community understands is firstly our community service obligations we have budgeted for one point one four nine million in that just around waist alive and this is only in waste as a result of the monsoonal event our community service obligation blew out the 3.5 million and that was based around allowing people to be able just to to dispose of their waste as part of the flood into our waste stream now we didn 't charge people for that but obviously there 's a responsibility for us to set those funds aside do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million on grants to community organisations that is an extraordinary amount but for example we provide halls leases to groups for one dollar a year but the value of that has to the commercial value of that has to be placed in our books and that is valued alone as ten point seven million dollars so councillors you know when we grant a lease or support that that has a value and it 's a value to our community can I also note that areas such as water our community obligation there is quite large more than 2.7 million in community service obligations so we literally write-off nearly over a million dollars just for clubs to be able to water their fields which is why the ability for us to bring non potable water into our sporting precincts is so important counselors there 's a lot to be said in this report a lot of the good we do in our community the number of parks we 've upgraded the number of off-leash areas have grown the number of what else roads that we 've that we 've paved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our major investments along for the important pipeline we invested 85 million last financial year in the Horton pipeline we replaced a thousand water meters we invested 4.7 million in fixing holes maintenance holes mains to property killer property connects 12 months how we 've invested the community 's funds to ensure that there is a return in insuring assets are maintained to ensure that we we bring forward works as I said such as the Horton pipeline and manager we 've got for example 16 units in the community we manage more than 1,700 kilometres of road nearly 1,800 kilometers of local Road we look after dog parks we have 383 parks we have to look after it 's a massive organ it 's a massive community and this annual report highlights what we do and what staff do for us I want to I want to thank the directors the general managers and of course the CEO in terms of putting the report together but more importantly counselors for ensuring that we maintained a strong and vibrant community and they did this during difficult times the LDC for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that investment into future proofing and protecting our community was a major investment and while it was delivered over a number of financial years it was delivered by and large by the people sitting around in this room we 're thinking about our future and I commend the community it 's not a big document it 's not the 330 pages we used to put out it is a it is a document of a hundred and four pages it is a document that clearly highlights what we are doing as an organization journalists it 's very easy to read a lot of it for grams there that will make it very easy for you to do some excellent articles ladies and gentlemen I commend this report to Council councillor kun do you wish to comment considering you were part of the Audit Committee excuse me thank you madam mayor um I too would like to pass on my thanks to the staff who prepared the document so the document alone I would like to pass on my thanks to the finance team and the marketing communications team who take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually put it into a document that our community can consume and understand and it has been an amazing 12 months to think that the business-as-usual that was achieved was done so in such trying circumstances I think that cannot be highlighted enough so not only just for the document itself but what the document says and the story that it tells about our community and our resilience and where we have come to in the last four years as an organisation that we are prepared for the next four and the next forty years so thank you to the CEO if you could pass that on to the staff thank you can I just give you quickly some highlights so it makes it easier for the journalists there so we upgraded Heatley Park Charles Maroni Park uplands where Rotary Park as well as I think Northshore was in that this financial year we also have have significant refurbishment to the Animal Care and Adoption Center it 's in a far better position than what it was the Northshore youth hub including the skate park obstacle course

thank you to all the staff so we have a mover and seconder seed you wish to make any comments on the report or the financial statements only I think yourself and I thank the councillors for their

two point two three can I 'll move that seconder was counselor Walker Thank You counselors this has been a very long meeting however the mid-year budget review councils I 'm pleased to present this to Council all of you have been involved in the meetings around the mid-year budget review I think we 've had at least two meetings of all counselors so the opportunity has been there for all of you to interrogate and investigate the review aims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent throughout the year it demonstrates councils hard work in ensuring in ensuring how we focused on rebuilding our infrastructure and natural environment after this year 's unprecedented monsoonal event council is committed to building for our future and remains invested in providing projects that future-proof our city and resilience we are able we 've invested heavily in community infrastructure we 've reduced our debt and we 've kept our rate rises down to 2% this year the review focused on council maintaining a balanced budget and I can say councillors in light of the difficulties we 're having as a result of accessing disaster funding relief arrangements the staff are doing an excellent job we will have an operating surplus of ultimately 3.2 million at the end of this financial year we are investing in a smarter faster better council doing the basics and we 're delivering work more than four hundred and thirty million dollars worth of infrastructure investment over the financial this financial year counselors we know that this could change depending on the outcomes of some of the funding arrangements but can I say I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still in a strong and very financially stable position at this point of time and while some of you may not be here at the end of the financial year to see the outcome I want to thank you for being a part of the process can I commend the CEO and all the finance and all the staff to you Stacy and your staff thank you very much it 's a it 's a great outcome at this point in time so shy and to the ladies to back and to Julia you 've done a great job in delivering this thank you very much for that counselors it is now nearly half an hour later than what we thought we would be open for would you like to comment on the mid-year review policy I did say to you I 'll to talk about those yeah in particular now that we have a some attendees in the public gallery so firstly in relation to the indigenous it was considered during confidential and and the decision was made to make it public I think one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thank the mayor and the counselors there was a commitment made some three years ago now I know it 's been a stronger commitment amongst a number of you for a number of years and it 's for council to play a bigger role in a in fact the lead role is correct counselor to play a lead role in indigenous employment in the nurturing and supporting indigenous businesses the identification and support of indigenous apprentices and trainees as a part of our everyday business and I 'm extraordinarily proud of the efforts of the team in particular when it comes to the result of this panel this is the culmination of running the first council LED indigenous business forum that had a remarkable turnout it is emblematic of the behavior of our personnel and the way we have encouraged indigenous business to come to council and more broadly to be a part of the business sector within Townsville and the region the fact that we had 60 applicants for our indigenous panel and these are niche businesses that because there are also a number of indigenous businesses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I would argue that we are now close to having over 90 indigenous businesses in Townsville registered either on the indigenous business panel or on our broader panels and a number of those have come out of the projects that this council has supported and in particular the Horten pipeline and the CBD utilities and the list goes on so before I speak about the mid-year budget review I thank you all but in particular I thank my officers for their commitment to ensuring that we are representative of the community and staff numbers now matter may reflect the appropriate percentage and that 's a considerable change over the last four years so thank you for that in relation to the mid-year budget review the commitment of this organization at the best that the counselors was to ensure that we maintained a financially sustainable council we didn 't at the beginning of last financial year anticipate the flood that we had again I commend the officers and then the mayor and the counselors for their support and and and I commend the officers and I made the point earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,500 staff a number of them that were affected and yet continued to do their job not only during the event and the majority of our officers continue to do recovery whilst they maintain business as usual we have had to use some of our operating expenditure and capital program in anticipation of the RFA funding and will continue with those submissions so the fact that we managed to achieve a surplus of 3.2 million dollars allowing for this year quantum of dollars that we 've delivered not only in capital program but in our maintenance program and in recovery across the board I couldn 't be prouder of the organization and madam mayor I commend you and the counselors for your support of the organization it is just another great achievement by the organization thank you thank you thank you for that councillors general business any before I close with a Christmas message you nearly forgot no I 'm gonna leave that one for next year when it 's on the actual minutes of the report I think man now what I wanted to highlight was that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few years has just been completed in the Nathan Street beautification project so it 's a wrapped-up limit but the contractor on site recently along with the OID staff member who Alma Comrie and the project 's come along even better than we all could have expected it 's got a lot of positive comments from the community the the blokes on site that will work on the project we 're getting horns beat that on passengers wave and people that walk in the foot but the new footpaths along they 're commenting every day so it 's it 's really changed the that stretch of road there was 10,000 plantings along there there 's you know two hectares a garden frontage footpaths parking bay is over 150 trees so it was a significant project quite a bit of investment on behalf of Council and the state government but it 's really made sense of pride in the community around there and it 's made one of our main thoroughfares of the city look you know a hundred times better than what it did so thanks for your support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handle the contractors thanks very much and till colleagues here thanks a lot for your support Thank You counsel I know the community there sometimes as you 've invested in Heatley Park and those things that social infrastructure can go a long way in endearing community pride alright councillors we do have another meeting after this so I will be brief can I wish everyone in the room and all the staff and CEO all you all your senior management that are here a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year we won 't be meeting again till January and I just want to say it 's been a difficult year and I want to thank all of you both counselors and staff and CAE for the tremendous work you 've done over the last 12 months the I know we 're talking about bushfires and there are there are some significant events that are happening around Australia but for me home is home there was still some issues for us in our community and I know that staff are trying to deal with that as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some of our staff it 's been a tough year it was tough just even to get the current the previous budget into balance with everything that happened and it 's been tough for a lot of us I look forward to the break as I 'm sure all of you do and it will be a very interesting start again to 2020 as we move into election mode here it 's all right it 's all right majora with that I want to thank all of you for the efforts you have put in this year it 's been it 's been difficult at times we 've had to make some tough decisions but we 've all done that as as a well informed all of you is well informed members of council and I want to

though what makes up was that we same with nonprofit small businesses they be very brief is not profits going through they 're not profits number one didn 't get me anywhere near as much but obviously the impact was tell it yeah but there 's been very few of you can read several nice turns but I suspect pretty stiff odds ratios strong regards with rats and Everett better yet you look about well

demand people 's feels like they 're chanting thank you thank you any other questions sorry that makes more than I can say door yeah just wanting to comment on the impact your positive impact of business mentoring and coaching I 've seen that on first hand for some a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have positive feedback thank you all right thank you David and you think could you thank the team in councilor Co the work your committees been doing it 's a it 's an important part of the recovery process Thank You counsels there are no other presentations if I may I 'll rise to now give a Merril minute about our trying to revitalize our city image counselors as part of a commitment to the people of Townsville this council has been very active in rebuilding after the monsoonal event generating new economic development initiatives that will create new jobs revitalize to the CBD and supporting the creation of the new stadium precinct we 've invested in events such as never in Townsville it 's all of the home that have been very successful and brought much-needed life and economic activity to our city post the monsoon next year we will see the opening of the new North Queensland Stadium with Elton John as the headline act a new home for the Cowboys and other events that more than likely will bring people into our CBD area work will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stadium while most members of our local community and businesses have embraced the efforts to improve our city 's image it has been disappointing that some building owners are allowing their buildings to become dirty dilapidated and in obvious needs need of repair this is detracted from our city image and has had negative impacts on businesses nearby their neglect is costing us jobs and making it harder for us to attract investment to Townsville overall we 've been working closely with these building owners over an extended period to address the situation and while there has been some robust discussion along the way unfortunately we 're not seeing the improvements we 'd hoped for well quite frankly ladies and gentlemen enough is enough as mayor I will not stand by and allow these recalcitrant building owners to get away with this any longer today I stand before Council with a proposal to introduce a tough new local law giving us the power to clean up these derelict buildings and strengthen our ability to remove graffiti the proposed law is very similar to the local all used to clean up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to a straight interest check and public consultation before it can be enacted will require building owners to ensure their building is maintained so that its appearance does not detract from other buildings in the area the property owners who do not clean up run-down buildings will face fines of over 26,000 the the new local law will also give Townsville City Council 's the right to ask courts to order property owners to clean up their derelict properties once the proposal is approved at today 's council meeting the next step for us is to commence consultation with the state government to obtain their approval and also to begin a public consultation phase for introducing the proposed law statutory time limits means sadly it 's likely to take six months before this law is in place my message to the owners of these derelict buildings is quite clear they should do the right thing by the community now and use the time to clean up their act and not wait until they are forced to do so a copy of the draft local law and supporting attachments summarizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselors I 'd like to recommend and I 'll move the council result to propose to make local law number 8 unsightly buildings 2019 and a subordinate local law number 8 unsightly buildings 2019 I say I move that could I call for a second a councillor a bum is there as secondary do you wish to speak would you like to speak on a band thank you thanks for the opportunity on behalf of the residents of division 7th of is my represent think he 's Preakness like the law to the chamber today men we are of course a proud City one who takes pride in our home where we live but certainly there is that minority the Sun Lord 's and the dilapidated building owners out there to conduct little or no mate and sonic properties and bring the look and feel of our city down much the extra for the community quite frankly they 're having lenders it 's no secret I 'm a strong proponent of solving the issues as well seeks to address and it will be wonderful to see this for an action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said is the first step and the next we 'll be hearing from the community no doubt there would be concerns raised throughout this process however it must be said that this floor is owned for those who do not take care than buildings and leave them looking down licked dilapidated and are ultimately a partner city I throw my support behind you small thank you thank you do I have any other councillors who wish to speak on this none right Thank You councillor so I 've moved and we have a seconder if there is no further discussion we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you um I 'll now move to I will seek the indulgence of counsel I would like to begin with item 25 the material change of use MC u-19 backslash triple O 's 7 if I can because we have representatives who wish to make a submission for and the submission not supporting the proposed changes if I can if I can call upon the the Acting Director of Planning please you quick summary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much Neil what I might do is now the consultant is BNC for the landowner and we have two submitters are both submitters here or just one thank you would you like to come forward please and then state your reasons and could you please for the purpose of the minutes give us your name thank you thank you for allowing us the opportunity to address the council well it 's a little bit daunting but bear with me I know I know you must say normally we do this at committee but this has come through Maine council let me start by being very clear that we are not opposed to the expansion of the Kirov Empire I have lived in that area since 1974 and I have been a direct neighbor of the caravan park since 1988 I have seen caravan park owners come and go over the years so I do support small business and I do feel that it 's great to see our local community moving forward but there 's but however qualifications in environment laws Town Planning or such like however I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know other lenders naturally for hunt I do remember how the breath used to be when the caravan park owners have changed hands in 2009 the owners that were in place at the time I believe and I 'm going to submit to counsel that I believe operational works were carried out at the rear of that caravan park unlawfully I 've tried to collect google images capturing some of the excavations and I was successful in finding some on Google Earth you can actually see the excavator in progress you can actually see now the map the letting naturally important how the water flowed if that 's not mine if that owner decided he wanted to reclaim more land at the back of his caravan park and decided to fill in that took walkways and create a drain point that pushed the water off his land subsequently eroding out at the time it was done right at the end of his time at the caravan park and our planes fell on deaf ears as the years have gone on what has happened is erosion has taken its course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually has a fence line that no longer has any soil under it part of our fence line and now one foot shorter than they used to be the water logs and settlement is going through our block straight in white oak increase and strain out on to Great Barrier Reef now I 'm not post to the expansion but in the plans that the developer has put forward and they are quite comprehensive and I don 't have a degree but I can read and they keep referring to the existing trade points the utilizing the existing threats in place to the then the caravan park that existing grain at the north end of the caravan time I believe was not put in place correctly to begin with so you can understand and I 'm sure as homeowners ourselves that it suddenly you hear moves that tell you the effluent is going to be a lot more and a lot more water coming through allow them start ringing this is going to get close I 've read the plans I have given them to a friend to really who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too is concerned that there are not good enough measures and waste and they are lying on something that was put there I don 't like to begin with ok I 'll be faster look should the council have review to accept this proposal I further submit that in doing so surely it 's not unreasonable for a certified one point person in the council to at least come and talk to us have a look at the erosion that 's taking place and investigate into what those of donation operational Webster took place in 2009 because the existing owner that wants to expand will utilize all of this isn 't interested in our complaints we can do it it 's not our problem in a nutshell the plan intends to use those drains and which submit those drains actually went looking properly in the first place and it 's not unreasonable for us to close an applicant to carry out I 'd like to see they carry out such work to remediate the damage that is already sustained to our downstream properties and to prevent any further damage or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you very much sorry Tony is there a representative of the landowner thank you if you 'd like to come forward and please state your name for the might take up too much of your time today okay what has starting wide mala two issues that have been proposed early yet tonight as well is your submission process is that really it as an adjournment be vigilant without this be proposed next book to him and the public involved process rather the ice discipline is the main technical success it 's probably important in this instance to note that these issues which troops they 're issues that were identified frankly we 're out to the process even before the development application are starting to being drafted to that and events were literally yep he was out later significant amount of time and resources to prepare basically a integrated environmental management plan throughout the coming months process but with what was written to get to the point where we have here today these reports are basically seek to identify incessant bit again any impacts with the development of the environmentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance issues to ensure best outcomes achieved priceless is bothering us due diligence couponer in Travelers Cheques prostrate levels and assessment and firstly being young kids engaging had mystical terrifying experience appointment compared with reference and complaint they supported by the engagement measures detailed modeling reports I 've been clicking an addressing issues such as thoughtless form of management wise management intend to multiply advice water and storm approaches that in controlling atmosphere secondly has been councilors internal rough mistakes in planning of intercepting little closer today and accept me the magic strategies performed too many issues probably to a more details pointed within the states involved specifically the Platinum one responses they 've been back to all the insurance and vetting checked around posters wisely my rock was worth fair play to see which they 've accepted we 're going to compose Macau from mention an issue with very responsible supported approval link to a writer extending the wrong woman and those primitive are for any planets which relate to environment to the road ninety two feeds on the important protection as a little to this poem has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to develop new system system which of water inside of the history was formed a decision and identification but does invited vary with a stands for council computers it 's really a very very edges of the Welcome they his breast address the issues the major purpose managed impacts in the joint Lane and the important issue themselves isn 't a choice that we have to gets might get decide which the one get out of the breast to this point that 's where they going to demonstrate this most important council compartment as Lawrence is not provided and worthy it 's worth noting as well that certainly more this project actually before hunts the opportunity to define addresses the issues of my object I 'm elected without approval the conditions of approval as we 've seen and will achieve this and they reverse themselves account for an outcome as opposed to what 's appropriate this levels or doesn 't occur unless informal issues have to manage which is reflective thank you all right um I 'll ask cancers do they have any questions of either this applicant or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mic on I 'm in relation to the submitter talking about erosion issues surrounding the propping up just so I can understand if I 'm a man what residents usually referring to doing in relation to which he lives in here excellent obviously a report here can you advise us where your property is to the property to do [Music] [Music] so you 're yes so are you were living 13 along the road hello can see where they 're talking about it does should open the flood mapping here there is an existing project in the funds beyond around natural property the X part of it the northwest I guess firstly that drain was playing was that improve on p.m. initially and secondly that drains into flows straight into there probably a number two thing is that it is proponent network with these boys who to talk about mediate any chiu-hung so yes so if I could ask the proponents representative if I could answer that [Music] Oh second he the submitters raised some issues variant um the issue of flooding on to their properties homeless development in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with these course to mitigate this these reported issues around the flooding in erosion of their property Thomas proposed about thanks peso that 's something that we we are possibly able to put into the condition donkeys what 's very neat just from your clarification coming yeah could I ask the director of planning through his chair I refer the councillor and council to condition 9 of the the report refers to stormwater drainage so in particular actually refers to the stormwater management plan submitted by the applicant it refers to the council 's healthy water water codes as well as the Townsville city plan but more importantly the the first two lines of that conditioner of the most important aspects an appropriately qualified and experienced registered professional engineer of Queensland must certify that the stormwater drainage achieves the outcomes of all of those policies and plans so if it doesn 't achieve that then you 're not gonna have a registered engineer signing off on on the outcome thank thank you who 's the director just if I could make me apologize or duck I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stormwater management plan is will that help address this because I guess manager through through the chair to achieve the stormwater outcomes it needs to satisfy the recommendations and the outcomes of the stormwater management plan has been submitted it needs to satisfy the Town Council City Planning requires from a stormwater drainage perspective as well as the healthy water codes policies as well so in particular the stormwater management plans identified as part of the MCU approval but also as part of the operational works and the operational works can 't commence until those sort of management plans and all those policy objectives are met [Music] one which is normal the management thank you I 've got canceled oil and then councillor Walker councillor door and I guess I 'm ready man I suppose I have 1974 ringing in my ear but the submitter has been on up that property for that length of time that obviously has historical and and lived experience in relation to the effect and I might drink has anybody actually visit their property to see the impacts of that one today Thank You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process because moving toward it were council to approve this you know it will potentially have further impacts than our three state that we have engineers and we have strong we have reports but we also have never experienced true councillor door I 'll also throw to the fact that this was considered as well as it was referred to the Department of State Development manufacturing infrastructure and planning who also have a place some conditions on there what I think we could suggest is a meeting with our engineers to explain the codes and what the requirements will be on the developer or on the applicant as part of this process that may go a long way into giving some some clarity in the situation to the submitters so we could we could ensure that that takes place okay I 'll go to councillor walk and then councillor bringing think man the revert page 61 section 9 book that we talked about rose women of course need to book an event platform in vegetation which is critical in Malaysia momentum this if in the event that this for proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is heavily conditioned in relation to the revegetation of the 61 section online I notice that a couple of section lines a couple of 16 pins Gordon 's with special condition 6.4 yeah Chuck just be mindful it 's not just about a rose so just about how long stormwater meant because the whole circle works around that so they 're all critical to if event this for the proved that revegetation is the critical point in business and I see the state actually pushes heavily on on this sort of bomb condition fish is a wetland then it must have been conditioned in a place to managing their storm water and waste water on site which was critical I think this list of a conversation from the submitters that there has been some Overland flows at a point in so looks like this has been reachable group redirected back internally to be many seen a allophone event because I just notice matter bear that in the dryer has a low flow drainage point and a high flow so it 's interesting I said it tanks to 22,000 leaders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interesting to see how that revegetation interfaces with those low flows and high flow arm outlets I think that 's critical for the stimulus can be aware of and then it being practically informed together who work from an environmental perspective I think that 's very important for them alright I again I think we may refer back to our engineers if I can ask yes Leslie chairman if I could just point out we do have one of our very own re P Q qualified engineers here who 's been dealing with this application who would be able to answer some of the technical questions if you [Music] yes I did take the kid that was positioning and make sure that it employs their standards and our water quality quality objectives that people that has taken immaturity before it completely saw which similar Oxfam is what they dump the stains the boats not leaves out right we 'll be looking at further looking at some what work has happened that 's changed the eventually change we 're more flow who has been at me I 've been looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step back to the 2009 on tool to at the moment time to talk to investigating where life is happening but there 's everything you can see on the corner of Jalan Optima trying to the place where it was carried out when that wants a much more but that that will be picked up as part of the operational work so we fix that fix that issue and pull that back nvidia that 's nice I 'd let me sum up your comments here you you do agree with the submitter their mo they may have been work done without proper operational so and you believe that if by working together on this on this project we may be able to relieve some of the issues they 're currently having cool thank you very much council greenie yes thinking about of me as a counselor who is actually experiencing this and it 's ongoing with this situation I think that you 're completely aware of madam that in college division and the same thing it 's happening my question to council staff is what are the checks and balances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Chow if these conditions are oh it 's no how we make sure that they carried out [Music] perfection oh sorry and threw the chair if they 're not met will they be found thank you thank you are there any further questions alright I 'll ask someone that we move to accept the report sorry madam mayor yes counselor rider I 'm just going back to the comment about the the neighbors not having a discussion at the consultation that hasn 't taken place so far so I 've just yeah can I just clarify the comment that you made about no consultation or can I just I just need to understand how we 've got to help with somebody addressing us with no consultation all right if this mentor would like to stand up [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] could I ask the [Applause] all right can I ask the proponent please if you could please give us a time line because there is a statutory requirement on the process of an MCU [Music] for our situation to think business they agreed to finance Republican nominee African universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have submission is logically connected in society some informal honest fight in wall I do counsel talks about tomatoes which talks buzz from so I just want to be sure that the property owners did receive their letters as well [Music] and our sadly Australia Post doesn 't deliver every day anymore it 's really chair it 's the next door neighbor I mean I appreciate that statutory requirements have been met but I suppose common courtesy potential dictates just from an engagement perspective and any desire to get a good outcome that you would engage face-to-face not a personal level with your neighbor and these aren 't things that we can change here but I want to say that it would post potentially help everyone in the situation to bring have a conversation Thank You councillor comment noted counsel Walker did you want to say something I just want to check that what registered mileages heard a comment registered mild so was it registered okay all right [Music] like oh thank you thank you all right are there any other questions can I remind counselors that this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and required concurrent agency to work with Council to develop the conditions on this I would like it that after the meeting that arrangements are made with the proponent the submitter and our council staff to explain exactly what those requirements will be under the development application and the operational works so everyone understands what is required I take I think we all should take into account the comments made by our engineer around the fact that this development may assist in alleviating some of the problems felt by land holders downstream and many of you will know that when these planning when these development applications come in quite often they can improve the situation for adjoining land holders because we actually have a line of sight of what is proposed and can set down relevant conditions to ensure that they can alleviate some of the problems or our counselors can I have someone move that we accept this report is there an appetite for that Thank You councillor Maliki no do I have a seconder councillor a by all right I will put that to the vote all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you all those against councillor I require you under the Act to give a statement of reason why you have you choose to vote against the officers recommendation counselor I understand your concerns but the you realize that under the Local Government Act if you choose to go against the decision the recommendation of staff that we require a statement of reason a valid statement of reason for that as per the Planning Act all right cancel my license is there I 'm happy to counsel Senate can make the replies council I think you 're yours your statement should be along the lines that you believe that the development application does not properly address the submitters concerns and that that is the reason why you have chosen not to support the recommendation of staff all right excuse me but met the conditions that you just mentioned before about the planning stuff could they be noted in the minutes as well please yes I 'll ask for the comments made by particularly by our engineer if they could be noted in the minutes of the meeting

through various state and federal government agencies to assist I would love to see as trial that to deal with our Flying Fox problem in this city great and I also think that we have the advantage of

the councillor mentioned above those sounds and obviously there 's been a number of factors for that missus a considerable increase we appreciate luck but the event itself is expanding Iranian official either they 've built me a microphone II which we sing some to make responded in terms of infrastructure setting up the market we 've also seen impact against on the community in terms of previous years a lot of the events and parts of the episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oximeter monsoonal event earlier in the year volunteer capacity has been stretched and Matsu people come towards the end with whistling sin affects lots of a community into it and so that in some of the roles that were originally taken or usually taken on by our volunteers which is the homo superior in the venue of the five days has that been moved to our professional security team which has seen a considerable increase in their costs the one we think is own equal to them that it 's necessity really philemon to go

times that we 've actually taken in residential property owners through the full process so I would just like to commend that report announcement thank you very much counselor Combe are there any

and 29 of the ordinary council agenda thank you very much do I have a seconder please councillor Maliki no thank you are there any other any further comments from the committee chair no any questions or comments from councillors around the report I thought the curbside waste and recycling audit was showed very interesting reading especially in terms of support from the community sorry alright councillors then I will ask you now to vote on this on the adoption of this report all those in favor against carried unanimously that ends the reports we 've dealt with item 25 so if you can move now to item 24 material changeable use five Mandalay Avenue if I could ask if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report which will change of user free shop which comprises of commercial art gallery and a gift shop the facility County currently operates in that fashion as well as I think ten square meters as the the dwellings used for a real estate office the reason for why we 've student an MCU application is because it doesn 't satisfy the the definition of a home business and so the applicant was required to lodge a planning application to justify the the existing use on site during the public notification process there are six submissions that received four in support at the proposal and two objections were received the reasons for objections was based on need for additional gallery given that there was one across the road and secondly based on a precedent that had actually set in in relation to a commercial activity in a low-density residential area the councils have assessed the application on its merits have they 've taken consideration their strategic framework of the planning seemed have taken consideration the low-density residential zone objectives and they as part of their assessment they 're recommending council approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the potential impact before that there is an if you actually look at what 's being proposed the scale what 's been proposed in terms of the shop it 's very similar in terms of scale of a home business so in accordance our planning scheme home business can be satisfied to a scale of up just 60 square meters the proposal that said this in front of council for a shop primarily for commercial art gallery in a gift shop is 460 square meters so it 's very comparable doesn 't set a precedent from a planning perspective each application needs to be assessed on its merits so counts councils have assessed the application given its location given that the impacts are quite minimal given that it 's located across the road from an existing commercial area and they 're recommending supporting the application subject to the conditions line in the report all right thank you for that are there any questions of counselors on this application I guess council green thank you thinking about it back if this would be directed to ever ever I love this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national operations that they change at all the square-meter egde of the use of the the commercial aspect being the art gallery and the the gift shop doesn 't change at all it 's just getting an approval a to satisfy a statutory obligation under the mining scheme thank you I have one other question um how long has this business been operating under under their current operation on Magnetic Island through the chair that has been operating for a few years at least three years from memory but it has been operating as other commercial uses prior to them my understanding so it 's just to satisfy the planning skin obligations in terms of the land use that it actually triggers thank you yes counselor Mandy I just heard the director say ten years of exposure so I just wanted fish to make relationship home-based enterprises or was it commercial it 's really chair home-based businesses per the definition with them planning scheme provides for a variety of users and they 're stipulated in the in the plan is here Michael I can bring it out the domain requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents that are run the octave that are operating the business the square meterage of the of the business and the potential impacts it may have on humanity in the neighbors it says through the offices assessment of the application it satisfies the low density residential requirements that the steam committee maybe this was a point that was clearly fresh there and that was the definition of a home-based business originally was the resident will the operator lived on site and with a small operation when this was our unfinished sermilik came forward they discussed that very nice for the years the thing is a home-based business but the option there was no residents the owner didn 't live on site they had employee work on site and that 's a bone of contention in relation to what the history had been home-based business turn now to an MCU who puts to us Nancy it 's a commercial zoning so it 's bring you some clarity around that is that fair assumption of what through the chance a couple of items just to clarify to satisfy the requirements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have to be the owner of the land that needs to reside on the site it 's just a resident within a dwelling needs to be operating the business in relation to the commercial trigger once you actually start providing a commercial use being a commercial art gallery and the gift shop that actually allows you to sell other products that aren 't necessarily provided on-site way that it 's not the artist that 's actually painted through the galleries and that they 're actually providing a shop use triggers another definition with the planning skin and that 's reason why they 've been required to provide sorry logic planning application thank you are there any other questions okay council okay thank you Mary just questions on in relation to I 've took that time I think in the area you talk about metal to box provided we 've got from what I can see that post yard everything this existing library any gift shop open every but a real estate as well is it parking provided Oh we had one person turn up to the real estate we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like we 've done I 'm guessing and there is though from what I can see is is no requirement for anyone to see lies acting on out of the Richmond Road I don 't have conscious of when you have excessive heart movements in and out on the shelf or the road the condition which will be left the West weeks later on that 's all there 's no requirement for them to seal but this is all I complain of the development less room for four hours correction yep it 's on page thirty thirteen to counselors car apartment in addition of your forger [Music] so if they found me I look across the road at the other commercial properties we 've got a I think it 's hard waste thought we 've got a takeaway shop a few other things I noticed there seen on there to the Vigilant with with concealed car plaques and so on considering this is B he proposed to become a commotion precinct would it help be pretty to condition that that 's all I 'm questioning its low density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed in terms of the goose Oh through the changes to clarify interest rate the acting directors comments we 're not changing the zoning all it is is facilitating and existing news so all we 're all the recommendations proposing to do is to approve the 60 square meters of art gallery and gift shop within the dwelling itself the residential zone remains underlying it 's doing its still designing thing true another issue I have but home-based businesses can 't operate over 60 squibs is that I think that 's correct isn 't so what is the trigger for if they 're already existing in 60 square meters they was the trigger for this reform as I guess is coming through that chair it 's the use purely because of the sale of the Art Gallery products and the gift shop at RIT it comes within the definition of a shop as opposed to a home-based business so if I can try and clarify this if you 're a hairdresser and your skill is obviously as a hairdresser petition you 're selling your services as a home-based service what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not selling their own pieces of art they 're selling other pieces of art and gifts and things like that so technically speaking while it might be only a very small business it doesn 't fit under the definition of a home-based business there 's nothing wrong if it is that yes correct but just want to clarify on the 60 square meters what the officer recommendations are proving at this point in time it 's just 60 square meters that dwelling if they want to expand even further they 're required to lodge another application for that expansion so it 's just reflecting what the current use is on-site we just want to clarify that that we 're not actually rezoning the land and that they can actually provide as much commercial square meterage on-site the approval is to restrict it to that 60 square metres of land which is comprised of 50 square metres of Art Gallery and 10 square metres of the office space can I just get a point of clarification please from the staff and it might help the councillors here if the owner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a use other than an art gallery and real estate agency was going in there correct and would and if it 's not a correct home-based business or fit into that category they 'd be required to come back for it with a new application for an MCU okay so we are seeing nods from the staff does that clarify that for some of the councillors yes ok council welcome I think that the confuse news we keep saying home-based business but obvious to them to you that 's it so it limps you on 60 square meters so it 's material chain views on a dual occupancy mm-hmm to a commercial MCU on 60 square meters so it 's not really a home base has now become a commercial zoning on 60 square metres it 's correct but I preferred councillors to the officers report yes it outlines its justification for how they 've arrived at their recommendation so it refers to the strategic intent of the planning scheme your arm but it also refers to the low density ozone and the performance outcomes and acceptable solutions as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme doesn 't necessarily like a better word prohibit a commercial use on within the residential area it still needs to meet the relevant performance criteria and that 's been outlined in the council offices report if you refer to the table for point three point one zone code part six it actually outlines all the relevant performance criteria objectives for the low-density residents low-density residential zone to satisfy the council offices as assertion that it 's not going to be a negative impact on the residential amenity of the area Thank You counselors if you start at page 40 and work through to page 42 you will see that under the low-density residential code that the director talks about the po9 for example which is possible outcome 9 that the development minimize impacts on surrounding land and provide for an appropriate level of amenity within the site having regard to noise hours of operation traffic visual impact odor and emissions lighting access to sunlight privacy and outlook it believes that this building and this operation can comply with that and it lists there how that how the proposal will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes through for various various things for example parking and servicing Council and possible outcome 15 parking facilities located to be concealed from public view to ensure an attractive streetscape the proposal will not affect the site 's existing on-site parking facilities which have never been concealed from public view it is therefore not reasonable to pursue significant changes to this situation in any case most of the driveway parking space does however remain behind the buildings so I understand ever would you like to comment further that 's really our point in relation to parking the point below that in terms of POS 17 refers to non residential users and the criteria that needs to be met to satisfy that requirement sabra toes to the character that refers to the scale of the development refers to potential impacts that ' systems been undertaken by by the officer and the officers satisfied themselves that the proposal has presented to council will satisfy those criteria so are there any further questions here 's cancelled yes through the chat so in essence what you 're saying about look at page 36 here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I perform on our six go away and plus the ones across right there eight six four so what you 're saying is the block five will stay as is the presidential but should not be rezoning or redesignated here to stay as is correct and one more question if I may we 're referring to refugees means on the youth mitigated that boy page 41 on the PIO 16 the developments refuse storage and collection arrangements will remain as existing so that prevents them from introducing any waste that being said front living in one of the big industrial means being wheeled out and he picked up I know it 's a small business but it is a no selling artifacts and things like that so that prevents any introduction of any large industrial bins being wheeled out once or twice a week is that correct doesn 't correct them and I refer counselors to the advice on item one refuse storage the applicants or developer must ensure their adequate an appropriate refuse storage and a collection register in place the service approved commercial users Thank You counselor greenie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting on Saturday to the island it was interesting to note that people commented that the tourism season this time this year was a cracker and I think businesses like this support the economic benefit of Magnetic Island and also supporting local artists thank you thank you our councils I 've just got a couple of questions now for the staff I note that you talked about possible outcomes 17 of non-residential uses are established only we 're obviously compatible supporting local day-to-day community not impacting on the role of functions of the city network and you note there in the last pair again the extent of the development confines within within the zone that 's right particularly for pier there was no compelling reason why the development ship should be located in a more appropriate area why do you need a compelling reason not to locate them not to locate them in a appropriate area I find that an interesting comment through the chair Athena 's referring to the to the center 's activation strategy know in relation to the hierarchy that we had in terms of major shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a small commercial enterprise so when do we maintain the centers of hierarchy particularly for shopping centers and commercial developments and where do we where do we draw the line that 's really where the professional staff feel the line should be drawn diligence really that 's really the chair there 's a couple of significant applications that have been recently referred to council and means that they are off along Ross River Road in those areas and that 's really is when you have a a major shopping said that that 's going to impact significantly on that hierarchy and council has dealt with that application previously and we have refused that application the rasmussen location all right counselors we 're being asked now whether or not to support this development application so firstly I need to I need someone who wishes to move and accept and second this report move councillor greenie do I have a second answer okay counselor Koon thank you for that I don 't believe we need any further discussion I think we 've dealt with this subscribe deal with this report do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know counsel greenie you 've spoken for this I could ask the second did you wish to speak on this as well what I would like to say is I have concerns I have been concerned in the reading of this that we are effectively a reverse engineering outcomes here and I do have concerns that people will start in a third Kaunas home-based businesses and push us into situations where pent-up creative precincts that actually aren 't in line with the strategic framework and he said that I have listened to everything the director said today so I didn 't actually attend this particular committee and so I 'm happy to speak in favour of a nursing home I 'm supporting the the options it 's recommendation my concerns are a lazy of me Thank You counselor do I have anyone who wishes to speak against this so I gather all right then we have a mover and seconder I will put that to the vote all those in favor against very well done because I know there were a lot of concerns on this and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Council if there is a significant change of use on-site that 's or our counselors that is the agenda proper we do have one item to consider in in confidential I 've moved counselor Walker seconded counsel Medina that we move into confidential to determine the final item which is part of the addendum item 26 i we have a move in second all those in favor carried unanimously is there any general business please counsel through the chair I 'm last Tuesday evening along with 200 other tiles of residents had the pleasure of attending and watching the first ever wheelchair rugby league international game to be played here in Townsville this took place at our very own Townsville Stadium as a fruit I also had the privilege of playing in the curtain-raiser to this international game a lot with some other local towns board entities now I played a lot of contact sports in my time from rugby league boxing and other support codes and I came away from this friendly game of wheelchair over length the bullet bruises then I think from any contact sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who saw the highlights of the international game from that night will attest to this and it 's not again for light-hearted but extremely entertaining good it would also be remiss of me not to mention the outstanding sportsmanship in place displayed by not only both teams on the night but also to all trainers coaches and supporting strong a truly wonderful evening on the night I was presented with a plaque by the management of the England team to pass one of the staff of the town 's losses Council Stadium to show their appreciation but to put some text around the significance of this gesture I read the following letter I received from Darren McKenna there was one of the coaches and trainers of this training will check NRL rugby league team and he has and still is working closely with the England team and was also instrumental in getting this game around the crust I 'm writing this d-mail to applaud the efforts of the TCC staff at the Town Hall Stadium in the lead-up Queensland Mullens working the travels on the day of the game did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead solutions with them and issues work result all tonight we had the pleasure of having a Plus referee mr. Tim Robinson there was head referee for the 2017 World Cup in France to out the see the proceedings as well as having the state 's affiliation manager Martin Meredith of the NRL as well as the management has managed the start of the English team at the game and the comments I personally got from them was now bearing in mind this is an email or a letter I obviously came down Makenna these are the words from Tim Robinson head referee 2017 world cup and friends this is one of the best facilities aren 't ever refereeing em from up Meredith Queensland affiliation manager of the NRL this is an awesome stadium we should bring the State of Origin here from English management of the Turing England international wheelchair rugby league team now bear in mind this team is through the world and at complaining wheelchair over land from quite quite some time and it 's made up of a lot of returned vets that have been involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best in the world better than any facility we are at home so and it 's again it 's cool down McKenna talking so all I can say is thank you to town for City Council for hosting our game and please pass on our congratulations to the team of the stadium they bent over backwards to help us make the night for success so in conclusion only men on behalf the England international with chair I believe management and team I present this plaque to manage any Hill in recognition of the expanding at the outstanding work that Paul has thought that towns was fighting did during the days leading up to on game day as well as after spray event the tireless effort their tireless effort have ensured the towns was well and truly on the radar for any future wheelchair sporting events at local state national and international levels thank you [Applause] counselors I think they should sit at the Townsville Stadium in recognition of the work done by our staff in ensuring that this was a great event for all who participated so CEO if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ensuring that this this event went very well it I 'd be very proud to say as host a state of origin will be the closest to the state of origin I think we 'll see for a while thinking that a myrin councillors councillor cook in particular the only reason I 'd like to make a statement is this is something we 're seeing repeated on a regular basis I bring to everyone 's attention the AFL masters that we 're an incredibly successful event that was held here and I was inundated with calls from friends who are much braver than I and they 're still playing at the Masters level who were unbelievably complimentary not only of our venues but of our staff and they 're all looking forward to coming back here again so I accept this latest confluent but I think it 's more important that we acknowledge that regularly our staff and our venues aren 't recognized for the quality that they provide for this community on a regular basis so thank you thank you thank you CEO all right thank you any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairman it 's a safe way probably in relation to this conversation because we have the sport and Rec team working up to working closely with clubs workshop happening this week so work today 's verse 27 I think we have a full house on that one so that 's an amazing outcome and that 's really helping clubs to be more inclusive in their practices and developing programs to support people of all abilities to participate in their chosen sports and then 30 kids we have the first little project going sports games again but a netball and a lot of bit bright people getting on that Court having experienced the wheelchair netball it snows I mean feet but that 's the third one and that 's actually being facilitated by clearing the TCC as a major player in that as well as the human rights conditions well done for inclusion Thank You counsel bright any further business general business yes counselor right on thanks Bannerman look I just would like update counsel and demeanor gone else accessible wait Altieri pop this last week so looking of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented our emotions to the port of that Star Conference they of course our conferences the way Lobby state government other bodies for needed changes to allowance it 's fun yeah council community 's needs and how most branded improving efficiencies pirated clarity on loss pertaining to disaster management and supported by our funding to Fort Benton vehicles I 'm very happy to report those three motions were successful with one being unanimous amongst the seventy delegates of over 70 councils and we of course support of the implementation of the changes that owes most mister thank you Thank You Council yes we had a successful ljq councillors just to to put it out there into public frame into the public area the motion that we put forward on the re on the on state emergency services has been enacted upon by the state government and are currently reviewing all state emergency services which it 's it 's had a lot of support from local government the sadly our one on dilapidated buildings we 've now had to move local or ourselves in terms of that the abandoned vehicle whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's many ways to skin a cat the one around abandoned vehicles because many of the vehicles we are seeing aren 't abandoned because they 're stolen government now or police now remove the plates on vehicles where persons are intoxicated or have other there are other issues around them having a driver 's license if they 're driving unlicensed or in it was something like that and the vehicle is kept at the side of the road so we have to be cautious of this pushing away of the state responsibilities back to local government so that 's what the LGA q and the conference allows us to do to tackle some of those issues all right arm is there any other council rider or council saw sorry council salsa Thank You Jay again on the LGA conference scented reference to who I have the he a lizard by the Minister of Local Government still in its way Pacific blade ransom updates member cara and he did a Bacchus at the meeting had some changes would be debated and they subsequently make past in stage parliament these include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments have been sought from the attorney general 's office around conflict of interest began greatly clarity and how conflicts are gonna fight and elf it now Adam was the register of interest which is intent to lock as much as practical thousand state members of balance but I would encourage all with a keen interest in the stage to reforms of Elko to get on the state government 's website rest conserve all kinds of information on purpose direction and expectations I believe it 's important to acknowledge his council North councils around Queensland that have loved the LG IQ to represent them to the state government but never at such a size makes her purpose behind balance throughout two degrees ripped into the future thank you Thank You counsel very good point raised all right any other general business counselor otter sister probably think the council for their support letting you go to the Volunteer State Conference in Brisbane and which is got somebody outcomes and learnings from that biggest one was probably that the update on spontaneous volunteers and besides doesn 't that was quite at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize people are so enthusiastic we want to help but unfortunately a lot of volunteers cleaned out cupboards and both means that actually meant a lot and they could have been cleaned up so about educating volunteers are going to disasters I took a lot from that and I 've been a 10-page that role through without we had a few the relationship we rebuilt with far north queensland that was you could never get that from a piece of paper or an eva so I think we have rare against another workbook to board with cans and yes we 're gonna work with captions but I think we can both learn of each other share our resources so that was really good the systems and technologies it was just great to hear what other people are doing all over Queensland the kind of trends and challenges and I noticed when council the food talked about when they asked about the grants and they noted the decrease in volunteering cities across the state actions it was it was a great conference for board members local councillors and people high up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on our grassroots volunteer conference which has been staged in Townsville in May June next year so I think there 's a conference for everyone this was certainly not for the grassroots and but we took a lot of learnings which I think we can probably in Townsville so Thank You council it 's for a living we attend men can Sarada councillor otter do you think eventually we 'll get a a framework that will ensure that during disasters we can manage volunteers in the most appropriate and best possible way I think we need to take some low pictures from other towns and other disasters I think we need to really just take what happened learn from it and fix it before the next disaster so I 've actually requested making wine thank you and volunteering points them because I think we need to be a bit more on the front foot alright that 's good there 's always learnings you can take away from these things Thank You councillor otter any other general business all right I will close the meeting at 55 and thank you all for your attendance","(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

infrastructure investment to build for our future while keeping our rate rise to a modest 2% across the board council will invest more than 429 million in delivering just our normal services to the

but we have delivered a modest a modest rise of only 2% for rates and utilities this year 's rate increase of 2% will be only 1 24 for the average householder each week this is equivalent to 55 cents on your general rate in 69 cents for combined water wastewater and rubbish per week we will retain the 10% general rates discount for early payments which has taken up by over 90 percent of Townsville ratepayers and equates to about fifteen point nine million in foregone revenue so we can put that money back in the pocket of ratepayers the unprecedented monsoonal event has affected or touched every person in this room it brought heartache and despair which is why council continues to support locals who were directly impacted by this event by further increasing the three-month extension for rates payments for the next two six monthly rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eligible homeowners able to receive an 85 percent rebate of up to eight hundred dollars off their rates bill annually our seniors make a big difference make a significant contribution to our community and as such we are thrilled to continue with our pensioner transport subsidy which equates to three hundred and thousand for the next financial year eligible pensioners can also benefit from our complimentary lawn mowing services which I 'm proud to say will continue to receive one hundred and twenty thousand dollars in funding in the next financial year pensioners who now are now also able to register to cats for free if they are desexed and microchipped this is an extension of our previous budget commitment allowing pensioners to register their first desex dog for free we appreciate our seniors so these concessions are about giving back to the generations who have worked so hard to contribute to the creation of the community in the city we see today as the largest city in northern Australia council is focused on building the infrastructure our city and suburbs need councillors 509 point 1 million infrastructure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major infrastructure and building program for our city and this spend includes 16 million dollars on waste landfills across our city 26 million on our water network including major upgrades to the douglas water treatment plant thirteen point seven million for drains and stormwater management including pump station tide gates and of course the underground network the southern suburbs rising main 21 4.5 million I hope will stop the backflow of sewage during major events the North Queensland stadiums precinct nineteen point six million dollars Belgian Gardens Cemetery 1.7 and of course the true book pool eleven point three million and the true book pool I would like to note is truly a precious historical asset the eleven point three million spent for this financially you will to this great local asset wonderful justice and ensure it is cherished and respected for generations to come we are investing 89 million in road and transport infrastructure which includes 8.7 million for footpaths and walkways around our city 1.5 million to seal roads in rural areas and I know councillor Maliki know and councilor rider you will appreciate how we will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road renewals across the city we are also well on the way on delivering water security for the people of Townsville with thirteen point nine a hundred and thirty nine point nine million to do to be invested in our three point water program this budget includes a hundred and seventeen point nine million in funding from the Queensland Government to be spent on completing the city 's new water pipeline as I 'm sure you are all aware this has been a major priority for our council and I am proud that we will deliver this project for the people of Townsville other water security projects such as the water smart package and reuse water scheme will also be delivered throughout through this budget the water reuse scheme will make it cheaper for water to be used on sporting fields such as the new Townsville Stadium public spaces as well as for industrial use these program the Townsville 2020 master plan provides a clear vision for our city and this budget is about delivering on that vision with almost 15 million to be spent delivering major projects I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct the River Way splash water park 3.6 million this will be built in the lower lagoon damaged by the recent floods the Mount Louisa opened space Central Park Castle Hill concept plan and Flinders Lane will also all receive funding this financial year these projects are community based projects from River Way and Kirwan to the Strand they will deliver world class experiences created by locals for locals and to be put on show for our visitors to enjoy Townsville 2020 is about setting up our city for the future that 's why we are investing in these projects now importantly public consultation has been a major part of the design of these projects and can I say we 've had a terrific response from the community regarding the mouth Luiza master plan and we have made commitments to those involved that we will listen and amend our projects prior to commencing works while we have allocated funding in this budget for Mount Louisa we will be going back to the community as we promised with the revised plans before we deliver this project we will make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed by delivering this very important and significant capital spend each year council plays an important role in the economic and jobs growth of this community by delivering the infrastructure and capital projects in this budget we are forecasting create the creation of 2831 direct and indirect jobs locally council is dedicated to delivering significant infrastructure and capital spending each year and plays an important role in supporting local jobs and small business growth and as I previously mentioned Absolut has allocated more than 1.2 billion to infrastructure and capital projects during this term of council this budget will benefit our whole city with funding allocations towards projects across the width of our region not just the sea council is committing more than thirteen point three million dollars to residents safeties and this includes a CCTV operation of 1.4 million community safety programs of a million dollars and communities response vehicles of and Stafford about 900,000 we are also investing in infrastructure which includes camera but replacements of 8.7 million councils all around this country are increasingly having to pick up more of the work that should be done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child neglect and a child abuse these are the real issues for our community and councils do not have the funds nor the police powers to deal with these matters so ladies and gentlemen this is a shout out to say the job the responsibility belongs to other levels of government and they need to step up but as a cadet council we also understand the importance of arts and culture to our community as well as introducing major events to our city which is why in this budget we are investing 15 million dollars on delivering major events and supporting arts and culture in our community we are delivering on our promises with the launch of the inaugural North Australian Festival of the Arts we 're continuing the successful towns will eat and of course Carols by Candlelight just to name a few Townsville is cementing our city 's reputation as an event an arts and cultural capital of northern Australia hosting these major events whether it 's Natha or the supercars brings people an economic stimulus into our city providing a boost to businesses and career jobs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 20 budget is one that I am extremely proud of and together with you councillors you and I will continue to work hard on job creation this budget is both practical and fiscally responsible this budget is a balancing act between rebuilding our community after the unprecedented monsoonal event keeping costs increase modest while delivering major infrastructure and building program for our city delivering 2,800 direct and indirect jobs are predicted to be created from Townsville City Council 's 409 point 1 million infrastructure and capital spend this year this is a budget that is building for our future we are still committed to our promises of maintaining long-term financial stability the budget focuses our long-term financial sustainability meaning that borrowings are being kept to a minimum while maintaining councils citywide commitment to the highest possible levels of service delivery fellow councillors as you are aware this budget is a the common culmination of a collaborative process between yourselves the senior management team and many of our key department officials can I say to all of you thank you very much it was a great process this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects that will fundamentally change Townsville for the better this budget is about delivering on the commitments to the community it sets us up for future prosperity by investing in infrastructure to create jobs now this is a budget for the future ladies and gentlemen I commend our budget to you now throw the floor open to counselors who wish to make comments for the budget Council Walker do you have any comments to me yes I do madam mayor thank you for the opportunity it 's great to see that we got 1.5 million dollars in rural roads and I hope you 've talked with the other two divisions have little roads but while you 're ahead nothing forgotten so we 'll get five hundred thousand dollars each in rural roads which is very exciting and that 's open above the toilet thousand that will go into reseeding bingo Park Road which is important we want more for the federal government like you said it needs to step up to the plate and help rural katar friends when it comes to agriculture and major industries in the rural sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating monsoon that we 're having our park upgrades after listening to the community in relation to the swing upgrade and in Fairfield waters and it 's on Lakeland Boulevard next to our one big spiderweb there and it 's a new ground finish to go in there as well that is critical and it 's very important to talk about it might not be millions and millions of dollars but it 's important basic infrastructure that our community expects and especially after monster an event when people are feeling a bit forgotten we haven 't forgotten them we 've done the bikeways for doing the linkages were doing the important little pieces that are the basics that people want get back on their feet when they 've been knocked down it 's not a handout it 's a hand up and we as a team have identified that right across the city and I want to thank the team for being united on that front it 's very very important that the people have not been forgotten especially those that are displaced this point in time so I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other thing just quickly madam me is those missing links on both ways that we 've identified around the city I had two critical ones that have very serious to public safety well I 'm Stuart drive across the road from Stuart pub from dom and tina streets recall that the kids have been walking on the highway and it 's been identified by the local community that need to be rectified and we 've identified that these are the little things are important but it 's fun to highlight those cover of items that aren 't very touched that we 've addressed and the bigger picture stuff as well to move the city forward not only just in the sporting sector but as a destination in an event capital of northern Australia so thank you to the team and you to map your leadership yes I just looked at people actually it 's just talk to the residents in the upper us about what they want in the area I 've been getting some good feedback from what we 've been delivering up in that area which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the councillors on that it 's a growing area as we know there 's a few big projects that are happening out there and in this budget you can see we 're investing in the future of the area so it 's great to see that we 're investing in those future building projects you know the rural road stuff that council Walker was talking about us is something that those that that look after the fringes of the town I something they have to deal with the guys in town don 't have to which is some something that we 're working on em we said we would in the last when we went to the election that we would have a rural roads program and we delivered on that so that 's going to continue on so I just like to think firstly more fellow councils CEO and all the rest of the staff for putting this budget together than in working hard on this congratulate any other comments this moment I just like Turia rate what you mentioned in your budget speech about the Tobruk pool I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book pool that has a amazing sense of history from the Olympic teams training here and I know that the the work that what we 're doing Twitter Brook pool will be as you said building for our future and it will be a very very well-loved and very well used asset so thank you and thank you to the staff herb delivering such a great budget and to the fellow councillors thank you yes canceled or at the end of the day it 's all about making a livable community and a great place for our community to live in so there 's initiatives around safety cultural development open spaces that 's all about creating the place that you want to live in so again I want to say very much thank you till the councilors who support the development of arts and culture within the community have gone out of their way to create outstanding outdoor spaces for the community and we stopped who have supported these big initiatives canceled or getting quite emotionally but thank you anyone else this councillor Jacob yes way to me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank my staff the director you see and the staff in looking at and giving me something that I can go back to my divisions my people some very good works have been included in the budget including bonnet road including the Annie 's Lane roundabout the federal black spot which is a very very important thing and even the priorities that have been given to my division in works for Queensland so I would again like to thank everybody who worked on this the councillors they worked on it and yourself to give me a great outcome not only for the city but for my division thank you your people must always remember that we 're here to service the whole community and especially in areas of safety it 's important to us that we that we manage that prioritize that and deal with that and I think that 's what we 've also done in this budget thank you any other discussion for cancers yes cancel every buddy who said about the investments and the spins that we are we are making out of this budget including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what do knowledge the state government for the works to Queensland program that we actually have put into this budget as well a lot of that is spent on the things that perhaps aren 't begins sexy you like the splash park but safety security footpaths and a lot of footpaths in my area and are they are going to be upgraded treaties but it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the savings that they made that allow this to happen we actually came in with large mandates as a lot of historical issues legacy issues we 've removed thirty eight million dollars worth of red tape those savings have allowed us to go on and actually invest back into the community I would like to acknowledge all of the councillors for their guts in being able to do that it wasn 't easy and we have achieved it so congratulations to everybody and thank you very much for the staff for all the work that they have done particularly in the finance department if you can pass that back onto them because they have gone above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO if you can pass that on to the rest of State Council Rhoda I just like to acknowledge it 's not a new investment but it 's a continued investment into the community events and all the non for profit community grants and because we had an overhaul this year I just want to commend the staff that the budget reflected the new grant scheme and the discount on community hauled I think the grass roots and the non-for-profits were certainly looked after very well and preciate that through everyone because everyone 's got them in their division so I think what you said before it 's the whole of the city I think benefit from this so and real roads of course thank you very much for her council it 's below that 's pretty I thought I was lucky last year but this year is like another gift so on top of the works for Queensland funding and now another five hundred thousand is just like a gift so thank you very much for supporting if they 're council you covered up on metal visa master plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the fact

@ @ @ @ @ @ that we don 't want in those spaces we have community safety women programs such as the Road Safety eat mental health from what ribbond oh and and the street-art activation with the fede

council we 've made two senior appointments to the executive team Danny Lynch has been appointed permanently as director of infrastructure and up operations and many of you will know Danny is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the organization originally I think in 2007 9 no that 's correct he worked in industry for a number of years before coming back to the organization about 2013 14 and many of us have dealt with Danny over a period of time and he 's practical ability has held him in good stead he 's come a long way from being a carpenter is that correct exactly and they actually I will use Danny as a poster boy for any young people as an apprentice who 's worked his way up into management and I 'm a I 'm a very firm believer that some of those skills and going back to study and further his education are very important not everyone knows what row they want in life and you take the opportunities where they are so congratulations Danny and the second appointment Stacy Coburn is taking over director of business services so congratulations Stacy Stacy comes to us from the mining sector and I have to say if you need a woman who knows how to deal with some of the union 's having worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stacy she has proven herself time and time again in terms of fairness in dealings with staff particularly the unions and is very well respected in regards of that so I 'm pleased to announce Stacy 's permanent appointment to our business services so congratulations CID wish to say anything about those appointments just as a beginning madam Eric skis the voice Danny and Stacy of heavens they rolled and I it 's a privilege to and I 'll keep using the term quickly cheer but it 's a privilege to have them my executor because we didn 't get the opportunity this morning I wanted to go on to make some comments which is why I asked a number of people that were here this morning for the budget adoption to attend this afternoon the effort of the finance team but more broadly the entire organization and when I talk to finance team of course I talk about both the the commercial and the fine angel inside the team upstairs that spent many hours working with the operations side of the organization to ensure that the content of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization whilst maintaining the fiscal responsibility that this organization has now managed to achieve in its fourth year running madam net to the councillors thank you for your support in that but I genuinely say that the budget has been and should always be a team effort it 's put together by an organization that understands what its businesses understands the imperatives of the organization and to use a few examples and and procurement is one that you spoke about earlier something that this organization should be proud of is that in fact it achieves 87% local procurement on every month and has done so for the last 36 months and it achieves that on a regular basis this correcta yeah and I think it 's an imperative of the organization to know and recognize that which is why I 'm acknowledgement within the governance and Finance Committee have an understanding when you come into real urgent works as we did after the flood event this budget has been extra special because of the additional quantum of work that needed to be done once the organization got back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been halted for a period of time managing the issues and a number of our staff as members of this community and councillors as members of this community had suffered through the event as well but giving us through that and giving on turning not only delivering that what we had committed to deliver but in putting together a budget that drives the organization forward and meeting all of its commitments has been a remarkable effort so congratulations councillors thank you for your support but in particular that congratulations to the team and my appreciation for the efforts and all of you thank you and thank you CEO I know that we 've often spoke privately about some of the stresses for particularly some of the staff over the last number of months and I was genuine in my comments and in the budget speech none of us in this room are untouched by the events that happened it 's been an interesting six months and I think it 'll be another interesting nine months after this it doesn 't break this mic system there Meramec correct our councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me there is a if I could ask that we delegate to the CEO funding Arrangements around NAIDOC funding for this year 's events there 's been a issue primarily also based around the flood event that 's caused some delays in in the ability to process their grant application so if I could ask your indulgence please I 'm going to move that we delegate funding for NAIDOC to the CEO for this year 's event only and I 'll move that seconded councillor Walker thank you I will put that to the vote all those in favor against carries unanimously Thank You counselors and with that and no further general business I will close the meeting at approximately 135 today thank you for your attendance","(-19.2589635,

but I hope I 've got that right there for the Townsville based crazy and community task force coordinator welcome welcome thank you take it away Thank You les thank you Mike and thanks the council for the invitation to present so as I mentioned I 'm from the invasive species Council the CEO Andrew Cox and the Townsville community task force coordinator for yellow crazy ants I want to talk to you about yellow crazy ants it 's actually a serious problem it 's one of the world 's worst invasive species and I just want to talk to you about how yellow crazy ants are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we what we how we should be addressing this this issue somewhere okay just probably for those who aren 't familiar yellow crazy ants I mentioned they 're highly invasive but they 're also very damaging they impact on the natural environment because one of the one of the problems about the yellow crazy ants is they form these highly cooperative nests the Nets the maybe they 've because the the nest cooperates so much they form a super colony so they can get to very high densities because there are high densities the ants pretty much feed heavily on all the surrounding areas and therefore the the native insects lizards birds get overwhelmed by the ants and very soon all you 're left with is largely just yellow crazy ants the forest becomes silent and so the heavy impact on native biodiversity the heavy impact on agriculture because the ants feed on a lot of the ellipse and I 'm stopped sucking insects and harvest them so we 're finding where yellow crazy ants already in the cans area they 're impacting on the sugarcane industry they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of of agriculture so there are serious loss loss to production infrastructure they 're attracted to electrical circuits and and so that 's a serious problem because they short the the circuitry they get inside people 's houses they can undermine tree roots because of these high densities and in fact for tourism it 's a serious problem not just the tourism just for people because this is a picture here of a pet dog which is being scalded by by the the ants that spray acid they don 't sting but they spray acid and that 's one of the things which is a concern they called crazy ants because I walk around sort of like an erratic move and so they they look like they 're crazy but because those form these these colonies and they get a very high densities that become a very major amenity issue for people in backyards the pets will be attacked your your your birds and your bird 's nests in the oh sorry the the nesting areas and and even your children will be overrun by these ants now these this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southeast Asia and they have only arrived in Queensland in about 30 different infestations they were originally treated by the Queensland Government and now we 've got just a small number of infestations but the state government withdrew its support in 2012 when they stopped all funding and what we were left with is a large infestation in Cannes three or four smaller ones in Townsville a large one in Brisbane and another one at Harvey Bay and now we just found another one at the the whitsundays so there 's not very many in Queensland and they 're also it 's Christmas Ireland and in Ireland but otherwise no other parts of Australia has these days so we 're going to chanced to actually read Australia of them if we can get them out of Queensland so I 'll just go through the four sites like I 'll just go through some of the impacts already of the the sites are in around Townsville area so this is an area just where the ants already found bit might just help me here with them so some of the risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commons so it can get finally not only into the town common but also potentially across to Magnetic Island there 's also a pallet construction business inside this infestation zone so it could be shipped to anywhere in Australia or including parts of Townsville in other regions so that 's quite a high risk and at this point there 's only there 's not we don 't even know the full extent of this infestation so there 's more work to be done in this particular area so I 'm one of the the stories that we have coming out of Nome is and you 'll be familiar with the local tourist attractions down there that that they first discovered that they had them because the tourists were complaining that they were getting burns as they 're coming out of the UM the first building that they came into down on the paths and things and across the road at the caravan park there were having Wallabies coming out of the bush with burns all over them so they um so that was quite a extensive amount of damage being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive stories but because the eradication program down there is into its third baiting as we speak so yeah there 's some quite a lot of good things happening down there but there 's a lot more work to do up here in some of the other zones and yes so they can form rafts as well so in the wet season micro walls they 'll just wash away but they won 't they 'll all stick together and follow the moving water so that 's really important that we actually locate how they move where have they moved to since the floods as well so okay so why am I here today is the invasive species Council we 're a particularly an environment group interested in the environmental impacts of invasive species we 're a national group we 're donor funded we 're not a council but we are a council in terms of an authority on invasive species that impact on Australia 's environment and what we want to do is try to protect Australia from invasive species and we do this by making sure we lower the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good biosecurity system to stop them arriving in the first place but when they hear that we we respond quickly and we want to contribute to those solutions we want to inform the community but we also want to actually help with the solution so we 've stepped up here and assisted the Townsville council to date with coordinating volunteers to help with the control program that 's so far our efforts so far been focused on the gnome area and this is a sort of outlines our team I guess we 're a national organization but at least working on the the Townsville project project we 've got two part-time people we 've got Bev here and we 've got admit the environment science community sustainability grants I think they are and we 've got another private donor together we 've got about 100,000 over about two years that funding runs out in September 2020 so we want to keep that funding going we don 't believe that the thought the the yellow crazy ant problem will be solved by that point and I 'll talk about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects rat funded the rest of our work is donor funded and I think this is there 's a lot of public interest in this in this problem we 're supported by the CSIRO James Cook University in the Wet Tropics miniature with authority because that 's where a lot of the expertise on controlling your like crazy ant lies and I should just make sure that the town hall councils acknowledged a leading the eradication efforts in this area we 're supporting them and we 're really grateful so far for the efforts over since you first found the ants and we want to keep working with you now one important concept I think around understanding where we are with this ant is the invasion curve this is a common tool to help understand the invasion process of a species that arrived in an area they establish and if you look at the bottom axes over time on the the left-hand axis the air infested infested over time the area spreads of course as it reached reaches the extent of their range the modeling shows the yellow crazy ants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas and the north of Australia so stretching all the way down from probably Lismore in even closer to Sydney all the way up through most of eastern Queensland across Northern Territory it is favorable for yellow crazy ants now what this this this diagram shows I guess is where we 're up to with the la crazy an invasion of Queensland we 're actually quite on close to the left hand side it 's arrived but still in the early stages and if you look at those the columns above the the curve they 're different responses to that by far the best approach is prevention if you stop it getting here in the first place all that investment will actually of avoid those damages and the estimates of the return of the order of for every dollar you invest in prevention you might save 100 but it 's probably more it 's it 's some estimates throughout a thousand dollars or even ten thousand dollars and obviously as you get over to the right-hand side as the invasion spread to the whole area those costs are yearly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-off cost stops long term long long long term costs and damage so with the alacrity and the Ferdie we 're still in the eradication phase because it is still technically feasible to eradicate the Electress yet with the current tools we have but the further you get to towards the containment strategy the eradication costs just start growing and to give you a feel of a guess of how much an eradication of an ant costs the red fire ant infestation in southeast Queensland around Brisbane they have 15 years into that they spent about 400 million dollars so far the area is about 400 thousand hectares it 's a very large area the infestation we 're talking about here in the Townsville there is probably between 100 and 150 hectares so it 's much smaller but for comparison 's also with the the Cannes infestation it covers about a thousand hectares and the Wet Tropics authority is spending about six million dollars a year on that and they 've got about another ten years to go so as it gets bigger it gets more complicated it gets harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the left-hand side in stopping it spreading the more success we get there will be a point where they were served the yellow crates krazee-eyez will cover so much area that we took the cost become insurmountable and you 'll just have to live with it and bear the costs every year which which can 't be ignored the the cost to agriculture human amenity into the environment so I 've just mentioned the cans the cans infestation is just some modelling done by Monash University to show what would happen if the eradication programme stopped and you can see that red area is where after a number of weeks about 20 years where the ants would would move to and and where the impacts would to manifest themselves at the moment I mentioned it 's only about a thousand hectares but very quickly because they move by but the the the colony is budding naturally but also because of human assistant movement those will inevitably spread and the impacts will spread and so they 've they 've confirmed that the acting earlier you get a cost-benefit ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts sixteen to one is the cost benefit of acting early and that 's a one-off cost for in perpetual damage savings now the foresight we have a Townsville we 're more familiar with the gnome society because the gnome area because that 's a residential area we 've been involved with in the council 's I think has focused most of its efforts but in the other three infestations are smaller but also have their own problems now the gnome area we have an eradication program in place it was developed with CSIRO support they were overseeing the baiting but the other three areas don 't have an eradication plan at the moment the moment we 're just doing the surveillance some suppression and I 'll show you some maps just in a second just to show you what it really looks like but they 're in different areas they 're currently affecting different aspects it 's already there 's lots of evidence or people who are already suffering you know in whether it 's the local resident in Nome whose people who are keeping the bird chicks finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or or even the the pest controller who 's struggling to work out how to control them because he controls the money 's land but there 's the neighbors aren 't doing anything about it so it 's pointless so that 's why a cooperative effort is really needed what does get Bev to talk about the individual areas in so must you be familiar with some of these maps but on the Douglas area we 've recently done some surveys down through the creeks into the river to check how far it 's gone and we have found quite a large patch running parallel to the Ring Road on the university side that we still we 're hang on that was suppression baited last year but that 's not an eradication plan so they are still there in quite reasonable numbers and could and and are actually inside the tunnel that runs between the university side of the Ring Road and the residential side of Douglas so there 's very high likelihood of them being able to move very easily into the residential zone and they have been inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm we 're still working on that but that it 's quite scary to think how close they are to the residential area as the new site on the university side of Douglas the suburb grows there it will become more of a problem over that side as well the mountain jeonse that we 've talked about already as being an industrial site includes the Queensland Rail Area and some of the commercial zones there and the Nome site as you can see includes White Creek so the likelihood we 've done we 've run some surveys further down the creek to see how far they 've got since the floods but then with the strong support from the Townsville City Council by security team they 've been doing a really solid job of the eradication there and we 've also Townsville City Council had the detector dog app to run through Elliott Springs as well so there 's some really good 0 is coming out of that that program which is really exciting having said that the biosecurity team is only they do all the biosecurity so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from feral pigs to feral horses and things so if something else takes precedent the yellow crazy yet misses out they do everything so there 's not a lot of time and to put in there but they put in what they can to do to keep up the program and this this is the black river site so you can see that there 's a very clear delineation around the edge of that so the blue is the zeros and the red is a yes we found yelling yelling so they actually spray their product that Lee before it leaves but there is not nothing stopping it from getting further out at the Black River Site at the moment so and it sauce it 's on two properties down there and the second one is a cattle property so there 's more work to be done down there as well so I believe we need to stop the yellow crazy ants spreading further to stop the increased damage the increased costs that will come the federal government and the state governments have decided they don 't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now has stepped up but are we going to really stop them what we need to do to remake sure they the ants don 't spread and we 're not left with something we 've got to keep keep keep working on for decades to come so they 're going to so the two key ways are stopping them are we we need to stop the movements the human sister moment and we need to control them so that so they 're addict ated we need to treat them so it 's critical when we in stopping new human assisted spread is to tackle I guess the sources of the spread now they we 've got to stop the Queen 's being moved accidentally most of its I 'm only aware of accidental moving so people aren 't doing it maliciously they 're doing it because they don 't know better because I don 't know that there 's a queen and a nest living in their pop plants they don 't know that the pile of leaves or branches that have been sitting on the lawn for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire there 's the sorry the crazy ants are moved into them so we need to be focusing on green waste illegal dumping because the green waste is you know where you least control that we know where it 's going but illegal dumping they 're going off into the parts of the bush and we might not find find it about it for until a year or so later and by then the colonies have started to spread it out from that movement of soil Marsh pop plants fruit and vegetable harvest so even even the cane farms farmers if they have them in their property there 's a big risk we need to get them on board so that they 're monitoring and they 're not assisting their spread so we 've certainly know with talking to the Wet Tropics already who have got a lot of experience working with cans Council that the the role that council has in managing the movement of these things is really important Plus also the biosecurity tools you have to make sure that there 's clear rules what can it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because if the risk here is that the the crazy aunts leapfrog to new areas and then you have another infestation it takes more resources it 's more costly and you have a new front and the cost go up we need to make sure there 's wide commute where you should take your your waste are following following the rules closely because the risk is too great community educational head over to bed risk quickly because she 's in charge of that so um you may I know I saw Margie at an event already this year so I 'm we 've been attending some events in the community getting more information out there we have a number of interactive activities and things so that people can build their awareness of what they do them don 't want in their backyard in regarding invasive species including yellow crazy nets and we can we show you them actual samples and the kids get up there being detectives and actually figuring out which sample is the yellow crazy out so they know what they look like and and making people aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flyer on the fridge at home and we 're just about to print some magnets as well so that they actually have a picture of what it looks like and what to do when they find them and then I 'll keep going with this one so this is an initiative that 's about to roll out in Nome when I first started in this role a few months ago having been volunteering on the project for a while I um I had a lady contact me and say can I take my green waste to the tip yet and I said let me get back to you on that so I followed through the process and the people at the waste services and the biosecurity team were very helpful but what we realized was that there was a in the armor because restrictions had been put on the Nome residents but they weren 't actually being checked at the the waste site as to where the green waste was coming from and should it have actually been arriving here so um we 've implemented a program so that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in Nome now we can actually support residents to start moving their green waste if we have done the field surveys on it and done the additional treatment so that it 's actually only being moved when we it 's it 's safe to do so okay so what do we need to do to eradicate all of the yellow crazy ants from the entire council City Council area well I guess first of all we need to make sure we know exactly the full extent of all of the areas and there 's no other areas in the way that you 're slowly building up the delimitation for most of the areas I think we 're fairly confident but it 's certainly after the floods state they do raft and I may have spread downstream so we need to be constantly checking downstream particularly we need to make sure the community is keeping their eyes out so delimitations a necessary first step so we understand a scalar problem we need an eradication plan I mentioned we 've we already have it in place for none but we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't understand well how big is this this challenge and how much money do we need and I don 't want to make sure you feel like you 're on your own here I think that we 've got lots we got some other sources of funding we might be at a tap into and I 'm happy to assist with that and whether it 's fill Anthropy state or federal government certainly one really inspiring aspect of the cans infestation was the community didn 't accept that no one was going to treat it and they lobbied and pushed politically and amongst the community to build support for that funding eventually the funding didn 't come but they needed a plan to rally around to work out how much was needed now I guess because you don 't have the funding you need at the moment you really going to have to prioritize you better I think effectively probably stage your eradication but in the meantime the areas that aren 't being treated you 've got to make sure that that risk is not being exacerbated so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the quarry site make sure that that 's not being creating new problems so then it 's going to need to be a containment strategy which should be less costly to support while you 're waiting to get the funds for the full eradication from those areas over all of these this whole program you need a communication strategy so the community 's understanding what the problem is they 're helping with your eyes looking for the crazy ants and that the movement restrictions on those areas where there are hella crazy ants people are not accidentally spreading spreading the ants so really this is the challenge before you I think until now I think there 's been low awareness about the problem but it 's except I think Noah might think there is fairly high awareness but outside of that then when it isn 't great and I think a lot of the the response has been a bit of catch-up you 've got a problem you 're trying to deal with it as you get the pressure to act on it the better way to approach is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of every last ant and then develop the funding and the program supported by a good science to get to that point where you 've got no ants because if you don 't have a plan and you just keep on I guess putting out your baits and hoping the numbers go down and then there will be no complaints and there might be a few ants given away but no one 's going to find them for a while you just keep beekeeping doing that for the next you know decades to come and the problem will just be a perpetual problem if you can I think because the the size of the infestation is so small in most of these areas in these areas you have the real possibility to eradicate these ants and the Wet Tropics management or ti are willing to lend their expertise and they 've shown that you can you can eradicate yellow crazy ants from relatively large areas 100 hectares or more and they 're slowly the areas that they 're infested in there are now coming down quite drastically I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions and any any more information I think you 're not there go ahead so Southeast Asia and often with invasive species in their areas where they native to they may not cause a problem because they have their natural predators and parasites and things so the numbers may not be as abundant and they got here they came in largely through timber imports is what we believed they most of the sites were around place timbermills around Queensland and they came accidentally on those timber products that were from areas where they had yellow crazy answer yes controls okay so fiddly if they control the border the arrivals of the cargo and passengers it purports possible to leave the ports of state responsibility makers so it 's managed by department agriculture they manage they polish obviously caught this quarantine and now they 're used to all-encompassing word by security it 's federal but there 's a property relation is part of the possibility right readers need to government agreement but responsibility they 've got protocols about when they trigger a response for a new infestation now for the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Ireland the Queensland the Queensland infestations did not trigger that because they they were already existing infestations that emit early Christmas Islands it was a contained area and Arnhem Land one was isolated I mean we believe that 's a bit of a flaw in the process I really should have triggered that and when that 's triggered it 's a cooperative funding model based on where it could spread to and the states and the federal government collectively fund it Oh everybody well I guess there are two points with the fire I guess one of the federal roads through the borders it didn 't trigger the National responses but the state level they were funding the eradication of all of them and then because of budget cuts in 2012 they stopped Paulette eradication and directed the funds elsewhere funding cut was one thing but they shifted the legislation and made it a local authority responsibility and they don 't have any basically and that new legislation is that correct under the biosecurity act of Queensland and local governments responsible for matters which aren 't subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift in the back in 2012 to us any other questions one of the approach and we 've had some great success it 's not over yet but it 's a bit of a journey like you say and I think the community 's been very good working with us and portly we found out late in the piece when we started our process but the outcomes looking pretty favorable but thank you for your efforts and we 'll be working closely with you into the future thanks capsules we 'll have to keep working with you thank you thank you okay chief executive at the the next one is a double recovery recovery updates from the natural environment this is a third of our recovery committee updates great Bruce thanks thank you it 's the chair counselors and CEO and directness so I 'm presenting today on the natural environment disaster recovery my name 's Greg Bruce I 'm general manager of environmental services and counsel and the coordinator for the disaster recovery of natural environment so obviously we all know what we 're talking about North Queensland monsoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross River and the whole catchments of North Queensland and we were tasked with in terms of responsive assessing damage and impact to the natural environment for the coast rivers and creeks across the whole of Townsville from paluma to Woodstock and caustic angola the coordination of the natural environment group runs across multi agencies across all of Council multi section and divisions and involves assessing monitoring coordinating rehabilitation developing strategies and mitigation looking environmental amelioration options and advising on sustainability to Council and in a number of other things including permits and licenses and not not forgetting wildlife so the natural resource management an impact that we 've been working on mainly as the natural riverbank erosion River course changes vegetation loss in those areas and the riverbanks of waterways and and flow paths restoration thinking about how 's this flood which we haven 't had since the 1940s impact on our city and how we can cater for that into the long term future as well as taking into account short term responses and another one that 's sadly long often forgotten as aquifer restoration and recovery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own environments so we 're working to build in a response to that building on our previous work and then their stress management and beach erosion so this unfolds into the plan on a page and we have our recovery objectives and we move through those recovery objectives and and then we 've developed strategies for recovery so we 've completed the first stage of an impact assessment we 've got more impact assessment to do there 's the whole of town saw in its catchment is a massive area and the flood and its impacts across our catchments was massive and it 's it 's often hidden amongst the vegetation that arose as a result of the floods as well so and we completed our Emergency Response and then I know I 'll show you a picture of that in a minute in terms of recovery strategies we 've again this flows on and and and this is taken out of the plan on the page but really where we 're looking at long-term ecological restoration which includes the impact of yellow crazy ants and what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've controlled them at Woodstock before the flood and resilience and the adaption activities that we need to undertake into the future and looking at our resilience planning for sustainability and then River recovery coastal catchments and then these are the the fundable programs that we put together and we submitted them to the state government for Queensland disaster relief funding arrangements and it 's included in category D the the three at the top and then category see there 's looking at tourism and ecotourism opportunities and a lot of it we 're having to do outside of any funding arrangements and work into business as usual as a council in a community and we have submitted for an amplified sustainability program which on our business as usual funding this year and we have developed that or everything I 've just talked about into a plan of a one to two year recovery and we 're I 'm going to go through some examples now of coastal Esplanade and and Beach assessment recovery Rose Bay was heavily impacted by the flood and a significant erosion occurred from the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and we 've done the first part working with civil works in cómo and and fleet and developed the initial response from our business as usual funding that we had available but importantly we were able to leverage and maximize that outcome by obtaining sand from the port and we ended up incorporating the same from the port in our funding application unfortunately at this stage we weren 't successful in that component of being able to leverage however there is other good news associated with it so we 've done the first step it 's it 's only the first step it 's a very basic recovery of the beach but at least we have resilience for the next cyclone season the other important one to demonstrate today is Nellie Bay recovery and restoration been an ongoing erosion issue as a result of the harbor in the harbor wall in the beach our roading into the harbor and this was all been reported in the media and very popular on magnetic island as councillor greenie would know and but the there was significant erosion and we needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have only just recently got the final approvals to build the the groin there that groin is really important in relationship to being able to progress this project and to be able to but commence really restoration works at Nellie Bay so whoops sorry so that that 's a I 'm map showing the the integrative solution we have because as many people will know that Creek no longer goes onto the beach despite best efforts of many to keep it that way it now flows into the harbor so but we 've been very clever in working out that we can move the sand and we move the sedimentation process upstream of tuning street and we created many sediment basins to remove either low volumes are saying coming through or if there 's slips up in the hills and very big wet seasons big volumes are saying can move through and we as a local government are required to take that sand and put it on the beach so we have been very busy with CMO and their Civil Works team they 've done an outstanding job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach and and and done it with professionalism and safety so this is them working on the beach at Nellie Bay and I would like to commend CMO publicly for the work they did there they have been exemplary and safety and working with the community when they 've come down and asked what 's happened happening of the the the size of the sandbags that are there are very quite small and they 're really not a big impact next to the rock groin they will make a cigarette we believe that 's going to now channelize the creek out there and and we we 've also got some machinery to be able to go on into there and do work to be able to continue to keep the sand out at a lower reduced cost overall but also we now have are going to be able to put sand in big volumes from the Ross River and ice from the Gustov Creek and that 's this is a really great outcome for our city it looks a small that all thing but it for me it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy and then on to River and coastal works that were where we 're still not fully funded for but the river catchment things were working on a delay what we can do environmentally to hold water back in the hills through fire management and other things how we can cost that looking at flow paths what happens in recreation spaces that got flooded how we can build in what a sense of urban design that our Creek de coral team has been working on for a long time and looking at groundwater and filtration and how we can enhance groundwater and filtration and to same indem drain Mendham swales and other swales around the city where there 's actually a very important groundwater interface and looking at surface water capture in key locations you either deal with velocity or storage or both preferably an inflow management and and you know there 's the challenge of we 've we 've said a lot of land aside on the south bank of the Ross River and building community capacity so we are learning from that the floods in Brisbane and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and and it 's informing into what we 're doing and it it 's a very important that we restore wetlands and slow and store the dam has a massive mitigating effect as we all know and has been validated by the IOM report and and there 's things we can do in the dam catchment in in terms of increasing the sponge ability of or ability for the dam to delay peak flows and then same down into the catchments we have all everything I 've just talked about is it 's built into a program that we 're starting to to really articulate and develop and then we 'll be working across Council in our community in the next two years and it keys around the reduction of the the the flood hydrograph and this is results from Southern Queensland where they planted trees and look at the way they manage catchments and in example catchments they 're able to change the flood hydrograph and that 's a key aspect in mitigating for the community so just quickly trees play have been now understood to play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soils and and grasses in waterways and wetlands having a cultural shift in Townsville perhaps that you know long grass in drains with Mobile 's is an appropriate thing if we want to get the water infiltrating into the to the ground and mowing our boundaries and keeping our boundaries good and and we 've also been putting together we have worked on geological maps and we 'll understand I think that Townsville was in the geology zone of a floodplain the whole of town saw except Castle Hill and Mount Louisa and so we we have to address these ideas and we 've gone back and reconstructed the maps which would churchly start to fit together some of the flow paths that people have thought while way that flow that way and this it 's not that this is proof or anything it just helps our understanding and our ability to work with planners and to plan into the future and then we 're getting into funding applications and we 've we 've there 's 33 million available we are sharing it for environmental works and coastal works and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided up and so the surgeon works reconnaissance and long term works and that we are facing some challenges with how things are viewed in different areas but where there 's good news in terms of with negotiating funding outcomes they 're not been announced yet but we are moving down the path and we 're looking at sort of funding allocations that we that are significant for the city but we 've got a lot more than this to go because we and I 'll just quickly finish up by going through from the top of the Ross River down the catchment the types of erosion we 're looking at and these these areas will be subject to more detailed analysis in the reconnaissance phase which we believe we 're about to get funded for at a reduced amount to what we expected or need however these areas of erosion we 've actually through and a long way to go the other significant one is being able to what though they didn 't let us take the same from the port which comes from the Ross River in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at that strategically and but we have got it from the Ross River and if I 'm just finished with 19 seconds of blue water so that councillor Maggie is knows we haven 't forgotten that so this this is some drone footage showing blue water and the types of flood damage that are down there and and you know it 's it 's really about transformation of the river you can see a lot of trees down and and how do we manage this environment and there 's probably not enough funding in the world to get solutions out there it 's a giant floodplain so we have to start rethinking the way we 're doing things and so we believe we 're building the expert story for landscape scale environmental restoration much like the yellow crazy ants it 's going to be bit by bit we 'll get the key parts and we 're also building in sustainability climate change adaptation and advice and and we we 've been activating our environmental products and services thank you thank you any questions good thanks great thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the planning services update Paul Johnston thanks Paul my presentations focusing on from the report I 've presented at the September Planning and Development Committee meeting which related to a planning services update so this presentation is all about how we 're setting the planning framework to facilitate economic development within the city from a town planning perspective so I 'm just gonna focus on today update on our city plan performance in terms of the planning scheme that regulates development in the city how we as a section facilitating development through development applications and timeframes and also initiatives to encourage development in the city so the city plans being enforced around five years now it was focused on evidence-based planning in terms we did a lot of studies to inform it at the time and also an easy planning scheme to use and navigate for the community and the industry I look to strike a balance between encouraging development and also protecting the things that we love about this city and at the time was really about getting low risk applications out of the planning system so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community and we don 't need to see and read and regulate and increase red tape we also looked at protecting character houses within the city and also more regulation of advertising devices from our previous planning schemes and we kept this document up to date and so far done 16 planning scheme amendments to the to the document this slide here tells the story of the new planning scheme and how it is really facilitating development so what it shows that of all the applications that have coming that 's compared the assessment under the old scheme versus the new planning scheme and what it 's saying is that close to 50% of applications have a decrease in levels of assessment so what 's that saying if it used to have to go through public notification and there has to go through code assessment or it went through code assessment it has to go through a self-assessment which means the decreased level of timeframes to get an approval which means more certainty for the community and the developer so it 's a really great outcome and it shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out faster so some good news stories around that and the I 've just highlighted some of these we won 't talk about that 50 percent what does that really mean that that seems like 140 duplex applications were approved through the certification rather than going through a lengthy planning approval process or warehouse applications that are just for storage purposes they can just get an approval through a certifier and they still do the TIC office and the planning scheme but they get a quicker approval through that process so and you can start see the savings that come about from those aspects when you just make those policy changes within the scheme and things like reusing buildings and I provide some of the examples shortly around when some business closes or changes and you can reuse it for something else quite quickly without having going through a lengthy approval all where you need to establish a new dwelling or small-scale home businesses and rallies departments that we 've all reduced that level of assessment around those so all up just with those examples that are provided to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy two weeks and assessment timeframes and over half a million dollars in fees and that 's really important during these economic times that we 're pulling those levers for development and here 's some examples around what I 'm talking about these things go unnoticed but when you go into a little bit more detail you start to see for example charters tezur0 no bank and I 'll closes up and then we see an outcome associated with a coffee shop and a drive-through and when if anyone 's ever run a small or medium sized business in terms of doing these fit outs from getting the approvals you 're at your lowest cash flow and you need to make sure you know it 's a high risk for a business like this this business was able to go from to purchase the site go from a bank to a cafe without any lengthy approvals from council is actually just the fit out of the bill and are able to move in so their risk was quite low it was really about the cash flow to able to refit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to take from counsel or whether I was going to get submissions and a highly successful business if you drive parser you see it 's you know so going quite well good coffee yesterday the and they 're things like you know things change and you know hardware stores have changed with the different models that are provided so you know long term you know might attend closed down on charters towers Road now that building could have sat vacant for a little while in terms of a changeover but with the changes in the planning scheme Jim was able to move in fit it out again previously that would have been lengthy three or four months approval that would seldom go in there get a fit out of that premises and then established a Jim again gave them certainly in terms of going to the banks and getting the relevant loans and those sort of things actually establish their business in the last example this is out at a during our central the Willows sort of changed hands with the hardware store and they converted to a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go through that but you can see sort of how these these important levers and changes that we did with the planning scheme allows these reuse of these buildings quite quickly so it was an extremely important shift for us one in 2014 that we didn 't particularly you know her on that horizon that will have going to have those tough economic times but we 're seeing some improvements in the market but certainly important time to have that planning scheme in place and we really receive great feedback from the development wreath at this planning scheme is one of the best in Queensland in terms of our fees the EDI a so this is the Urban Development Street of Australia made up of developers and Industry reps and consultants so they 'll tell you if your fees are expensive for they 'll tell you they won 't hesitate to tell you if you 're expensive what they 've told us when they did a review of a sample of the fees that whether it have the equal lowest fees with glads and in Queensland from similar sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective of lodging and applications so this was not us during the sample this was a independent body and I found Townsel and Gladstone in first and in terms of cheapest than cans Bundaberg Fraser Coast Makai Rock Canton and then for the bigger councils were also cheaper than to Humble Redlands Ipswich Logan Moreton Bay Brisbane Sunshine Coast Gold Coast so of all those councils are where equal cheapest in fees that 's for the lodging of DA fees as a when you 're launching a development application in terms of our assessment timeframes I 've just highlighted there what the statutory requirements are from the state government and how we 're performing as a department in terms of getting approvals out and as you can see we 're performing quite well and issuing approvals well below the statutory time frames for DA applications from ranging from operational works to you know lodging a car port application for a citing require relaxation to commercial premises or residential development so you can sort of see from the the stats here I won 't read them out that we 're under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our applications are processed within the time frames and also all those 10% that we don 't process when those five frames then normally because we 're in the go skating with a developer about conditions of approval or we 're working about getting a good outcome for the community because we are you know we are there to protect the community from inappropriate development as well so it 's important to have those discussions there are other initiatives that we 're looking at as well in partnership with our future cities area we 're working on a CBD development centres package which will be considered in the near future and also we have a plan write approval process which means you can get an approval within five days for low-risk applications they have to go through our system and finally I 'll just going to touch on our infrastructure charges so we did a review of our charges so this is what we charged developers for major road upgrades or drainage water or sewage networks across the city when they develop based on actual figures about in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewage it uses we 've seen a reduction in infrastructure charges from 5% to 33% 469 new development so that 's basically saying that when you 're carrying out a development is going to be more feasible this year than was last year in terms of you fees so just to give you and certainly that was supported from the urban developer the UDI a as well and they publicly stated you know that they were quite pleased of that have occurred I won 't run through these figures actually just shows when you you know the sort of things that you might be developing and the percentage of savings in terms of those percentage figures yeah they can range from three and a half 3,700 and savings for a dwelling on four hundred square meters when you 're subdividing a block of land to four and a four four thousand four hundred dollars per one-bedroom room for a retirement village you can see that 's making it easier to do development within the city and that just shows lastly just some graphs around the cost of developing say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure charges are so compared to those six councils were quite competitive in terms of number three in terms of those charges again for four hundred and 499 square meters blocks sort of ranked three third in terms of those six councils in terms of our fees and the last one is multiple dwellings where the cheapest to develop multiple dwellings within we 've compared to those six councils so that 's a really brief snapshot in terms of some of the work that the planning services area is doing I think it outlines some of the facts and the true figures around how we 're performing how expensive we are and in terms of them I think there 's a misconception that we are we 're not we 're not expensive or we 're actually one of the quite of the cheapest councils in terms of the assessments so I think that that comment of expensive is is certainly not justified and it shows how hard the team 's been working in that space in terms of getting development out so thank you for the opportunity percent today I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation is Inga Davis the program director for the water security package thank you thank you thank you Thank You deputy mayor it 's hard to believe this is actually my sixth presentation to Council on the three point water security solution so today I 'm really going to take the opportunity to look back at what the past year has been and also where we 're heading next so it feels like a long time for me that the terms of water security task force handed down their internment and final reports the first interim report was way back in the 30th of June 2017 which led to the creation of the three point water security solution as we are all familiar now of the recommendations put forward by the task force 3 were considered essential to get Townsville to a secure water environment as quick as possible two of these projects were aimed at the supply side through the creation of the Horton pipeline duplication and also to provide an alternative water source through the creation the recycled water reuse scheme to protect social infrastructure from drought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart package to provide water wise rebates as well as supported by community education and awareness campaign so first time in our update on the Horton it 's a little bit hard to see on that slide but obviously the significant wet weather event did impact the progress of works resulting in the project completion date being extended from December 2019 to March 2020 but the project team has done an incredible job trying to get make up as much as that lost time as possible a hundred percent of the vegetation clearing and the access tracks have been completed by many constructions as part of their Civil Works package on stage one delivery of the GRP pipes is nearing completion with all six shipments delivered to Townsville 2820 pipes or about 33 kilometres of the pipes have been delivered to site the bends are being manufactured in Townsville at the RPC factory in Bali and all bands and pipeline deliveries will be completed by the end of September 2019 to site DJ mcCormick who were appointed to do micro tunneling and pipe jacking under the Flinders Highway and mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed vacuum testing and grouting some minor repair work is outstanding Mendy have also achieved practical construction of the tunnel bonnet tunnel boring and Civil Works importantly the pipeline installation packages there were four of them being done by BMD civil plus and NQ excavations are progressing well as at the 19th of September we had sixteen point zero to six kilometers of pipe installed in the ground and excitingly we anticipate reaching the 50 percent mark by the end of the month later this week or early next week more than 900 people and a hundred and fifty businesses have directly or indirectly worked on this project breaking up the packages into work so that local businesses could benefit was always a goal of the project team so it 's great to see these numbers in terms of next steps for the hotend pipeline the under bore contractor will be able to enter the dam and finalize the repairs to the Avella per alignment to achieve practical completion the pipeline installation packages will continue with the remaining pipe to be in the ground by early 2020 all principally supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical completion of the civil works packages by Mendy will be able to be taped undertaken following completion of their works and as we have now received confirmation of funding from the federal government for stage 2 of the pipeline the project team are currently finalizing the revised upstream limit of works for a suitable connection to stage 2 negotiations are progressing with the federal and state government in relation to the stage 2 project and council is hopeful some preliminary work for stage 2 can commence early in the new year the stage 1 pipeline installation packages will be in isolated tested and commissioned by March 20 20 X tis our recycled water reuse scheme this scheme will deliver high quality recycled water to a range of irrigation and customers by taking treated effluent from the Cleveland Bay purification plant and passing it through an advanced treatment process to achieve a plus standards the scheme will produce 15 mega litres a day of recycled water with the majority of the pipe work to be in the ground by early 2020 the diagram up here shows the 24 kilometres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be installed the different colors reflect the different packages of work that are being delivered once again we sought to break the packages into smaller sizes so that local firms could take advantage so far on the recycled water scheme or design works for all the main laying packages have been complete and as part of that design work or relevant approvals have been submitted and received by state departments following on from the parallel negotiation process approved by council Council approved clean tech as the preferred supplier to build own operate and transfer the recycled water facility at the Cleveland Bay purification plant over a 25-year term council also endorsed a recycled water policy which sets out council 's objectives and responsibilities for the scheme the first section of construction work awarded which ran from the back of the Murray sporting complex through Annandale in a joint arrangement with the southern suburbs rising mean the construction of that is 95 percent complete this was run by an RMS GM joint venture and accounts for 4.2 kilometers of the southern suburbs and 4.8 kilometers of the pipe for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renegotiation of our Cleveland Bay discharge license council officers have been working with AECOM to undertake a detailed to undertake detailed modeling and an ecotoxicity risk assessment to determine the impact of discharging the concentrated effluent to Cleveland Bay these reports are now complete and further demonstrate how council will manage the ongoing safe discharge of brine to the bay this work will perform part of council submission to the Department of Environment and science for the license amendment council officers have also developed a pricing structure for the Industrial and irrigation water that has been approved by council we have also developed a customer agreement which we are now using to secure the participation and commitment of our customers in terms of next steps for recycled water we plan to award the contracts for separable portions one and two which will connect the recycled water to other stages of the network both of those will be shared trenching with us there southern suburbs rising mean we will then we will also be commencing the installation of the leg of Maine that will serve the new stadium and the reed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murray complex will also be separating the irrigation infrastructure from the potable water structure on some of the larger water murray sporting field tenants will also be obtaining pricing for acceptable portion sticks which will run to the industrial will run the industrial line out to the state development area and some metals fire we will also be seeking to finalize the technical specifications around the treatment plant with clean tech and get final approval for the contract to enable construction to commence in early 2020 following on from our successful meeting with DES we will be looking to submit our formal application to DES to last is the water smart package I 'll go into detail about the amazing results of the package soon but first I 'd like to go into a bit more detail around one aspect of it which is the appointment of the supplier to deliver an integrated marketing communications and community education and awareness campaign to educate the community in this once in generation water security programs that we 're delivering the community education and awareness campaign was one of the key deliverables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community with rebates is great it 's only part of the picture achieved achieving a change in behavior requires more than simply giving someone a water saving device you also need to invest in informing informing the community of modern water wise practices so we can work with the community to adopt and more importantly change behaviors that are appropriate to Townsville and it 's dry tropic environment its intent is similar to other campaigns targeting wise water use that have been run by other councils in Queensland let 's not forget that on average in Townsville we use four times more water per person than other counterparts in other cities accordingly we were when we were developing the water smart program we always set aside part of the funding to address this issue that included funding to build a web portal to engage a specialist firm to develop and deliver the campaign including doing market research testing talent acquisition budget to spend on advertising to inform the community and also to produce marketing collateral such as tap such as shower timers water bottles and also games for kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like in May 2018 council invited tenders from firms to to deliver this package 11 responses were received as part of the tender which included three local suppliers and one supplier with a local presence the tender involved a three-stage evaluation process to ensure council was going to get a firm that represented value for money and like all other tenders were assessed by Council whether they were a local supplier and had capability to do the job amongst other things this whole process was assessed by an independent probity adviser we found that the tender assessment panel carried out its functions in accordance with the request for tender documents that were issued what was pleasing was that AC were awarded the contract they are a local firm and had the best capability and knowledge to deliver this and also were the best value for money AEC were initially appointed on a schedule of rates contract up to 240 1100 on the 4th of September 2018 as with other tenders submitted in the tender process the original tender by AEC provided additional scope and costs which included sourcing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was uncertain at the point of engaging in agent counsel felt it was not best to purchase those services until the campaign was more clearly developed to ensure no money was wasted throughout development of the campaign it became clear that extensive market research was needed both qualitative and quantitative to assess community attitudes to water and also to inform the campaign and to test the proposed brand given the short timeframes involved from when the campaign was finalized to when the campaign was launched on the 16th of July it was clear that AAC were also best placed to source marketing materials with their suppliers it was these aspects that led to an increase in the AAC contract all of these elements were in the original scope of the tender they submitted in addition it was also decided in the development of an ordinary campaign you would engage a specialist firm that specialist firm would then engage talent for the campaign as they are the ones who are organizing shoot schedules and logistics with the talent given counsel already had a majority engaged for the campaign it also made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could actively manage time logistics and shooting schedules I would like to be clear that in transferring Jamie 's contract there was no increase in value to the amount Jamie Durie will receive I would like to now focus on some of the great work that ACC has done in delivering the campaign to date the campaign from July right through until October will continue to focus on the rollout of the water smart package as you will see in a minute the take-up has been phenomenal we have actually been able to reduce our advertising spend because the water smart package since its launched has been running off word-of-mouth which is fantastic as part of the AC work done today they have completed the following detailed market and social research component for the campaign and education awareness an economic impact study looking at the pipeline delivery the water smart package icon brand development and key messaging multiple press advertisements magazine advertisements digital advertisements in towns of shopping centers digital advertisement for the Cowboys Home gain we they 've done digital billboards some of which you can see up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio promotion multiple video shoots with Damien II and the water smart package suppliers and also the water smart team including scripting and project direction they 've done digital social media advertising promotional and informative content for the web portal they 've done promotional material merchandise FAQ sheets promotional and event displays and promotional photography this has been supported by infor in the first four weeks of the water smart Council undertook a detailed targeted stakeholder engagement campaign from the 16th of July to the 11th of August the team had direct contact with eleven hundred and twenty six people at forty two events and locations that included being present at Australia post offices sporting events markets local shopping centers and a retirement village just to name a few all of our library and customer service staff were trained in order to help people register for the package so as the water smart package nears completion the next phase of the campaign will work focus on working with the community to become a water smart city there will be multiple components to this which will include educational and fun videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TCC and industry experts on key water saving tips this will be designed to encourage awareness of water usage this will include some of the footage we 've already shot with Jamie jury and our suppliers it will include advertising and social media with some key statistics from the water smart package out comes the water saving tips will focus on outdoor water usage given that we know that 70 to 80 percent of the water usage is outdoors in Townsville key messages like water twice in the dry and never in the wet check identify and fix leaks in your area Moksha yard which plants and create a watering creating a water efficient garden and also cover up the pool in addition there will be further information on the Horton pipeline as it nears completion and the recycled water reuse scheme the campaign will include static billboards with key information on becoming a water smart city promotional videos social media content reviewing the water smart package will get to meet some of the locals who have taken up the package some of the good news stories and also some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact it 's had on their businesses the campaign will be reviewed on an ongoing basis during the wet season and adjusted depending on if we get a good wet or not working with the community will continue from February 2020 onwards in stage three of the campaign and include press digital adverts billboards fun TV commercials social media event and community displays we are also looking at with AAC during a short DaCosta video looking at the success in Townsville and what it 's doing and what it 's achieved so far so as we know the water smart package was announced way back in July 2017 with ten million dollars funding from the Queensland Government our goals in the program were to firstly foster the adoption of water efficient behaviors and practices appropriate for council driest tropics environment secondly provide financial support to the community to increase the uptake of water saving methods and devices and thirdly provide economic opportunities for local businesses by entering into commercial supply arrangements to deliver products and services under the scheme it 's been nothing short of phenomenal the computer the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the numbers are on this slide we are just shy of 19,000 households and we may have clicked over that while I 've been in this meeting I didn 't check and that 's in just over eight weeks that is just short of our target of 20,000 households and in even better news we actually think we 're going to exceed our target because not every house taking up the full amount we always aimed for 80% of the program funds to go directly into the rebates and the garden support packages that means eight million more than eight million dollars is flowing into local business our website incredibly has been viewed more than six hundred and eighty six thousand times seen at C OB yesterday the website is not only the mechanism by which people access the program but it 's also an important education space for people to find out about the three point water security solution as a whole important water saving tips so it 's great to see it getting a lot of attention we are incredibly proud of what this program has achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of 90% of the program funds being allocated there are over 150,000 products and services that have been ordered by water smart participants with the top three being we have 90,000 plants on offer 23,000 cubic meters of mulch to deliver to Alma to over seven thousand households and almost eighteen thousand low-flow sprinklers as the top three and importantly we could not have done that without all the local businesses that are on board to deliver this package I think it 's important to outline that there are also dozens of other businesses which are benefitting indirectly by providing products and services to our suppliers we have estimated that the package has created a hundred direct and indirect jobs in Townsville the no cash outlay option of the garden support package continues to be the most popular offering with over 90% of the uptake we are also getting really good uptake from the community entitled to social support services with well over 5,000 households registered the individual rebates while only 10% of the orders coming through still represent more than 3000 water saving devotion in household water usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this program cannot be forgotten it is this with the recycled water scheme that will seek to reduce potable demand which means council can avoid having to invest in significant capital infrastructure costs of to build a new water treatment facility any time in the near future this is a good thing for ratepayers as it means they will save the community money I 'd like to finish by highlighting some of the good news stories from the package which are represented by these images on the screen and make me feel really proud to be a Townsville person the top two images were taken at the endeavour foundation endeavour Foundation is a great organization with a vision to support people with an interest of intellectual disability to live their best life including by providing life skills learning the Endeavour foundation has been engaged by one of our suppliers might attend to construct a compost bins compost bins have been incredibly popular in the garden support package with more than with almost 8,000 of them on order however some of them are obviously quite big and bulky so frightening them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Addison 's might attend engaged contacted their headquarters in Melbourne and requested them to come up unconstructed so that they can take up a lot less space they 've then engaged the services of Endeavour foundation to construct them here in Townsville and to deliver them to might attend as required this means might attend saves on freight items can get here quicker and Debbie foundation gets to provide life skills to some amazing people and water smart customers get their compost bins quicker the image on the bottom left is a BB double arriving at mitre 10 last week loaded with 660 worm farms I show this image to demonstrate the indirect impacts of the water smart package whereby transport companies are also benefiting from the work associated with delivering products to Townsville the last two which are a little bit hard to read there but I 'll read out these are two bits of feedback we have received from some of the customers that have been involved in the water smart package I find this incredibly overwhelming not only because these people are taking up the package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and thank us hello I would like to congratulate TCC for the wonderful incentive of the water-wise campaign I 'm so grateful for the garden supplies that I 've been entitled to and I look forward to getting them and using them in my garden I am very impressed with the worm farm that I ordered it will make such a big positive difference on my plants as well as recycling my veggie scraps please pass on my sincere thanks to the project project managers as well as other workers from TCC who have done a great job putting this together thank you the second one says good morning I 've now received all of my water smart package I want to say thank you to Council for a great package not only is this all great stuff but I also got to visit businesses I didn 't know anything about so thank you very much just this week I 've also been contacted by the Queensland Council of Social Services who have heard about our water smart package and we 're wanting to understand the factors behind our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our success as they believe it could hold the key to better water conservation programs being rolled out across Queensland and have asked us to provide them with recommendations for other water providers I 've been compiling all of this positive feedback into a document which I circulate to my team who are working very hard on this package none of us we are incredibly proud of what we are doing and all of us know the importance of watch that what this package represents to the Townsville community Thank You councillor Colin Doyle [Music] who are the be in this room with a we have a project motor giving you the data and telling you the story that please take a chair and do what it 's appropriate and I 'll Tina we 're gonna press on the speed of the earth knowing that moving impressed the package took great work that you 've done with a team that 's an Australian first and we 've had this feedback national in an estate level of the good work this package because it picks up the people in the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair go it 's been snapped up very quickly over six hundred and eighty six thousand hits that 's three point five hits for her person that lives in the city so that tells where they 're engaged you 've done you 've engaged well a hundred fifty thousand products and services twenty three thousand cubic meters of marks it 's in itself as a recycling process of green waste to see were in France a recycling of green waste kitchen waste and to engage people with a disability that had want some value in their life it ticks all the boxes so we 've done the quadruple bottom bottom line we 've engaged the community we 're in great environment outcomes we 're educating the community we 've got young people involved what more can we do we just go at the end call the good story like counseled or just said we as I continually tell the positive switch will always get people that are negative and they want to cherry-pick an item here and there or get on social media and bang on because I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive influence err keep up a good work don 't be dejected by that and you 've got a team of councils that will back you all the way thank you yes here can I make a point toward present this was Inger 's sixth presentation I have been fascinated by the fact that this one has drawn so much interest the other five have been on our website the data that sits within this has been gained progressively all the information has being available and the media have been present during the previous five presentations I don 't know if it was the media that are at this meeting can I make the point that these presentations have always presented the facts as they 've been through the project and the program director for this project has been responsible for those so the facts that you 've seen in these ones are cumulative but I would like people to go back because in fact hard copies were made available and those should exist somewhere in the offices and I think it 's an important statement to make that today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first presentation that Inga did as a commitment to keep the councillors and the community aware of this probably the most important project in the history of the council it is vital to understand that it was always meant to be a three point water security package it is because of the quality of the work that 's been done by Scott Moorhead Inga and the entire organization in delivering all three stages of this package that will secure the long-term future for water to a community that had gone through nine on seven years the threat this was continued through a flood event as well was disrupted the community and you saw the presentation from Greg Bruce which again points to the quality and wanton of work that is being delivered by this organisation across our entire local government area it is difficult for me not to try and represent the facts that this organization and missile package is one of them has in many instances presented itself not just as normal business as usual but as best practice everyone knows the fight that we had to fight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that within the report that was presented to the federal government one of the most important items that was stated in that report was that the way that this organization delivered stage 1 was exemplary and this practice in particular based around the number of jobs that it created and it stayed specifically by the project team to ensure that local businesses benefited from this so the project like all our projects not only is predicated by the importance of the specificity of the individual project but it is a matrix across all the projects to support the economic development the creation of jobs and the pillars of this council established some three years ago by supporting gap Paul Johnston when it comes to planning has shown that rather than the isolated incidents that are continually put forward there has been a progressive match in relation to planning and the way it 's been managed in the city of Townsville Greg Bruce showed the importance of the planning around recovery I make the statement that I 'm aware but the guidelines that exist say that the environment is not considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight to ensure but council receives the services that it deserves and that all those services around that one thing in particular and that 's supporting the community through the most difficult of times and into a far more prosperous future thank you thank you see ya well said hear hear congratulations against to the team Thank You councillor Doyle [Music] we [Music] that maybe sometimes with it some counselors will move on thank you there 's no more minutes they were going to the committee items now starting with infrastructure services committee I 'll hand over to counselor mark Maliki no thank you yep absolutely I moved by Councillor monsuno

Colin Doyle [Music] Berlin City Council of Iran second that in discussion around my to one virtual mean about silver very young woman a very poor now coming around I feel awkward to the but does fall against the door we can 't do what governments of thank you River City Council calling door can 't do any discussion [Music] good thank you I 'm just lighting the island about a few four [Music] drop but they will remain that without financial would be a way that we and the ministers quantify that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the votes all those in favor against carried unanimously Thank You counsel Coons now we 're go on to officers report item 17 who 's going to speak that we get an Indian structure and operation in South mr. Bissell set spawn I 've got to do I 'm just sorry that he moved its a customer and business reporting Porter for performance as we come to every corner this in some of the ways with the financials came so that we 've now reported this is the last quarter of the last financial years and basically it 's I think we can show that we had a pretty successful year in most most places we had some performance in but were hindered and hampered by the flood event but otherwise on that was a pretty good result here think during after that any comment or discussion from counselors in relation to that okay we need to have a mover on that on counselor Maliki no seconded counselor rush cook I 'll put it to the votes in the down further discussion all those in favor against unanimous we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to this a bit bit wrong never but wrong [Music] especially lots of more questions [Music] they counsellors a submission was received by a partner of firm from one of general containers so having received a submission from a donor strictly under the bill para requirements that would leave potentially to a perceived conflict of interest affecting the entire team that 's just the way the new legislation works so a suggestion to to the chairs that this would be one of those matters humanness that we 've had there 's a majority conflict report manner to be done as a mannequin bill power changes that are going to the CEO any quit having taken questions this is all the course was a third-party submit up as dynamically Jenny Hill my budget submission has sufficient to give them an interest of taking leaves the tank on majority point of interest as well did I do it okay thinking that I did of that time see [Music] well all that point counselor greenies we have to be very careful decided this is never good to see out only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilation or frustration we clear as council of the elected I represent the counter offer people council where we will have input while these decision makers we don 't have any control over the legislation we passed my estate my building frustration and we have raises on several fronts and I 've heard from a couple of you counselors throughout the week that we want to have a say on what how we shaped our city yes we are frustrated about current legislation as we 've been here as we just heard from the chief legal officer this is within edge of the wedge so I don 't discuss the actual item because of the legal ramifications but I have heard it 's all loud and clear that we are frustrated that we can have input to how we shape our for shortboard City moving forward and we have got other issues but keep in mind it 's it 's only minor on some of these compare the amount of applications that go through this council and the work that we 've done to progress applications it tends to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to court and challenge some of those approvals so we just have to leave it there it has been noted several times that we are frustrated but can we just look at I 'd it made any relation to that recommendation that I need a move in a second in relation to this that yes absolutely councillor Jacob [Music] if you can actually write that with the delegates of this council ELT acute coryza Gentiles business people absolutely our councils that even rising with difficulties of doing business in blocking our users need legislation support a good one ever talked about the Charter for yourselves to represent the city the LPO here to see the pancha permits might be so even though this is the and the Cielo can correct me the fourth out of 71 that have been delegated to the chief executive it the point is that it 's still four that have had to be delegated to the chief executive so the representations councilor Jacob have been made directly to the minister and to the departments from counselors but also from the offices but I support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Local Government Association of Queensland where they will have a united voice from seventy-seven councils that all have the identical legislative issues I think you see Owen together comment from councils those hundreds all refer to have a look at a highlighter that it 's being with third Judah Bell Cara legislation and a recorded conflict different the council needs mic majority the corrections usual form say this the reason for the interest sufficiently my toner which i think is not Frank dollars and I see any of that yeah okay heavy that color counselors not just another kickboxer that I guess thank you I just need a move it to accept that recommendation on item 18 mover counselor Emery greenie second counsel Maurice ORS oh no further comment or debate will put to the vote those in favor against carried thank you now wish me to get back to the agenda proper they 're not now anything else you want to say Co would general any general business obvious got one just a late autumn just that that came to nothing serious nothing serious I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first one art is Nick Mitchell young fellow from towns about 16 years of age from Oak Valley was here at the grammar school very good up-and-coming rugby union player now gone to Tama to be in the thick of rugby union Australian rugby union there 's now been selected as of today for the Australian teams at 16 and he has been playing up in the 18 and 19 s says a rising star so remember that Nick Mitchell I 'm sure the terms of bulletins already started the story on that today going from what done his mother 's Tommy I 'm excited it 's another legend being made here in town such excited when it comes to the sport it 's going to share that with you [Music] school the possible in China yes [Music] well the automation was fantastic link to that just bringing one matter up in general business it 's actually an invite for yourself to be me to attend a trade mission later in October you may want to present us to counsel yes in allowing for the fact that we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Council for approval so just explain the council does what it is it 's an invite for a b c at the right naming the properly forwards Australia New Zealand trade mission to top China they sent me an invite about a week ago but there 's zero cost to counsel as a keynote speaker now I did one a couple of years ago as a legit one belt one one road and Silk Road logistics forum this is a follow on some power from that it 's very similar my only issue is first it 's going to be relevant to what we as a council do when we 're chasing investment and advanced technologies and artificial intelligence I say there is a lot of virtual reality stuff in the planning world the other one is getting advice from the federal government if it 's worthy or in relation to safety and in relation to national security issues and all the relevant authorities not that there 's anything that will be overly aware there 's just that we do the right checks before we do anything at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no cost to Council it 's an invoice on the logistics and artificial intelligence and some other expose over a I think it 's a seven day period so I just want to put that on the record I just wanna have that acceptable account so that I attend if it makes all relevant conditions need a mover for that new counsel or Esau 's second dead duck counselor able on those in favor against unanimous thank you business Maps individual vehicles they also promised a RSPCA I expect them and some thirty years he was also a medial president Secretary of Treasury and on the medians for the campus and he sadly passed away earlier this month meets are possible be God really in the universe I inevitably don 't see serve a

petitions there are none there are no deputations there are no notices of motion we do have a presentation around recovery and an update and I think it is important that some of these discussions are had at the council so if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise that the recovery we have four separate areas that are looking after the recovery of the city this is only one area of council so I don 't want people to misconstrue that this is the only thing we are doing over the next couple of months the number of these groups will come forward and give their presentation so that the community has an understanding of how recovery is being managed sorry now please go ahead Danny actually constructed and the Gustav Gustav III due to these this situation who had now been required to build a new bridge a punk the way contribute plan and to waste sell so we 've put submissions into Queensland reconstruction Authority to support us in funding again just an update on air transport and stormwater we currently to send this pedestrian bridges and 35 traffic and we 've actually done see CCTV network over 600 kilometres of stormwater so again we 're just a bit put of these permissions we can now get together for the Qri through really just an example of a couple of the emergent works that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water from quickly scare of the rugged we 've been able to complete that work and remove works and at Google white Kevin there was a complete washout I believe brief certainly a massive project but again we 're able to do this with the motor for exam it was a number of projects like that better than critical so this is only a couple incidences that [Music] you just have to make it to the other one the river way through an Art Center the big thing with the pool is actually getting the switchboard to the parks up and running so my aim is to have the pool of around holidays so we received confirmation from the insurance company and the switchboard to get that open canvas holiday again I 'll show you some photos it 's the actual moisture that got into the building and in behind the walls and that 's what causes a lot of moment we have to get a hydrologist reports before we can reopen that building though we 're trying to again have the main building open for the December school holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how much work we have to go do with the scheduling and the stripping of some of these buildings and removing all the ceilings and so it 's basically going back distraction do you define again the pool pump rooms though the middle water was through there so it blew almost which wards and all the pumps that they all have to be replaced so again they 're on strike now smart enough to do the order of the switchboard anyway the game is down at the bottom of the shower rule at all some all multiple come on they will touch a strip all that back and again through the four years the pet removal was Shady you can see the plastic there and the trailing of them honestly it is a massive job I don 't think there 's any room in the health building that isn 't effective so it 's basically spectrum again in the hallway again so we 've got the it 's pretty cool again you just have to replace all of voice systems of the pudding settings now then put back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor capture strip the whole Bil 'in to prep the hole in the wall or again it 's a massive project might make for us but now complete just the other thing is on Friday we program ahead to see our categories leave budgets and chemical sleep so we actually submitted three hundred submissions or product to the reconstruction Authority so massive and that 's particularly the strip was the leech it 's an incredible any questions for Danny quantum of work that they have taken it 's just unbelievable way is fantastic considering how hot will be and also that I have seen him the fact that they 've been able to get into this a big fear it was a massive thing Thank You Khalid cancelled oh I think I just would like to add some statements just that I think there are members of this community that continually like content maybe a stage Danny obviously this is the sentiment in this chamber is one of support for the work the counseling staff have done particularly under your leadership in that of the CEO please pass on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crew are working to ensure that many of these facilities are up and running as quickly as possible and the contractors as well we 've had some excellent support from our local contractors here in the community in relation to the uninitiated in counselors I know the majority of you know this category seemed there is a quantum of dollars that is actually spread between 39 council area so the importance of not only giving the submissions in on time but to get them to a particular quality that best states the case where we require to get our fair share of the money that 's made available by both the federal and in the state government so I just remind everyone we 're talking about 240 two million dollars spread between 39 counsel so that the importance of getting the submissions in in the time that they 've got me thank you mad at me thank you see I now I believe there is one other presentation if I could ask India to come forward Thank You India and this is about the continuation of the water @ @ @

item for separately the second different items one two four please Thank You counselor Walker is there any discussion from the chair committee recommendation and that one was the gate application we 've just recommended from the committee side that we go back here and just do a bit more consultation with the possible users of the area to make sure we get a decision deciding I 'm really pleased like I said I can 't talk about oil into relation to former councillor Noah Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson in the late 1997 yeah and I 've known all my life as the Baker in a new when I was a child is involved in the sports town dice and many other things and it 's a real pleasure to talk about this but no one was having a sexual birth even a park named after him and it 'll have a little bit of history recorded at that location as well so it 's very fitting that the team here in council has recognized that my thing all the council 's are met and the professional staff here in council there worked in this space to get this out back when I spoke the family just races now very emotional they 're all crying just couldn 't believe this was happening and it 's bright so somewhat I think it 's named for that and look forward to the moment that and there that you 'll be there when that depart and everything we are bothered them very much thank you Thank You counselors I had the pleasure of serving with Noah Wilson from 1997 to 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served on council from 1979 to 2000 21 years as a counselor it 's a long time and he 's division he 's division included obviously anoon bur parts of Rio yesterday boundaries tended to shift quite a bit in those days know was a life member of the Dahlia Rover sporting club he was found Queens gained sorry North Queensland Games Foundation one of their foundation members as well he was part of the North Queensland field days the castle sporting club in his official role as a councillor he was also in those days we used to be able to appoint councillors to the Port Authority because the up until the port was taken away from from this community or when it was taken away the agreement originally was that a member of Council would serve on the Port Authority and Noah was a representative on that he also served on the Townsville fair n 'gou a joint local government board that board was put in place rather than two rather than a milkmaid both councils in the early 2000s it didn 't work very well and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the North Queensland water board and on the board of the then cemetery trust naal served this community very well he was he was a good local representative who did the job not only for his division but also for this city and it 's with pleasure that were able to announce today that will but overall after counselor Noah Wilson all right I do have one item I do want to speak about and if I can counselors if we look to item for the accreditation of our laboratory services to test for defects you might ask why I 'm I would rise to speak on this and I think it 's very important many of you know that in a previous life I had been involved in laboratory services and had actually put a number of labs through Naito accreditation for accreditation it 's difficult to get accreditation but it 's even more difficult to have a new testing ratio and accredited by NASA in this day and age there are all sorts of issues now affecting local government and sadly PFS is one of the issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services under Scott 's they still sit under you in water they do and Edgar Salvador who is thought about the laboratory manager Edgar and his team have done very well to achieve accreditation for the testing of this substance and it 's known as I 'll give you its full name per and poly fluoro alkaline substances they are the substances that have been used regularly by RAF and army fire authorities that have now caused some issues particularly around bases around oki and Amber Lee the southeast but they are issues now for us in Garbett and elaborate it is a require it isn 't a requirement of counsel at this stage but I think it 's pertinent that they 've taken it upon themselves to gain this accreditation ladies and gentlemen we will have the younger by tree in North Queensland I think Scott I think it would be the only one outside the southeast corner that would be accredited to do this testing correct the only local government lab to be accredited for this testing sadly I suspect that a laboratory will have to do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Australian guide our drinking water guidelines that we have that we must be able to test for these substances counselors I just want to highlight the good work that is being done by our staff not just in recovery but ensuring that we get along with business as usual all right we have a mover and a seconder being no further discussions I 'd like to put that to the vote for items 1 to 4 all those in favor against carried unanimously and now I 'd like to move on to item 5 to the chair do you wish to the original conditions were left in confidential so counselor dear wish to amend the recommendations or the boy a lot to amend that we include the recommendations in the underneath one so we 've got a kind of a bottom four listed as the recommendation from Council thank you actually

and they developed a hybrid fruit that will heighten flavor or in debt to the yields they need to get productivity the message let me give you some insight without Big Daddies type-ahead Taiwan has a population of Australia on a landmass half the size of Tasmania so they have got a landfill and but they they want to invest with us in agriculture where we can grow the food things like that which is exciting this dislike here and what I 'm left is similar to a bus is coming on trial in each week which is a lot hottest vehicle this one is building fire one better twelve cedar is rather one of these ridges on the problem ease in ten who 's just Bullock farmers yeah this one that 's even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passing module that screws to the top it has a little camera and it reads of digits in real-time and usually the radio network we can 't be having a city free of charge so it 's actually very smart technology it has currently based in Sydney and in trollers Australia my question to them while in relation to the plastics the last photo is an automated bus station is a solar-powered and provide information on the next destination or other desolation if you wish to get you that promote the city and choosing accommodation and it also has a camera and telephone and Public Safety spinning in their face that 's the route the light units and the license which has to be in

for all those who I played and they are lucky to run the fire control somewhere in the world of that 's like a one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and was built and the highest energy rating in the world and still holds some records in 2002 under construction the plank to cranes problem killing five people which is quite insane 20 the upside was the building suspended in any way so they went on as a big counterweight very large Cadillac de Bergerac like the gentleman with me is the manager of the facility that some 105 101 floor building with five floors underground which is over 300 ladies pylon today to me discipline the to go that corporate gifts or local religions are just too quick widest to get back there because you 'll see was he important because amazed you saw enough and I think that 's working his face and he definitely can his face on startups and this is a spark landing point Taipei Taiwan tech arena was their big indoor stadium they 've got a tech that there and this robot that I 'm with in the middle actually talks and blinks since I put his hand up will shake in will hold your hand to one of them that was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people here that study will do anything bad and we 've offered the same to them if they want to do some researching about the last one this is the latest in medicine and University Hospital Taiwan these vegetable so in English someone have to put any devices under the body they cannot lightly slide let 's prove that interrupting personal sleep and I can move around really easily without any back injuries all the other devices the latest technology in medicine this is a research and development space with a torment and they 're open to having partnerships here in Australia with the latest in medicine the general the top right was in a top hospitals and he worked at worked in Australia six months this is my last one just for those games a lotta clear talk about some gamers but here in the city this console here is a full-width bed reconcile that actually leaves the floor moves when you 're in a fighter jet it means water as a product if you video right as a train or a tank and that whole wall in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it actually takes my whole room but they can excuse us in the public arena a lot of PlayStation that CBD this is four five six around share so they have a chair that technology and work on that space I 'm taking things to the other using artificial intelligence but this box I was actually used in in in modules for trying for fighter jets trying to others tank drivers in industry this is a white transition into that space that make it fun that same industry as well just want to share this not really cooking with the thing we 've got out of forty three solid contacts and I 've shared something from a and Softbank that is what I biggest in the world that if you didn 't talk to us and any future investment thing could thank you participating moving forward in green energy in smart technology our visual intelligence and robotics but I 'll talk about that but think of your kid yes mr. sting arrange to some of the International pockets that they 're a bunch of learnings and I was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities very efficient contacts there and we had a ton of business fierce veterans actually travel with us to take a look at some of the smart city technologies to see how we 're moving forward and I think our smart precinct potentially looking to have a partnership agreement the toilet area so that we can plate of all of the liens that we 're looking to enter the Australian market here and then vice versa for entrepreneurs from out of this precinct program to be able to touch down time point out to counselors that councilor Walker also went as the North Queensland region of council rep the invitation came through the Local Government Association in partnership with trade invest Queensland so many local councils need to be able to to access expose like this but quite often can 't afford to do it by themselves so the relationship when using the rocks to manage that is quite significant the concern I 've had is the number of South East Queensland councils who have greater financial capability who are attending these forums now are making it harder for regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message across the big one for us though and I think in the short term is the big rocks we 're which allows 5,000 hectares of land to go under irrigation it would be a and I know the mayor of charters towers is keen to form some sort of partnership with a person who wishes to actually use that land for food production not just for cattle grazing so I think a country like Taiwan that 's looking for food security could go no further south than staying here in North Queensland where I think we be able to work with them the first time I ever tried to pair they 're going to try page so the upside to that if we win as well as I see as a region because we go screw up cool so there 's plenty of model to try thank you I want as many volumes about the quality weekend and we have a very new colors in there market that really need to be exported to Taiwan which is a good story and it comes like and this necklace develops anemones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knot on one that we have a great size for this year that council can we now move on to the next presentation which is the recovery subgroup human and social in [Music] I really like to stress to you the disasters are about me and that is 42 disasters and first an impact is about managing its fortunately that 's always a dog has always be about both temps which recovery and its long-term resilience that the city strategies to the activities [Music] they 're just a couple of eggs for you we 'd be meeting some [Music] [Music] we 've already actually series of tasks [Music] we 've reached some fun we 've done some really enjoy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] some of the things specifically summer would be for Queensland bugs at the present moment has industry we 're very lucky that there 's still some donations coming in instead i back to China does Chinese toot-a-loo in terms of bicycle support institutions so every time [Music] 27 instances of just to chicken communities this slide to reflect strike after debate and we 've got that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doesn 't take long the recovery journey typically takes a little sliding I 'll show you this this is more this is what happens in all recoveries after all disasters you can also go ladies with the stages of the grief process and we see that in our community as well and whilst I 'm sure that many of us would want to make sure that be able to take it all the way it 's part of the recovery process on this sort of journey what we can do is to build community resilience and a resilient community has a watchtower trough so that Sarah you said the next time Townsville is impacted by a disaster just [Music] we returned a long time the impact on some of our residents particularly so we ended up building and developing a community rebuild project still in it 's pretty close but if he 's going to do so it 's garbage to see stars effective placement we have access to the resources they need to make their homes it 's about recovery it 's also about resilience to save homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected it is community late this initiative is being driven by a very small group committee continents beginning with the combined churches and service groups and a few on this ground we 're working this up and we 'll be reaching out as a community it 's based on about the vapor from the Bundaberg road son with the Commissioner to decapitate you come up with this idea we actually have with someone who 's done something similar before but we 're taking it and we 're adapting it to the townsmen situation it reaches a volunteer work force with the right supervision many rights fields of these during even helping to rebuild using generative materials we obviously to help us with this as we progress everybody from industry organizations through the individual businesses community groups fight grunts all champions we do last we do such a sweet face trick this is totally not knocking on doors this time we go into where people are under the branding of team Townsville we 're sitting still are the community to come and talk to us that 's providing an opportunity here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for some people if you matter just send police to land something you might may have checked to us and just the act of talking through is beneficial the others they come up towards their needs are much greater so we have to see referral centers and we saw we beseech that these sorts of activities that are disjoined next review will probably be on training for 12 months 90 up to two years so here it is social recovery will be active for a long time to come so please watch this okay any questions from counselors I think the work we know that recovery will take a long time counselor doll I thank you for your leadership as part of this group and to all the staff that are working on this there isn 't one and I 'm sure all of us know people who were still struggling and we 've got to still got a big job ahead of us in terms of dealing with the the personal anguish that many people are going through because as the and thank you all of you thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret all right we have thank you will now go to open you have been a busy bee [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

friends and everybody you know is to this was a project that you began it 's not just about this project madam mayor and councillors I I just wanted to make the point that you 've just seen Margaret present in relation to extraordinarily important pieces of work for this council Margaret is one of many in this organization that since the flood have been performing a jewelers at your functions no additional staff however without exception Margaret is implemented of the offices of this council who took on the role of not only meeting their obligations from a business-as-usual point of view but meeting the extraordinary obligate obligations and commitment that you 've seen to project such as building resilience through the recovery I acknowledge the support of councillors through the process but I just wanted to take the opportunity madam mayor it is easy sometimes to be critical with an organization however the reality of the situation is that Margaret is a living example and Margaret I 'm not just seeing that it 's signally new out I know that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the group at the back that have been heavily involved in performing functions that are seeing them work extraordinary hours to ensure that not only is our community been given the best opportunity to recover from a disastrous event but that our business as usual continues to ensure the resilience of the community is met by all thank you [Applause] Thank You CEO and thank you to all the staff we know it 's been difficult and as the CEO pointed out there are many of you doing two jobs at the moment one around recovery and business as usual and I 'm hopeful that once the money starts coming from Q through q ra based on the guidelines that support is on its way and Ali said help we have one final one final presentation today and that 's the liveability study 2019 in the findings counselors this is I think an important plank in how we proceed into the future for this community so if we can thank you we 've been out [Music] [Music] so the liveability study is to understand what opportunity cancer data values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really understand what they value and now ideal maplewood what 's really important to them and the second one with about ratings and Bank work around town the character survey revealed that the community 's top street names are elements of the natural environment general conditions of public open spaces and a sense of neighborhood simple neighborhood and personal safety access to cons of public transport condition and quality of common spaces are areas for improvement the k-factor survey also reveals the strengths to be celebrated and promoted as being relevant businesses access to neighborhood and amenity and elements of the natural environment across the five neighbors East driving and parking was the highest performing entropy but the data shows that it wasn 't as highly valued at sac-n-pac to serve a unique buildings local history and things to do an evening with a lowest rate eventually identified magnitudes and I think that was shocked by some of the results of the mobility study one of the things that Fela did surprise me was that we felt a little very well covered in terms our regular infrastructures the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted that was more of active and healthy transport the importance of the community taking part of the survey to me community to articulate and tell us what 's important and what they value but not only that the data is evidence-based which has a huge amount of validity in moving forward from a planning perspective we would love to repeat this the first part of character every four years so we can see how our communities change that also will do our place experience every one or two years ago in different places and they all saw the same places to see if their investments actually paid off and people are enjoying faithful for more information about the project visit council website the whole LTA that we 'd like to be that the community likes to be close to make sure and it would like to be well doctor if we say it would be connected by active public transport and local amenities and businesses there was really in the open-ended questions we saw huge response there in regards to our so need to be assessments over there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then and then we can break it down over those five dimensions so that to those surveys and so we can really understand that we need to make [Music] this will help us really understand so these are the young ideas could change so at the end of each question I didn 't teach them that a question would such a big or small idea different social interaction [Music] huge responsive because to active transport [Music] thank you any questions you study there was five locations over way how many the elf narrow narrow like nations were involved compared to the O to the towns for city like fashion so I didn 't see too many the author and Gayle and this is just the first round so in some places like you know except to make they literally concentrated in the city here rather than sort of looking at the peripherals what the upper else is through this so only five areas got picked council staff to determine based around the strategic framework of the city plan so you would be aware that for example under the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban footprint in Farren gawa we allow for example along dark not telling our drive along rasa River Road there 's areas there that we 've allowed three and five stories for businesses and apartment so it 's about looking at how we create what is important to people what we need to keep in our planning framework and how we can improve the delivery of infrastructure thank you all right thank you everyone that sound finishes the presentations maril minute councillors and this was actually flagged by the staff if I can begin in October 2018 council committed to the establishment of a smart precinct and queue as part of the smart cities strategy and smart Townsville Community Partnership obviously that strategy was endorsed by this council and in reality actually fits in as part of our city deals process as well since that time council has been engaging with various sectors of the community to seek input into establishing a new hub for innovation to support the new and emerging businesses and entrepreneurs across North Queensland today I am pleased to announce that smart precinct NQ Limited has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cook University verdict in Shire Council fierce

appointed as Townsville City Council 's inaugural director on the board of smart precincts in Kew Limited ladies and gentlemen we 're all aware that we have seen a number of industries begin in the north and sadly leavers such as Jersey transport their footprint here is much smaller and because we cannot get the people into North Queensland we 've had one of our great startup safety culture have to employ and create a business unit in Sydney there 's a real need for this so that we can future-proof our city for the new economies and ladies and gentlemen they keep coming to us very fast so the

just some notes on the purpose of the community safety plans to encapsulate councils current and future response to community safety and provide avenues for export in this space the plan provides tangible links the council 's learning 20 budget through areas such as CCTV network community safety authority the community safety plan pods clean delineation between the levels of government and respective levels of responsibility while hollowing councilors key focus on areas of safe places safe people and say facts collaborative partnership to emphasize an important factor in communicating this plan also see this is another election promise that we 're following through and a lot of Thank You Vicker in a team commitment and sadly I continue to get emails from residents asking me to provide policing firstly on private property which we cannot do and secondly we are not the police force nor are we the federal and state governments with their financial capability to deal with some of the the issues that are around the city I hope that the community safety plan as we progress through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to now hold the other levels of government accountable for certain aspects in and around this community thank you anything further counsel adore we had a seconded anyway that was can a my apologies seconder counselor writer thank you are there any further

thank you Malkina are there any questions thank you can 't comments counselor right sorry the presentation for the curbside collection up though it 's just I just wanted to give some feedback that a lot of the residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since we 've done a curbside collection so obviously there would be issues in the first year the second year they 've been able to condense it into under seven months and I think as he said we there were there were a lot of learnings taken from the very first time so that 's good feedback to get from the community yes council elections and also the communications that we 've done on what to put out to pretty well in my division AB speak for everybody else but thank you any other comments can I just ask quickly on the water smart package a presentation was done since that time how I think we 're coming very close to the end for the water smart package [Music] and that 's been an excellent partnership between Queensland Government Council and our local industry if I may madam mayor the has been an extraordinary pick up excuse the pun straight after curbside collection but the the way the community has responded to this package I 'm fairly confident that will achieve 100% of all the money expended I am struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that achieved 100% so again it 's an extraordinary effort by the all the members of the organisation that have been involved sir thank you it 's been an excellent outcome Council that means this is really state the state government has trusted us to deliver this program and as we noted at the very beginning of doing this most of the programs were lucky if you had a thirty to forty percent uptake so the staff took away the learners came back and took a while but came back with a with the process that met both the Queensland ordered office expectations and a marketing plan that seems to have actually connected with the community so we should be really pleased with that thank you thank you everyone if there 's no further comment we 'll put those that report to Council for adoption all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you I 'll now ask councillor Maliki know to move his report from infrastructure services please Thank You councillor sauce any comment from the chair but I just want to mention that we forget what hospital services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is taking in the majority of our area but also doing very well business correct to see at least for those boys and they 'd more something which is right so thank you again that 's part of the procurement policy as in the changes we 've made and it 's good to hear a good news cycle good news local story local good news story Thank You cancer it 's been a long day already alright are there any other comments if not then I will ask councils we will put this to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously I 'll now ask council Walker to present his Planning and Development Committee report council Walker Thank You Sabrina that includes the report for inroad Garbett okay okay thank you cancers are there any any discussion from the chair to begin with of that report any counsel it 's counselor rod madam mayor I just wondered just with the item number 36 certainly I just I understand there 's a lot of small businesses and businesses that do the right things and they apply for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get clear in my head that right so they 've got the business from a rental place or a wherever they 've opened up the business without the proper licenses there 's been a complaint we 've shown given on the show show notice and then if they 've got certain conditions they have to do and then once they do those conditions they 'll be accepted in favor to run a business there and in the meantime we 're going to are we able to get some sort of report in the months that they actually do all these there 's a lot of people do I dislike really I 'll show you some sort of I think that does open up businesses they are making application and then beg for forgiveness like because it puts us in a terrible predicament and then way the voice person who will when we find increases thank you our house counselor Walker 's purse they comment on the reports and the conditions I think you hit E and W a traditional deep south the relaxing part of opportunity and but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other comes to cancel this night is given conditional condition to stop there this is what you dig we take the cost fishing stuff we don 't go in make sure that everybody 's Palestine that 's gross dansgame speed is up to you certified and those people in the industry this also they do it we value bikes in fact we can be conditioned however this is very stringent emissions in here exactly were official between Allah give us thought okay we good woman on these documents and we take that very party at little importance and evaluate information challenge it was identified that they were operating without approval which they realize they so the issue the whole purpose of that was to give them a chance to rectify the situation and fashion is sponsoring the objections we recommend further conversation with one of the so one of our planets has gone out there at once I explained the process and it will be picked up we reduce the number of dogs that there with 35 at the last four to 25 and your sment or reporting question we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend applies so if there are complaints if investigate official to be a breach of complaints in breach of their condition that correct probably have in communities people don 't understand the governance and particularly around City Planning this if this if this group had bought in a in a different area an area that if they had come sought advice from counsel about their business where they could operate legitimately without requiring to go through a full material change of use we would have been able to give them advice sadly people don 't do this and they take advice from real estate agents often that aren 't fully aware of what the city plan details and while we the recommendation here is to approve there are still submitters out there who we know that it will have a 28 day period that 's correct 28 days to Lodge to lodge an appeal against the conditions or against this application that is their right under the act at this point in time all we can do is consider the conditions that we have here particularly around the noise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report that the noise management the conditions are quite quite stringent okay and this is to ensure that complies with them probable outcome six of a low-impact industry zone code six point five point one and to comply with the recommendations of the noise impact report and they 're established to be established on-site they were within one month of the issuing of certificate of compliance associated with conditions 15 and 16 to be maintained at all times during the life of the development so that includes the acoustic fencing and the noise mitigation so if they don 't maintain that that gives us a right to go back and to go through a process again to close the business down maybe different at least at least the building and then develop business themselves outside of any planning requirement and sadly we tend to see more and more of this people need to understand that you just can 't set up a business we 're now starting to get complaints around home businesses that are no longer home businesses with just one Operator people are now employing three and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to go into those properties and show them a show cause why they should be allowed to operate anymore as a home business so for example a home business is about being established once you 're established and you 're required to hire more people you need to move off-site into another area but people don 't seem to understand that and it 's about protecting the amenity of the rest of the residents and businesses that are co-located in the area councils are might be an opportunity for you in your newsletters to remind people that before they seek to sign a lease on a business to maybe just come in and have a discussion at a council with council and to sign their leases subject to council approval it wouldn 't be that hard to sign a lease with that to ensure that they are able to operate in the area they are about to loose yes council Joe nestled woman is this arm separate do we get the burden this one separately well the did you accommodate this within the wristlet question except the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 'll amend the counselors Walker 's reports too we will look at now thank you so then we 'll move 28 30 31 32 33 34 and 35 are you happy with that counselor Walker and the second time it was the second day got my notes here counselor no counsel greenie you were the second answer you were the second are you happy for if we all right so before we continue this discussion are there any other points of discussions based around item 28 30 31 32 33 34 or 35 if they 're not can i we have a mover and seconder can we put those items to the vote all those in favor against carry now can I have a person move item 36 separately same movers same second up yes thank you and we can continue the discussion now on item 36 so council I 'll go to council militina what we 're saying as you mentioned before I talk to businesses is setting out to that cancel prove the cancel suddenly pick up the faces on and the press is be polling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we dedicate things is wandering the center in crane book define and who losing in that area they did a quick shape on that that was about 400 meters for the nearest residence so to me that 's concerns me now say I believe we 've set some pretty tight boys from strikes between 40 points which I believe most of these gonna be very hard to discompose they are cool soundproofing people more these videos about flooded complaints with the local council have staff to deal with I did cursory search on a line just have a look at what can moves normally run it as far as moves because and they say between 84 so that 's that 's all just business themselves as I said this is an awesome business later on but we need things for businesses and council folk we just need to make sure they like either possibly and unfortunately maybe is that mean yes look I concur with councilor Hollett you know and also with counsel writer but my main concern is that we 're setting a very very bad precedent we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn 't any community constable consultation I don 't know whether there has to be community consultation but we 've missed that step so I don 't want to sit that question as a counselor sorry lady bit I mean when this shop sit so far you know had their dream prior to that any community consultation no yeah no I fully agree but this is concerning animal yeah as well so this stick so because we 've miss that step but I just don 't want us to set a precedent to let all these other people know it 's like driving a car their license and then applying for the department to get your license later but that 's a source situation we have residents there and running businesses this is a result of a long series to imagine those complaints will go away because the thoughts the social animals anxiety is getting to you soon and I don 't cannot see how we 're going to bring that noise down and given that situation too hard to compress the business its business having it said that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his business which is unfeeling for both sides because it would be different for mated to agreement ensure that you announce you clearly to staff in person writing your reasons for objection and they should be based on planning reasons are there any other councillors who wish to speak on this matter if not I will close the debate and we will put this to the vote all right councils those that wish to accept the officers recommendation please raise your hand one two three so we have five those that wish to vote against the officers recommendation please or I could I ask each of you beginning with council Malkina your reasons why what concerns rebels business but counselor right my concerns are about the current noise levels they have put on them and I think it 's my opinion it 's unrealistic thing to do that so I feel the city like yes I 'm so excited before I don 't want to sit sorry I 've stated the reason yeah but what we 've done through the chair yes we 've only add something in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the fact that they accept this business up so counselor that last statement is erroneous to on make two points one in relation to setting the precedent there is a history not only miss County but in large numbers of other councils for in fact as explained earlier a show-cause is to give people an opportunity it isn 't a definition of closure so as far as setting the precedent goes this wouldn 't set a precedent counselor it would be one of many that have been similar where the officers have tried to provide an opportunity that 's the first one the second so I just wanted to rebar the statement of setting the precedent the second one was you spoke about consultation when the premises was first set up we 've established that the premises was set up without them applying three councils so to hold the consultation process on a premises that no one knew was doing it until the complaints came in is a really difficult exercise however is a part of this exercise the appropriate consultation process took place and I 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite appropriate that your objection be based on the planning conditions which is what this particular paper falls within the other two counselors that done exactly the same so the case of setting the precedent is a difficult one to be committed to so but I 'm happy to help you put that together counselor we acknowledge and accept your objection and I will come back to want to just note that under the estate planning Act anyone can apply for anything on any site so even though we may have a site that is here a low impact it doesn 't preclude them from from applying that 's something we have to allow people as part of the State Planning Act it 's about then the conditions if the staff feel it is still acceptable it then comes down to the conditions that are placed around it and whether or not as a council we deem those conditions to be to be suitable to allow the business to operate the community still has the right to take anything to court if it feels we 've been we haven 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for the submitters to go through the planning court on this matter so there 's still a long way to go on this cancer okay we were just completing one part of the process councillor Doyle is objection and it might be if I ask you a question do you believe that it 's in the best interest of the community of interest because that 's a planning reason counselor Jake but if you don 't believe this no I 'm sorry that 's what I 'm suggesting you might wish to say counselor Jacobs that you don 't believe it 's in the best interest of that 's what we have pressure professionals poking at these conditions we need to read them and understand them with NCE precision business Wulfric are you making a comment or are you making fun of me decides the priest in support of Christmas you do that every month and she used but you say this is a number of councils reasons why they 've objected to this and they are well within their rights to do it all I 'm asking from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report you would understand what conditions you can object to this song you 've had two counselors use conditions that they 're not happy with they feel that because of the stringency of the conditions it would be difficult to apply as I said for your objection to this matter to be seen as relevant you should use planning conditions as your guide right and will take into account what you 've now said and will like that whether or not it is relevant that will be seen through the course of time Thank You councillor Jacob I 'll now ask counsellor saws yeah my objection does with the apply and deliver that have come pull their business so all of you will be noted as objecting to this to this item but the item is carried by numbers Thank You counselors will now move on to the final item from your report if we could counsel the Walker is there anything that we need to note on the Heritage Advisory Committee no thank you we will put that now to the vote all those in favor against carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come in now ladies in general we have three other items left if I can I 'd like to bring the addendum up before we move into closed session and ask if we can now go to the addendum item 39 thank you now I 'm 39 if I could ask the officers is like which officer please can I ask someone that we move this report Thank You counselor door seconded councillor greenie all right is there any discussion from the mover on this by caliber organizations it 's not a difficulty do you have anything to say yes just two questions one is what financial supports that we did this organization last you and if 50 formations available how many attended this event last year if they 're people motion is so I 've known about through the records indicates that over the last three or four years we 've supported dear Inc and in a number of different ways not specifically for the performance of Shakespeare another starts this their first application for support of this is a one-off performance when they have been investing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ongoing funding agreements so from treat 2016 in the barriers around the same amount that they 're actually employed which sits around five thousand dollars in cash annually alongside our six thousand dollars of waivers and for venues so he it 's in line with what they 've applied for previously and this time it 's just easier specified that it 's specifically for this one of them the project description that is part of this report that that this year theater in coop inq plans to hold free Shakespearean workshops in partnership with James Cook University to the general public and offer towns for schools of free Shakespeare in workshop with every group booked along with a two-week thirteen performance season the young stars of the show will hold information sessions at school and with the general public about working in the acting industry Council Green particularly theater on you and after attending their palace to the looking-glass Binaca which was fun amazing and there was really something from everyone I was 2 years aged to the majority of the community didn 't do it it was outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancel Jacob and then to cancel maliki know me counselor door yes counselor jacket yeah look the reason I asked for the numbers I want to make sure that the rape phase of the city are getting value so this particular item it can be forces an addendum issue around the original application for the grant and I 'm not sure if anyone can speak on that couple of times but the actual organization itself it 's more it was much more than a simple application for our idea so that 's why it was actually escalated to the next level because the next level actually gave them a partnership support and it 's something that it was beyond what they normally got the numbers Paul they gave us our attempt so Jacob they gave us lots of numbers and they 're actually Milly at capacity every year and and what they 're returning people are actually even travelling to our city now so the actual organization itself I think is at their next level hence why it 's ended up with the partnership program so I think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level to the next level which is where they should have been but we didn 't have that level so can I just say Jacob if you one that offers training and apprenticeships and opportunities through the bridge project for aspiring actors and actresses actresses in Council and many of the people have graduated from the program the bridge program have actually gone on nationally and internationally so what he does for this community is far greater than what helps to grow and expand the talent that contributes to the performances it 's it 's a phenomenal organisation as council right I said it 's gone to the next level it 's absolutely people obtain the performance is it about thank you there 's any map an educational perspective alright counselor and if we into thank you canceling okay in previous applications and fondant environments so Abby was just as a historical no in terms of the value around saying to play 5000 before they I had and they didn 't support from us with issues whose dropped out because they 're only asking for Queens Gardens they 're waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their performance they 'll be required to provide acquittal of all the funding to show due diligence on their heart behalf as well all right we 're dealing with this one is there 's a wish to speak council Walker I was about to close but or on the relation to these are disappointed that this comments right now if I can thank you all right if there 's no for the time we put it to the vote all those in

can I have someone move that the report remain Dean confidential and to that as part of a procurement man asset to Townsville economic development zone as soon as the sole supplier or special service

relationship with Singapore however in July I received a letter from the Ministry of Defense from the Republic of Singapore regarding the establishment of the Australian Singapore military training initiative near Greenville Singapore welcomes this development as an opportunity to deepen their relationship with our city while the Singapore military have been training a child Urbania Rockhampton for more than 25 years North Queensland now has the opportunity to engage with the Singapore military as part of their military training initiative we should be reminding people that this is a massive investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be invested in throughout the the the regions it is important that we build this relationship with singer because over the next 20 years Singapore will be a major player in Australia 's defence profile and the importance of this relationship as a progresses over time cannot be overstated many of the Singaporean soldiers who will be training in our region will go on to senior positions in business and government in Singapore and other parts of the world we need to ensure that these young men feel welcome and see opportunities in our city and regions and what we have to offer as part of the master planning process for the ASM t.ri Singapore 's Ministry of Defence will be working very closely with the Australian Department of Defence and Australian Defence Force to understand how Townsville can support their training and their logistical needs the Singapore government also needs to be assured that their soldiers will be welcome in this city just as we welcome everyone in uniform now with that we 've also been invited to choong-soo in China to participate in a in a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cultural and tourism in also from the 19th to the

we 're using our military advisor John Caligari to assist us in setting up appointments so my lieutenant general Caligari has a number of contacts in Singapore he believes would be appropriate to meet with many of the senior military personnel have trained in Australia and he has personal knowledge of we 're very keen to to understand how we can help them in terms of delivering the training initiative in Greenville anyone else or I put that now if there 's no further comment can I put it to a vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you councils if there is no further general business we 'll close the meeting at 25 thank you all the counselors for your attendance in your and your debate thank you to all the staff as well","(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

Australia",1820,pre-stressed concrete pylons weighing 15 tons were pushed from one location to another cars were blown about beaten and battered shrapnel weighing from hundreds of pounds down the housing bricks rained like confetti and sheets of roofing iron side through the sky after being torn from roofs and shed walls in many areas I remember sort of waking up in the morning and and there was this kind of eerie green look around and and just phenomenal noise and all of sudden all the windows blew wide open and rain was coming inside and I had no idea what 's going on I 've got casement windows and we 're trying to hold them closed to prevent stuff and flying around and we just went into the hallway to keep away from the windows in case of debris and all of a sudden was over it was kind of start finish no idea what went on and we live on a Main Street and all the power lines were down and there was just debris everywhere so it was just a really surreal experience I wasn 't even aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something kind of out of my scope or understanding so I 've had about seven experiences with cyclones Charlie a vu joy Larry quite a few others we had a lot of flooding infrastructure damage so buildings that were damaged from the the winds and things like that we lost power for a considerable amount of time the I went straight over our house in our house itself the actual house roof was within 20 meters of the center of the eye sarcone rated obviously but on four occasions it shook the pressure actually split into your eardrums and make you eardrums like a knife sharp pain in your eardrums but there 's another sound that we could hear because we didn 't have any windows left in the lounge room that they were gone like that but really loud we tried to keep calm but what was the use everything was coming at us and we 're trying to hold windows in and Justin I went to walk away the wall caved in it was only by inches oh yeah everything 's so lovely for Christmas but nevermind we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there are a lot of older houses so pre cyclone condition standard so the house behind me lost its roof we end up with an extra neighbors Ward whirlybird my kids trampoline was completely destroyed fences down most of us fairly superficial but there were houses in suburbs away from us sort of completely destroyed uninhabitable we were probably just on the cusp of it on the other very edge so the winds that they 've done some of the testing and that the winds weren 't as bad where we were but they 're significant enough that don 't braid signs were knocked down and the fences and that were completely destroyed and probably the most frustrating thing is most of Council didn 't know about it we 're oblivious to it and when they say oh we 've gone through is tornado those looking at you what tornado six days of seven days we lost power and unfortunately we did stocked up a lot of frozen veggies and good in our freezer I had two or three freezers count at the time once the power was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've always got cold water bottles which are frozen which keeps the freezer Calder for longer and that says stuff so we just ate all the really expensive meats first and because a lot of the stores were also closed down for the for the same reason accessing fresh food and things like that was a challenge but you just make do with what you 've got and get through as best you can basically just had at barbecues out the front and everyone sort of joined in and wrote what I had before one often we sort of cooked that up and cooked this out and cooked that up it 's really hot after a cyclone the heat waves tend to happen because you 've got all that humidity you 've got all that water and if it 's not raining and we didn 't have any rain after yeah see it 's just really stinky hot houses aren 't built with the same air circulation and ventilation as they once did you know windows don 't aren 't designed to open anymore because we have air conditioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldn 't escape from it and there 's nowhere you can go and there was no electricity so that became a real problem how do you manage that heat stress in that sort of situation how do you get out and avoid it was was quite difficult and I wasn 't quite prepared for it particularly at nighttime that the kids getting to sleep so it got so bad actually went to my work and I slept at my work office for two nights originally in the tropics we 've got lots of moisture in the air during the summer he do get a you get these extreme events occasionally Oh bull 's-eyes and it was it was our turn [Applause] the water level actually came up very quickly a train between 00 and 00 and the evening was enough to put water in all of the houses in town and the rest of the rangering you know it just kept them up just kept the level up it 's certainly unusual to hit a populated Center that 's it one of the major centers that that 's the unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baku in somewhere it doesn 't cause as much trouble [Applause] as the damage was assessed amazing tales of survival emerged it was also the time to start planning the massive cleanup as I say too many people that move into the area if you want to know what the people mover are like wait do you get a major deserter and watch how they all pull together no respect to who they are black white brindle whatever yeah it 's really interesting that locals how they all band together very quickly and start clearing the roads so I would say the roads were clear by tractors and things within a few hours enough that you could get emergency vehicles in there people are trained to respond to these sort of no decision said that 73 of them in the field some of our own ball even lost their I 'm probably but still they continued to volunteer there 's certain triggers for storm season like the wet season which I 'd unit through the yard cleanup and that sort of stuff but this kind of event was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's going to happen and I had sheets on the line I had stuff out and they said the trampoline was completely destroyed if those sorts of things were better secured or put away I probably wouldn 't have had as much damage in my house always be aware of what 's around and minimize if you can what 's new yard keeping a major part of your food supply ready in a vehicle ready to ready to go close emergency documents or see what in boxes ready to go have them in the car make sure you on the car make sure you 've got gas in it for the barbecues etc etc if you bar that all with water even the very basic things of just flashing your toilet going to places like the Townsville website the disaster dashboard just make sure you 're all ready for whatever is about to occur make sure you 've got your kits together that you understand your evacuation plans that you know where you 're going and when you need to go get those packs ready it 's really important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you over plan it doesn 't matter you know just getting those plans ready there 's practical things that you need to remember to do so remembering what do you need to do and looking at you know disaster management sites such as the council City Council making sure you 've got money hey because nothing 's gonna work if you 've lost power you need to have cash you really do if you 've got the capacity to charge your phones up or have a get one of those old fashioned telephones as well it just keeps you connected for that little bit more time knowing that you can go to public websites and find that information obviously council is a good resource as well but there are other like you bomb your Bureau of Meteorology is also a good resource to find out information a lot of your social media platforms is really useful what that does is allows that information to be in spaces that young people are more likely to use in the first place I think it 's also about being peer led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they 've done and how they 've created their emergency evacuation plans and things like that talk about it having those conversation with people what if it is asked to happen what would we do have that discussion if something happens if I 'm at school when a disaster hits what happens so people need to make disasters part of it everyday thinking I ended up getting a little tattooed and that just reminds me to just be brave in times of when I feel a bit scared I guess have you summed that up in it and I 'm not sure what you should be doing now if you live in a community it 's important if you 're part and part of the community yeah you 've got to be involved there 's an old adage and it 's stood for a lot of years a lot of here if you 're not part of the solution you are part of the problem that 's saying something everyone should be living with especially it during the time that 's my point I mean there 's always room @ @ @ @

legal officer and disclosure to us through the chair as countless know there have been recent changes to the local government legislation as part of operation infill Cara that could affect an individual councillors involvement in today 's discussion these changes are now life and introduce new obligations for councils regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may arise included before it matter is considered at fallen councilmen counselors must consider if I have a personal interest that is a material person interest a real or a perceived conflict of interest in any item being considered at today 's session if a councillor has a material personal interest or a real interest for a perceived conflict of interest in a matter today it should be declared as required under local governance for 2009 if a counselor at a meeting reasonable leaves will reason suspects that another counselor has material personal interest or a real compliment real conflict of interest before at the same conflict of interest in a matter being discussed at the meeting today and that council has not informed the meeting about interest the counselor must advise the chairperson of the meaning as soon as practicable about their belief or suspicion and the facts of circumstances that form the basis of that belief or suspicion with that disclosures of interest are there any disclosures which was for this meeting Renault correspondent CEO thank you any petitions you know we were to have a deputation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous not presentations he said so on sorry deputation I have someone here theories or are they not on you if you could please to present some glasses well I 'll see you tonight and everything sorry I 'm Thomas askin representing no food planning for the post-op division development sorry I just had some plans to stuff your life [Music] so thank you very much for providing us the opportunity to present it it 's council meeting basically today we just wanted to discuss this development application that 's currently before council for a rural residential subdivision out of Alice River basically I 'm just gonna do a little bit of background on the on the application it was lodged in December 2018 and as you can see there it seeks approval for subdivision of approximate approximate lis 26 hectares of land on your granite Dale Road 299 granite Bell Road so you can just see on the proposal plan they had the first plan there that 's on maximum those sheets there and that just shows the proposed subdivision so that you can see that it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a the Lots that are already I guess some separated by Granite Bay Road the land is situated in the rural zone and more specifically the mixed farming precinct so basically the subdivision just separates the land into the eastern and western portions there so basically there 's two independent uses that are already operating on the on the land so on the eastern portion that some contains a horse breeding facility and also training facility and on the western land portion there 's also a paintball arena that currently operates there and outdoor paintball arena so basically on councils playing assessment of the application I understand as recommendation for for a refusal citing non-compliances with the strategic framework the rural zone code and the reconfiguring a lot code I think also the bush fire hazard overlay code but really the crux and key issues there are the lots not achieving the minimum lot size of 40 hectares and the fragmentation of agricultural land as well so just to give a little bit of background as well you can see there that there 's also a land portion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 5 a that was previously subdivided from the apparent lot being the the lot that 's under this development application so that was approved in 2014 under the phony our 2003 start our planning scheme and really the assessment of that application dealt with the same issues that are being raised in in this application so the key issues being fragmentation and the minimum lot sizes which under the old scheme was the same 40 hectares we believe there are planning grounds and other relevant matters that were an approval of the of the proposed subdivision this is shown or I guess contextualized a little bit on the subdivision contacts map that 's also there as well so you can have a look at that that plan there and as you can see the land is already fragmented by granite Bell Road there are independent users already operating on the land there 's also the subject land is surrounded by an approved rural residential subdivisions being a mountain market estate also there are lots of long granite layer exact already presenters individual passes parcels of land and basically subdivided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of us as well so I guess there is a little bit of precedence there as well that some establishes that kind of um that kind of farm development parent happen along that stretch of road I think it 's also important to note that that the productive capacity and management of the of the land doesn 't necessarily change irrespective of the land being owned by by one person or two different people because essentially the land is fragmented by granite Bell Road and therefore each land parcel requires its own infrastructure servicing some security arrangements and and resource inputs for those for those pieces of land also there 's a similar subdivision proposal that was in um in Gympie as well and basically it was a very similar scenario to this which involved subdivision of land that has already fragmented by yeah and if T it was yeah yeah and that was basically a similar situation council offices had recommended for refusal and that development went to the learning environment court and the decision was changed to an approval on the basis that the court believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 402 fragmented so look they 're essentially the key arguments and planograms that we believe support approval of the of the application so yeah i 'm i just left son george also speak he 's a problem now so yeah wrap it up very sorry security essentially what we 're asking for council to do as Tom 's articulated is to consider this application and approve it subject to the usual conditions that would apply to rule land councils considering this now rather than its officers because it can add value to this assessment process and what we 're asking for respectfully is that common sense be applied to how this decisions made people say that town planning is really applied common sense which which sounds good and what we 'd be delighted to see happen is for council to think about this application in its context when we had discussions with officers about this it was suggested that this inquiry this type of inquiry is seen every fortnight for instance or every three weeks there 's a call that says that that is a scenario like this but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mount Meru Park residential development we 've got a piece of land that 's bisected by a formed Road the same formed road that bisected another piece that was sawed subdivide a lot of four years ago and fundamentally we don 't have a planning scheme it 's that different from we have another policy changed in the last four years that really justifies such a change in position I know that this difference in traffic but the reality is is that there 's enough traffic on graniteville road to make it very difficult for this property to be managed at one two key issues in this of fragmentation and lot size the fact that each piece of this block of land is operated independently of each other ones for paintball ones used for horses it 's a great indicator a lot those lot sizes are big enough to sustain their own independent uses it makes sense that they can be subdivided fragmentation that 's referred to thoroughly in your recommendation and it talks about further fragmentation it doesn 't talk about fragmentation from the start what we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a piece of land that 's got the road running down the middle whether it 's owned by one party or two it doesn 't change the level of fragmentation there and that 's really what we 're asking councillor to look at so we 're looking for an approval ideally subject to conditions that would normally be applied to a all subversion of his nature we 'll come back to this I want to go through the rest of the route the parts of the agenda and we 'll we will deal with this first up as part of the committee reports so before we continue I will ask that was the deputation thank you do we have notices of motion no presentations none I will do the meril minute and then we will live I 'll remove us but I before to be moved independently so the matter can be discussed okay so I 'll move through now to the meril minute fellow councillors I rise to speak about an issue around rates and insurance charts at my apologies through insurance charges the Australian Competition and Consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia insurance sector the inquiry is already documented the dramatically high cost of insurance here in northern Queensland it demonstrates that in northern Australia home and contents premiums have risen by a hundred and thirty percent over the last ten years compared to just 50 percent for the rest of Australia in the case of Townsville North Queensland the average home and content premium excluding GST and state levied stamp duties is almost double the average reported for the rest of Australia and as a result of these high levels Townsville North Queensland residents and businesses pay on average double the level of Taxation on insurance premium as that levied on the average Australian house council recently had the opportunity to contribute to this vital inquiry our submission recommends new compensation measures to offset the inequitable insurance costs in the north in lieu of any alternative proposals these could take the form of a significantly upgraded zonal tax offset in addition we are calling for the immediate state and federal reform so that GST and stamp duty is levied on the some insured rather than the premium paid this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pong like all residents most importantly Council continues to call on both the state and federal governments to take a far and more committed approach to the development of the north this means a real focus on regional equality and placemaking infrastructure investment including investment in natural disaster risk mitigation measures most importantly council continues to call on both the state and federal governments to take a fair a far more committed approach to developing the north finally council has expressed its desire to work with the a Triple C inquiry into into the future we believe that our shared experience during the this year 's unprecedented monsoon disaster can provide crucial Esch lessons for future insurance pricing and management indeed throughout our city 's recovery we have invested heavily in working with insurance providers and providing the best claims experience for residents and businesses alike we have accumulated considerable modeling and antidotal and analytical data closer study of this information in conjunction with the a Triple C has the potential to bear insights and how to improve damage mitigation and reduce prices the approach this approach has the express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monsoonal event we are continuing to work directly with insurers and the Insurance Council of Australia to ensure that local tradies are used whenever possible while we rebuild our community counselors are formerly table our submission to the northern Australian insurance inquiry and seek your endorsement to further develop relationships with the a Triple C se counselors I seek your formal support in that and I move that the arrow that our submission that has been given to the a Triple C be endorsed and to and I know many of you been working in the recovery process that we continue to formalize relationships with the Insurance Council in the a Triple C so I seek that support thank you all those in favor thank you we will now move to committee items and will I might move the Planning and Development Committee up and seek with the leave of the committee chair that we now discuss item or traditionally deputations are taken at committee and I note that you were invited to speak to committee but for some reason did not attend now I will formally ask our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to item 4 and if I could ask the thank you ever the acknowledgement as medical oddity but practical what was related today our state just it also the issues raised in the deputation hasn 't changed my client relations nation 's brightest today I mean happy if I refer captain 's back to castles always been consistent in relation to the as being two people in navigation together both times catharsis it was that that wants [Music] [Applause] it 's inconsistent with lots of coats out behind in Malaysia it will create friendship Oh to react versus with what runs that 's an example in every fashion as to be in prison that ding calluses and why only based on because the strategic planning those patients does the chair of committee have any further comment to make honest okay so I just have a question in terms of the strategic framework you note that the developer current application is already undersized and spatially fragmentation cannot be accepted as justification under the strategic framework the secretary see yeah other loss and I like that we 're under considerable pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more we save defragment the more there 's demand for further infrastructure I just can 't look at the questions of the counselor really sorry and this might be directed at mr. askin madam chair but the lots that have previously been subdivided that he mentioned set a precedent can he advise the Bates I 'm set under the old city plan of Sangha okay thank you thank you yes thank you we have some comments madam chair but because I agree with the comments by Mildred planning in regards to fragmentation because I agree that it 's no different from feelings and the current road already separates it so to me and I 've only been in the role just over three years but the proposals that I feel that we 've not back based on the planning back tonight you know I 'm gonna be reminded about that but I 've never seen one come in with a road that 's already got it split up anyway so I understand that each lot of where they have their own power and water so it 's it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a plan max but again common sense I just think that this decision and in regards to your comment for the rural roads the roads are already there I can 't see any more burden on making this I do agree with counsel that it is already fragmented I listened to what was explained to us and yeah I it is a common-sense thing for me I think that make diffic model with this happen about time too introduce the third piece so to be mindful wonderly table a second one in Bangkok I understand what the request is the next request would be whether critically the block from a heart agrees that people food so the only two different arguments are both creeps specialized to cut off rocks or but if you look at this block and its entirety and what we didn 't have is not what the intent is we were one not every doctor three this be mindful we signed up and then we have received the breath all that request we would retracted because we 're a block becomes this wall to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the intimacy that ends up at this one there 's not more being attentive the intended view the raw data counts societal outcomes that the end purchaser it 's the audit and as well what happened respect this is not going to be as journey through pain we should be mindful we 're gonna make time to call ahead with these blocks ah now I 've done the same water with Chris today but this is just a dumb outfit that we have to avoid so I just went close by saying that we have a number of blocks where I can think of one in couple in Woodstock where property owners have roads directly through the middle of them as well as various ones in your division counselor counselor Ida in fact a number of them while it might seem like it looks like the right thing to do I have to agree with counselor Walker 's summation that we 've already allowed one block off this now there 's a second and where will it end we and I keep reminding counselors that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line in the sand it 's been parked it was part of the reason why the state government amalgamated the two councils was to ensure that the planning scheme that we had an overall planning scheme that was functioning it supported our strategic framework when we placed our planning scheme it scheme for for government review and I 'm loathe to keep going back and and taking little bites saying oh it doesn 't apply to this and it doesn 't apply to that because we have to give landowners certainty not just the owners who come in but the owners around the properties that if they purchase that amenity that they purchase will remain that if they purchase 40 hectares that we 're not going to allow their neighbor to then subdivide in and around them all right councillors I will now put that to the vote council Jacob I said I would have the closing remark all right I wish to remind you so we have the recommendation that we support [Applause] the officers recommendation about Kanaskie now to go back to item four on your agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic framework secondly the rules own code thirdly the bush fire hazard overlay code fourth the reconfiguration lock code so that we support that and that the fact that they feel the applicant has not demonstrated that there are any other relevant matters that council could justify approval for this development despite the conflicts within the Townsville City Council plan and finally it is not considered that reasonable and relevant enforceable and final conditions can be imposed to remedy the non-compliance with the relevant assessment matters so I will put that allows someone to move that we accept the officers recommendation can have someone move Thank You council Walker seconded council array by I will put it to the vote all those in favor against so can I ask cancel a Jacob firstly for what are your planning reasons for not accepting the recommendation yes Maron for the chair I believe that the argument on that is already fragmented playing worried about the fact that council might have to answer a legal case [Music] where that under the act if you move against an officer 's recommendation particularly under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't think that we maintain any question and this is taking the way that the baby again is it about that you don 't agree I can only stress that the reasons you vote against a planning item is under the Act you must provide reasons and the reason should be about either based around the act of the relevant conditions noted but I would also like that have done why main reason is that the area in question is already fragmented and I don 't see anything wrong Thank You councillor Ryder as I distress when you deal with these matters it 's always advisable to look to quote whether or not you 're talking about reconfiguration and not just fragmentation so I 'll leave it at that I agree and as I said we didn 't invite mr. Luthor to speak at the planning meeting which would have given councillors more time all right Thank You counselors will now move on to the rest of the planning and development committee if I can cancel the meeting autumns bought two pipes reading discussion from the chair in physical firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the magnetic dolls at the magnetic island with trails and the draft vision playing a piece of great piece of work and it 's really exciting to actually see that come to fruition and I 'd like to thank drama queen keys and the staff involved and as I said a great body of work and I 'm sure that it will be well received not only by the Townsville community but from a tourism point of view as well thank you thank you thank you I have a mover and seconder for those

councillor we have to part of our mantra now is simpler faster better so I think this was a very good report all right any further comments from councils yes counselor daughter said in relation to utilizing evidence-based data to support the actions that this council takes it 's important every action you take is based on evidence and I think that is important for us to keep our light into the community in fact I believe part of the discussion was the GPS now we have on our garbage on our waste practices resulted in an inordinate amount of saving in terms of time and group designation thank

move we have two reports 28 and addendum 29 28 is part of opening Council so business services finance performance management report quarter CEO can I ask the Director of Business Service so just noting that report that we are showing constantly 70 positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does provide an update on the rain event obviously she 's represented Oh and television works for that period taste for the first website so Stacy just before you you sit down it 's probably worthwhile in this forum to to talk about at the moment the capital plan because I know from a budget perspective we are behind and elaborate on that for some of the councillors [Music] the Karabakh it was in support of the directors comments in effect after the rain event the quantum of capital program that a Dean impacted on was substantially higher than it currently sits we will have caught up all of that program by the end of June whilst at the same time haven 't delivered a substantive quantum of what is known as emergent works that came about as a result of the rain event itself the evaluation process that we 're going through at the moment in particular around disaster recovery funding arrangements as they 're established by the Commonwealth Government and supported by the state government is an issue that we 're awaiting confirmation of however it hasn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet all capital requirements by the 30th of June and in fact have completed all emergent works in preparation to move on to reconstruction which will take a considerable period of time so I commend the staff Madame mentor incredibly hard work considering what they the duties that they performed to support the city through the flood event itself and I know many of us recognize the the difficulty many of the staff from from the top right down to the very bottom have had as part of the process obviously with the rain event we 've seen emergent works that have required repair or restoration immediate restoration as well as the problems with business as usual so trying to run reconstruction in parallel with business as usual will be the next phase as we move through this process so there 's still a lot to do Thank You Stacy are there any other questions of staff or comments around the operational plan councillor doors have their own homes damaged during that time and so not only were they dealing with their own personal issues what many people within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city back on track so no means I don 't get like to congratulate staff for not only getting through the emergent works getting the city back on track but committing to having everything done by 30 Jen all right can I have someone move that the council received corporate performance report for quarter three 2018 and 19 being the period first of January to the 31st of March 2000 Thank You councillor Walker second it councillor qu being no further discussion I will put that to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you we have one item that is in confidential so if I can could have someone move that this report is in accord is in confidential in accordance with to Section 275 of the local government regulation 2012 as it relates to contracts proposed to be made by it so with that counselor Walker we move into confidential seconded councilor saws I will put that to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously could I please ask general business sorry counselor Jack yes second could I just a moment could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I 'd my apologies it 's got some great speakers from Queensland transport department from anime from the Sun Court from New South Wales transport and the reason why other like to do this because in our corporate plan we need a 2024 there are two items in each person a great leaders counselor and possibly speech that 's like to ensure the temple regional integrated transport plane rates index tensile terminal performance monitor Tech 's will claim to the temple transported bar or the really website today and historically the counselors will approve conference [Music] they 're being informal and we share that with all of us I think we have 23 just I want to check CEO are you sending anyone to this conference or do you see it with 4i I said confidences being worthwhile but it at this stage I 'm not sending in the offices of this conference aware that there 's a couple of presenters that are in fact one of them is a part of this take up the head of the Department of Transport and another one is the Deputy Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic transport in New South Wales click out the batteries their colleague of mine so my intention for the offices point views the deal but I saved the reasoning behind councillor Jacobs counselor there is often conferences through the LGI queue that are just as informative and far cheaper have you considered one of those we all received being you are we it yes but I saw that you know is a an opportunity to as a counselor gain more information or transport to Townsville look it was one I must admit I put in the delete bin but if the council is happy to support you on this are you moving to take a leave of absence I am here from the forth until the so the second until the fourth of September we please note that leave of absence right and we 'll move to accept I would have preferred this to have gone through our traditional process Council which is through committee for discussion is there any reason why this character couldn 't have gone through the committee process yes madam Here I am we all only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for any of the committee 's last time because I was on 3 May previously the reason another reason why I wanted to go through is because there is a super early bird feed for this particular conference and it differs by about 500 if we do it later self we put it through the cutoff date to the early bird is the 10th of June second question through the tip what is the cost is five okay the cost for the early bird is 2595 that involves the two-day main form on one-day post forum site to us of all the different facilities in Sydney you know they 're implementing some of these programs in transport there is a two-day main forum which is 1995 in the early in the super early bird I chose the letter B because I would like to see the innovation that is going in the city and also but there is a lot of innovation in Sydney and you know the driverless trains and all these sort of things happening and I would like to stay abreast of all that information sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was like Sierra he actually chairs out infrastructure community who would probably will normally be a better fit with this particular one I 'm just wondering if he has the opportunity as well or whether we consider an or situation we really do have to do with the council to do so through the chair could we just not approve a council to attend and discuss I 'm in Council Racing valid points in terms of attending leads counselor has an opportunity to education development of the city just think the Greeks irrelevant conference so it should be okay so but counselor Jacob is seeking leave of council to attend a conference in council support for the payment of the fees and I would imagine all associated travelled to and from the conference that is the motion all right I think we just deal with that all right so are you moving there councillor Jacob right counter seconded by councillor Walker all those in favor and granting leave for councillor Jacob to attend this conference and all payments associated please raise their hand all those against carried thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not I 'll close the meeting at 30 or thank you all for your attendance","(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

Australia",1557,I 'm Ross Manning Brisbane based artist and here we are in my studio in yunga in a previous life I was a service technician repairing electronics like electronic whiteboards and TVs and data projectors and it was working with these machines that sort of first got me interested in the electronic image how it 's made and it 's kind of agency and also the skills to kind of recreate it or regenerate what 's happening within the machine the Institute of Modern Art invited me to put together a show that oversees last 10 years of my practice it 's called dissonant and rhythms the title distant rhythms kind of has this overarching theme throughout the show where everything 's turning or having their own sort of enclosed system of loops or oscillation and that 's either visual or sonic within the show there 's six works the earliest one is from 2009 and then I 've had a new commission as well for the show 2017 I 'm really interested in energy and and there 's this sort of loop of energy within each of the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recycling of that energy it said that there 's no more or less energy in a system it just changes forms so within each one of these artworks you can sort of see that play out wav opus 1 2 3 all stem from a live instrument building practice that I 've been doing for about almost 15 years now and the core of that is the two motors with a rope attached and as the motors spin it creates a wave form in the rope I used the kind of energies and the centrifugal force within this wave form as a percussive activator so I placed different tuned percussion instruments of my own making similar to this in its path and as the string interacts with the different objects that 's this sort of chance composition it comes about so within the wave opus series I 've used a variety of different percussive objects some tuned percussion like aluminium such as way of opus three or maybe even some traditional instruments like vibra phones I 've taken the chat there are keys out of that and use the spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then also non-traditional and self built percussive instruments like these behind me so each one we 've got steel nails and wire and some metal strapping from containers and each one gives your own kind of texture and timbre to it so is it a continuation on the wave opus series of works the IMA commissioned a new wave opus wave opus three that was shown in dissonant rhythms it 's the largest one scale wise that I 've made to date and this one was slightly different it took up its three curtains of made up of hanging aluminium chime sixty chimes each and I 've used DMX programming to switch these ropes the spinning ropes that activate them on and off in a kind of sequence that happens every 15 minutes oh it was important to me with this work to have it as a singular idea in this in this quite large space that the IMA has it has concrete ceilings and floors and I really wanted to use the space itself is a kind of resonator for the instrument I wanted also the this room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was some custom-made seats built to view the work but also as a secondary platform for events and musical performances and lectures that happened over the course of the show when the the sculptures activating that 's 180 different notes playing at the same time so from a distance it becomes this kind of diffuse cloud of sound one big thing but I was encouraging people to walk through and next to the chimes and put their ear close to kind of determine their own [Music] determine their own experience of the composition but during the lead-up to the show I did some recording of these instruments that are in the same group as WAV opus and these recordings have been compiled onto an LP that 's called reflex and waves which is a companion piece to the catalogue spectra is a series of works that I 've been making since 2012 for dissonant rhythms it 's number 13 I made it particularly for the space at the Institute of Modern Art the work has a suspended series of beams one end is a fan at the other end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans spin and oscillate they send each beam into orbit and as the as the colored light moves in the space they mix together in different ratios and that color mixing you can see on the gallery walls is the temperatures and hues change so it it relies on RGB color mixing red green and blue the primary colors mix together you can get all the colors of the spectrum so six short films that was commissioned by the len lye center and Gullett brewster art gallery in new zealand in 2016 and this work uses the mechanics of film based around blend lies early film experiments and hand produced coloration of film and direct film techniques that he pioneered and it involves six overhead projectors and I 've made a conveyor system which moves a strip of theater color theater gel that I 've cut up and collage myself over the body of the overhead projector so that projects into the corner of the space bricks and blocks uses a video camera and a screen to create its imagery there 's a video camera on the mirror and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown on the screen and it and it creates its own imagery that way as this kind of Tolu endless sheet is from 2011 it also uses overhead projectors with a conveyor belt much like six short films but this one uses brown paper as the conveyor belt with holes punched in it and as the paper moves the light from the projectors passes through as the two holes align and this then is projected up onto the wall as a kind of animation the ideas behind this is to do with kind of an animation of coding and code all electronic images are pretty much code that you that you can 't see but make the TV operate or the projector operate so I wanted to get cracked this down into it will reduce it down into its basic form so using the the the hole punches is like on and off or 1 or 0 and that kind of binary idea and using that as the raw material for this animation so piano lor is a player piano which is an early automated instrument that uses brown paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the oldest work in the show from 2009 this piece uses the heart of data projectors as its image generator is so to speak so I 've taken these glass prisms that come from the optical matrix inside LCD data projectors and this is where you get the red green and blue information and it mixes together and spits out a full-color image so it 's sort of the heart of the electronic image where everything happens so first extracted those out of the Machine and laid them bare on a circular table there 's a l-little LED white light that 's attached to sails that are that are driven by an oscillating fan and this light bumps its way around a circumference of the two prisms projecting beams of colored light across the circle the projectors that I 've taken these prisons from have a nice history to them they 're from art galleries and I have this kind of poetic idea that all the artwork that was shown through these machines of the color the particular color palette is still trapped within these little blocks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to sad magic in a way it uses dichroic filters as the name suggests these are found inside data projectors as well and they used to manipulate the light and filter out various colors and and it 's they 're used to create the image so what I 've done is I 've got data projectors that that use these filters to create the image and then as its projected out I 've got filters outside that then take apart so it 's like an assembly of the image and then are taking apart again each work has its own closed system of energy and they all operate within this kind of their own logic in a way without the human presence so they 're relying on on different kind of physical the physicality of the object whether it 's balanced or levered or spinning or moving or you know projecting color [Applause] [Applause] you you,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

blue and community first approach really encourages in point happening and the menopause I 'd like to believe longevity about cultural change for about educating the populace we 're about readmitted helped out into the open and ensuring that it doesn 't sleep as and that educating all that cultural change and now so we see the long-term project everyone a lot or in support of what that is to say as the chair of the human and social the proper group we have piggies in it people have reached out to receive something special support as a result of the event so I think that 's an people Cobb 's

that 's just wrong and child to prevent disease what will you don 't do very well is to understand is something we need to do a grassroots level we say the literally hundreds of millions it doesn 't seem to imagine the progress we need and maybe just might selection period what bringing the staff to the community we can stop the discussion about looking at see if we can get some further funding and say take back those two and a half times the national it is it breaks my heart to say that never and this is why I 've been to want the council to be involved we 're not just spare Rhodes rights

team were together there and before my house mentioned some statistics around the flood vise collection is for example looking at a total cost to the right pair about 2.9 million dollars in their total of about 20,000 many hours of going into the processing in their place and obviously that 's that 's guess force their hand to accelerated meself yeah um as far as TCC assets things like our local roads we found about two three thousand six hundred pieces of damage pony rides and we were still seeing that happening at the moment you know and that equates to get 255 kilometers of damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this flood event so what are the guys in Waco furiously on that we get intense pain throughout to get those things repaired with compost and that the my mother patchy it was the wasn 't about will move into that repeat life very very sweet pathways are in the city thirty four corners pathway needed to be clean we had down excessive amounts of silt and the rest of it depositors especially around the river I 'm good thing is that that silk is something we can waste movie is that any toxic it 's a great rally how come they 're pulling some points around the place I know let 's group and lastly the Civic Theatre for example obviously sustained some sufficient extensive get damage there we started work on that February the good thing is that the festival chamber

be implemented in the wake of the techno industrial revolution where AI computers and we 're products intended in the near that existing drugs they need to further lesson unemployment in summary raising these start by setting the five dollars a week with at least an applicant any more choices access better food and perhaps take up some money for repairs to their vehicle may occur insurance

eat some stress and anxiety and hope to keep people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethically and morally right thing to do in a modern civilized society we have no notices of motion there is no presentations and now proceed to Maryland in its counselors my fellow counselors he heard presentation today from someone who is who is on new start and that the Australian Local Government Association Assembly last year the following motion in his pants in light of the burden placed on local governments across Australia to respond to the needs and challenges of people living in poverty and homelessness the National General Assembly calls on the federal government to raise the Newstart allowance to the level of the Henderson poverty line to increase the well-being and life chances of many of many in our community thousands of people in towns will see we 've got inadequate Social Security payments but leave them struggling to afford the basic supplies like food housing and clothing these payments trap people in poverty making it even harder for us to look for a job keep a roof over their head and participate in our community in the report published last year Deloitte Access Economics found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty five million into the Townsville economy in its first year councillor councillors a lot of what you 've heard today personal story but also the large number of people in our community living on Social Security payments that are well below the poverty line and to support the a jiae 's advocacy campaign I seek your endorsement the Townsville City Council to call on the Australian Government to raise the rate of new style and youth allowance and other allowances both ways that we pop dollars a week to improve the well-being and life chances in many about community now I have a seconder for that thank you counselors are there any further comments from councillors all right I 'll put back to the vote all those in favor against marriage and Emily I have one other mailing minute passes and many of you aware of this one as well the Local Government Association insert with the support of the local sorry my apologies the Australian Local Government Association with the support of the local government association of Queensland has launched its 2019 federal election advocacy campaign the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the financial assistance grants to at least 1% of total Commonwealth taxation revenue the Australian Local Government Association has endorsed the restoration of things financial assistance to at least one person it as its focus to leverage the advocacy campaign the LGA Q is seeking the formal backing of all Queensland councils local councils just raise just 3% of all taxation revenue in Australia but manage more than 33% of public assets the federal government collects 80% of taxes and manages around a percent of public assets while the provision of the federal assistance grants is welcome the decline in local government share of Taxation revenue from Canberra over the past two decades has moved from 1% in 1996 to 0.55 percent in 2018 and this ladies and gentlemen is unsustainable the LGA Q is calling for Canberra to return this money to local communities faster and in a better way in an in a way that better meets the local needs and creates jobs the success of the state governments works for Queensland program which offered Untied funding to councils to deliver essential community projects and infrastructure while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the how restored financial assistance grants could work for all Queensland communities Queensland currently receives a make of 480 million dollars a year in financial assistance grants with only two point fulfilling being distributed nationally restorations of these grants to 1% would mean an additional 100 million dollars for queen 's own discussions on the restoration of financial assistance grants occurred at the La LNG a cubes Rock Assembly on the 7th of February with senator Bridget McKenzie the then Minister for regional services sports local government and decentralization and Steven James NPS Shadow Minister for regional services territories and local government the LGA Q president has also held meetings in camber on the 12th of February with the Deputy Prime Minister and advisors to the prime minister treasurer and leader of the Opposition councillors to formally back the LGA Q 's advocacy campaign I seek your endorsement of for the following firstly the council expresses its appreciation to the government for the ongoing permission of the financial assistance transformative approaches second that council endorses restoration of the value of the financial assistance grants to 1% of the total Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports the LGA accused advocacy through a community driven campaign to federal representatives and candidates on the benefits of the restoration of financial assistance grants counselors on I support and move those three points thank you do I have a seconder Thank You council approve any discussions on that yes counselor Jacob army yes no my team and I both really support that around a bit time as I pointed out isn 't raining the other day it would be good if the local government and councils were recognized in the Constitution because that would give extra inputs into the one percent because they are not currently recognized in that Constitution it 's not going to makes any kind of getting the money out of the federal government but we were recognized then we could put into place hitting that one percent all the time so is it possible for people to go to their representatives and see whether that can come up as a referendum ah counselor at the moment there is no mood to go back to the people with a referendum for local government there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we were recognized under the Constitution so the origin of the federal assistant grants dates back to God Brooklyn days and for many years was maintained at about 1% of Taxation revenue until 1996 and we 've seen a steady decline since then so you 're well aware that the pressures of financials sustained ability acquired some prominent for local governments this would go a long way not just helping this local council but think about those at it hundun Julia Creek pond curry where they 're seeing declining revenues because of declining populations this would go a long way to ensuring financial sustainability for many of those local authorities any other so I 've moved in seconder I 'll put back to the Bible those who favor against carried unanimously thank you CEO we will now move to because of the crowd in the gallery this I think that we need to do this before we move through to the committee reports and I 'll ask this the staff if we can deal with the first one which will be the motorsport and driver education facility page 107 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please thank you madam in 126 of five that 's what gender refers to a tube champion piece application that councillors received to stablish a motorsport in driver education facility at 120 V Dewey Road the land is Castle Island and versus the application self comprises several ones the first thing as circuit racing drag racing a burnout pad Ostrow rally racing remote-control car racing go-cart racing its inducers that each of these will have their own specific track envisage this part of the cycle of the series of driver training facility as well and as part of the applications of this proposer have a number of larger events associated with the drivability the application was publicly notified and during that period we received admissions importance for the application and n6 objecting to the proposal the issues raised during proposal were very they include the rule and empty-ass cooperation noise habitat for the black rope pro to treat each safety issues property valuations in the area and intensity an impact occurred the use on property valuations traffic issues roads and any condition those roads fencing and international might absolute joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location so the application is referred to so for comment they can take they come back with several issues mainly related to access of the site in our people of the intersection treatment with this island and in particular the proximity of the railroad crossing and one of the patient that might have three discussions with the EMR and through the opponent proposed that the facility be accessed off of the track leading out to the counter close to the intersection of the woods off the road within this highway as part of the further discussions with siren through TMR is proposed to stage of development and that 's reliant on the the scale of people at any and use either site so stage three comprises of a maximum of 75 vehicles per hour using the site Stage two is just some law at the 250 is very last part of stage 2 that they required to provide a rail crossing a photo of glassy and stage three is a preliminary approval which you 'll see a new intersection being adult and the full use of the post development officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the objectives and by the supporters of åland they 're recommending approval subject to conditions and its capacitance attraction I really need questions regarding these applications to stun it 's quite a detailed report each of these meters had their submission is dealt with individually [Applause] are there any further comments yes my mother 's side of the family my family made not involved in state way through transmitters and it 's fantastic to say facilitate moving a step closer to actuality in grateful and development I would easily at the same way and from the school slightly in Council so I started to say to favor and I mean two children drive through learner driving at the moment I think that facility is my mind you here as well so what this idea there 's many in the community could be very supportive of this right any other comments if not all the hoodie to the vote all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you everyone the next item we will deal with is item 20 [Applause] [Music] [Applause] autumn 25 the material change of use again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered at the planning on committee effect the clothes every but decision was to refer to council determination the mutual exchange of views application is book have a holiday yard it 's located at stepping the little Heath Heath Road and 800 foot and had her mobility clues highlights properly 74 was out of town adjacent existing reading in pepper industry area just off highway then the land is currently zoned rule Roosevelt consists of various items they included 18 Cabot holding yards four pins a site office catapult handling facilities I think so storage shed a storage Basin and an ethyl and plunger and I believe detachment one of the council report identified at the site plan or it could actually outlines how helps its on-site the application of a free bar Council of at five for 15,000 have a cabin at any one time however within their plan importance of or their planning report is identified that at any one time to think is adjusting to the 5,000 head and the estimated earnings for equal of the facility was religious to be some Europe and head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received 64 submissions one for and 63 against the issues raised during pollination period there 's quite a few clients they included water quality water quantity odor noise dust hair concerns with the impact of the effluent or the operation the airplane holding pond health impacts environmental impacts traffic impacts and economic impacts through the process gas loss is engaged consultant or peer review of the technical reports the recommendations that can happily appear will be recommended for that still some data gaps and some concerns and that further investigation of the studies need to be undertaken and recommend is that it counsel with approval and we should be subject to various conditions to mitigate the impacts of development officers have taken forward the recommendation from peer review they considered the issues raised during the public notification period at 00 in the report and they are recommending approval for the cattle holding facility however not for the 15 thousand head of cattle identified in the application but limited to a maximum four and a half thousand if Academy only and still subject to a variety of conditions which relate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised by the peer review the report is headed for consideration Thank You counselors another view who have gone through this report as I have and I 've raised some concerns with the staff we have a report here that seeks to approve the quest to approve the officers recommendation however I won 't be supporting the officers recommendation I 'm looking to reduce the separation so of us the counselors does anyone wish to know the officers recommendation so then I would assume that counsels decision is to refuse this application do I have support for that so reasons for refusal would be and we have done yet and interesting presentations at committee and I think both sides for for their presentations however the proposed amount of development should be refused as a completes with the strategic framework work rule of zone code and overlay codes for the Townsville City Planning the subject site cannot accommodate a development of the scale proposed as the land area is not large enough to mitigate the adverse impacts on the environment and in the adjoining community this use should be located on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed and larger buffer areas can be maintained the technical reports submitted by the applicant in relation to water quality water supply storm water quality over noise and dust do not adequately adequately address the impacts on the environment and the amenity impacts on the surrounding community in particular there are there will be significant impacts on the surrounding community in relation to noise dust and odor as a consequence of this development and it is to these reasons I will refuse this development oh no that 's what I will be tabeling to the minute clock are there any others who used to table reasons for refusing I would post any previous applications to confirm yourself I do not believe it 's an appropriate location due to its boxing the prisoners make me extremely unlikely that does odor and Morrissey can be managed effectively further on consumer frequent this small staff had a folding knife with me impediment to development about legislating some more difficult vegetation also claim us the Waterpik news analyst at one campus unfortunately more personal thing as I 've been doing some research predominant we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southwesterly direction so opinion that we the noise is another issue that with actually we that he talked about minimizing the report many wasn 't fine works but then you guys want to say that when the sheep 's you and they 're gonna begin a 24-hour Corrections sort of doesn 't next one I don 't know but issues rather than what you see with a nice man yes anyhow this counselor jacqueline canceled Thank You Madame Aaron through the chair of the 64 submissions from the public 63 were against the cattle holding hands at Oak Valley the residents main concern against material change the users wherever order quality quantity odor effluent holding coins noise dust health impacts traffic impacts economic impacts all these concerns are still relevant even though the original proposal has been scaled back by the council offices to four thousand five hundred head of cattle instead of the 15,000 that was originally proposed one of the submitters identified that their family had grown up on cattle stations and they state that even a muster of 300-400 cattle in yards before transport identified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention the noise and he states that cattle our extra vocal after transport and the stress that they have enjoyed on the journey he also says with strong breezes making the odors that will be blowing through the valley I believe the health issue is very relevant also to the material change abuse of the residents to fever has been identified by the submitters and I believe not enough thought has been given to possible outcomes within the report I also believe that this material change abuse for real residential area only 17 kilometres from the CBD I will always support the residents in this city when they have genuine concerns and show that concern when it is well presented in submissions that are documented grounds of facts and circumstances anyone else opposed to go because I component over weights actually council play the size of subject of the side is a concern and again has been public confidence and authority raised the issues of dust noise and odor I have not seen anything that to me doesn 't rest well with me in terms of questions and simulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am as I feel like this the person I won 't be suited to notice audience quite succeed but presidential times from businesses by some appalling concern the bullets the decline worth it up lockers erected in there 's something sort I 'm gonna comment I to the government will Scott opponents of the land area because loud enough to go get those impacts environmentally and offensive start up the program should be like that in a lot of the rural land would need XP didn 't manage a lot of up areas can be committed with regards we were other noise and that 's report submitted by African relating directly to odor noise and dust we 're not adequately address the impacts on the environment and the amenity impacts upon ceramic community both residential and business we 're not believe that the noise about all others will stop at the boundaries that repeated and invariably performance and wind direction as counsel more community started to be critical factors for residents and business many thanks madam any so regarding item 20 popper which Cervantes waters recommendation for the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports are inconclusive in their ability to demonstrate no impacts on adjoining topics we believe its perspective over concerns raised while community does what this point through with respect to the concern about up the report states Otis will still emanate from therefore upon further again other control of the over lives upon the airport we lived for my drive across New York yeah also there 's no consideration has been given to wet weather events which would prevent crust from forming which would thus close and over problems given the recent event in our city of course I 've concerns about how this issue was managed and they 've not been aggressive in support all right councillors any others before I remove that breed refuses actually based on the statement of reasons provided on this subject he said I think they 're a better location further like areas I think counsel we don 't know anything on that there 's no doubt that there are operations already in the city that are but that are doing this work and we 're not receiving necessarily the point about odor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right counselors so I removed that we refuse this application do I have a seconder Thank You counsel I 'll put a based around the statement of reasons we put

stories,yXHZIkq2GOo,20171016,662.419,"Townsville QLD 4810, Australia",1781,a good picture book you can never know what 's going to happen when you turn the page and that 's the case with Derek or wombat if you hold it up to kids and say okay what do you think happens on the next page they can never guess what is going to happen even though in fact for half the book the wombat just eats grapes and scratches they can never get and that 's one of the most important lessons to go in when you 're writing it 's to break the narrative imperative narrative imperative is when you 're watching a detective story and middle-aged woman is taking up with over walking trips a cop in the morning beautiful morning mrs. rising from the lake what 's going to happen sure you will discover a body young policeman they 're about to investigate a strange noise in the airway and he says oh yes and along the baby is due in three days time and then the venn I 'm actually going to retire from the police force and take up my uncle 's always fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm within 20 seconds its narrative imperative a good book you could never ever guess what is going to happen you want against you do this and hopefully that is the case with misgiving with miss Lily 's lovely babies I haven 't found anyone who was actually guessed the secret at the end of that book phase you who was up on stage speaking and she got into stories about what happened in her childhood and what over the back fence the book she was providing was all about and you know I was they 're supposed to be taking photos on the day and I just found myself just listening and you know really paying attention and it really drew me in and I think that 's that 's part of a good storytelling as well you know people just are in the moment so I loved history and finding out about my own people I didn 't know the truth about finding out the truth and hearing our stories from from our people so it 's about us telling passing those stories on to our generations because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about talking about now we can put it into walk into word the audience comes in and sits in the palms of your hands it just sits there and it doesn 't breathe hardly and it cries and it laughs and enjoying things and it smiles and our hearts unite as one group and it 's heaven storytelling is so it 's so felt in here within your inmost being and when you bring out that story and that it 's like it becomes on my life and it makes people see things they see it on live they can see it before their own toys when you start to talk in a way of storytelling to them they think yeah I can see it I can see what you 're saying the thing I love most about storytelling is that it gives you a point of connection I think with the lives of those whose stories you tell me I mean it 's I think an Express an expression of a kind of common humanity in some ways that that act of storytelling and and also the connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind when I 'm telling a story and I think of it as in some ways a bit like telling a joke a joke is a kind of story and we all know that we 've told a joke that 's fallen flat and we know if we tell the joke that people like you can always tell a means I think and it 's such so it is with the story that that I 'm always thinking about how I can connect with the audience and how I and you know communicate and convey that the the the complexities of a particular experience in the past to that audience in terms that that audience will understand because everything we do as writers is in the present you know it 's it 's we 're always dealing with a really existing audience in the present and if we misfire we failed as writers we failed as historians in my case and we failed the storytellers so it 's it 's the point of connection with the past and also with the audience in the present but I enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us just could give in this box to research anything you want to not specifically for a book I never actually specifically research a book if I did I know I wouldn 't know enough to actually write that book but knowing that I can follow any of the wonderful clues of detective stories in history to find out what really happened to be able to do that to write picture books with actually a team with the illustrator of the two editors and if it keeps on saying we can 't make anyone know how much fun we have doing by the way we have got the sequences are everyone back the 6 a one-bed but that 's only going to be released possible some storytellers like thomas hardy the branches in modern translation they tell you story about ordinary people in ordinary circumstances pulled around by by the internal forces or external forces most good stories and about people there 's a series it 's available at this library called called the Midwife and the little stories that they told you and excellently done because there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to an old man that was on the Sun and he 'd been to see some of these films he made about them and he said that if we behave like that in almost 5 minutes you didn 't last five minutes anywhere if you don 't look it but if you jumped around that fed is right there did just and he walked out talking about Superman isn 't all right for their dream but it really is done I think in terms of safe photography and storytelling being able to let the work speak for itself so I know a lot of galleries and exhibitions they ask you to put an artist statement or a comment about the photograph beside it to explain it but I think photos shouldn 't have to do that so they should be able to tell a story or invoke an emotion or you know capture the spirit of a place or time or event or person without words so yeah and I like to try and do that in my photography but it can be quite challenging I used to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had read every single book that they had in the shelf and we 'd read them four or five times really didn 't feel like reading the same story over and over so I used to just lie down beside them and tell the story well it 's just part of life isn 't it story telling you tells stories to to your babies and about the world and they learn through it and you get told stories from your parents and the friends and we pass on stories and and now we 've got social media and everybody 's sharing stories around the world and at least once a day I get a snapchat of my grandkids one of my grandkids doing something like last night I had been with a Marone cowboy shirt with a cape I was running around the place with his cape you know we 'd had nothing to do with the Cowboys he 's only 2 I also grew up in a community minded and like most of us our grandparents often you know told us really good stories and and as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am and I like to pass that on to the next generation of the people around me because often like some people order we do read a lot or like in our society you know the Western society there 's so much information but we tend to just read it and not sharing it yeah so a thing is storytelling is about sharing the more we share is the better the story and then being able to pass it on to the next generation well history is stories isn 't it that 's what it is it 's a story people 's stories achievements and you can focus on one area that one theme stories about people who conquered the world stories about people who lived in everyday life I love it because I love adventure I like learning new things I like hearing about different ways of doing things and people 's different experiences it 's interesting to me how people lived in the past compared to how they live now and and what they went through and what their experiences were it just interests me with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the Isle of Wight and was on the prison holds and then came to Australia and lived in New South Wales and you just think about what he felt like when his feet were on on that boat and they were leaving Portsmouth on Christmas Eve and he lived in a place like the world of the Isle of Wight and he can 't and they came to Australian easily you just can 't imagine how they dealt with everyday life it 's just interesting to put myself into somebody else 's position and sort of feel try to imagine how they would have felt the idea that you 're telling a story and that it 's the story that is holding them and that you 've got rapt attention and every little nuance of the story you can impede it on their basis and it 's if you 're doing it really well you 've certainly put it a lot into it but you know that it 's the story that is holding their attention rather than yourself [Music],"(-19.2589635,

outside just because they 're there toilet and shower isn 't accessible mum always said that if she died tomorrow what am I going to do so instead of saying oh well I 'm in a nursing home or home for disabled kids I said I 'll have to be independent but try and find a house here in Townsville that 's equipped for a wheelchair is nearer to impossible my wife and I were looking for a rental place in the last month we 've actually gone to 15 houses and you none of them have been successful we did go to a home on the weekend and we just felt that the steps there was about 14 steps and I was didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway through it took us a long time to find out that was even remotely suitable for my requirement wider hallways and doorways no steps to get into the home all those sorts of things are extremely difficult when silver-level hareton are being built my son Lockheed lovely Lachlan he was born with special needs it was a godsend when we got a chair that enabled just the simplest thing of locky sitting at the dining room table with us but they were trying to get the chair in any other room or or down the hallway and around the corner we couldn 't do it we got planes done up to raise the house to build in under so that we could all leave the kitchen everything all of our living spaces and Lakis room and bathroom be downstairs and that was going to double a mortgage when you think about the costs that a genuine cost there to retrofit a home down the track to make it more accessible to the basic level it costs a lot more to do it then makes sense financially to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home designed to this level is far greater than what you get from traditional homes and it 's not just those people with disabilities but it 's those people

year old son into care the young boys I guess was quite excited about some independence he was about to get not knowing what his mum and dad have been through their whole life to give him that strength and confidence within his ability at the time and the parents doing it knowing that they 're not going to be around forever that was the first introduction for mean a disability sector and I 've brought that into my standard building practices I 've just done because again there 's not a super person able bodied or specially disabled who who has ever ever said no I don 't want that in my home now I can see a day where in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot better than what home that isn 't up to its alpha level standard does because that 's what the community will meet whether you 're in a

know one entry point into the house with no steps minimum one metre wide hallways 870 Millwood doorway step free shower 1.2 meters in front of a toilet from the door and importantly behind the walls in the bathroom and toilet structural Timbers purple on the walls future burbles it 's just made perfect sense when I saw the standards in the and how simply whole dynamics of families lives can be

or another the cost of the silver level players in between two and three thousand dollars per house at the initial construction stage is going to be good because you 're broadening your market

AUS,QLD,Townsville City Council,Townsville City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaTIMjVP_MxBFaq1B4AYk9A,Conversations at the library - What's your favourite story,ULcNUNmTlRA,20171016,445.109,"Townsville QLD 4810, Australia",1145,I still remember quite vividly the first time I read Tolkien 's The Hobbit classic book I 've got several editions now and and that 's sort of one of my go-to is when I was in my adolescence I read it for the first time and it 's one I 've been back to read several times because it 's just a fascinating tale that you know it 's really engaging so I think yeah those are the things that are important there 's a book I absolutely adore and when I 've written a book myself I always say to myself now is this book that I have written as good as this one which I love and the book that I 'm talking about is a book called owl babies by Martin Waddell it is heaven it 's so exciting it 's so short it 's so dramatic it 's so heart stopping the characters are so funny and so fantastic and the ending is so marvelous that you think oh I want to do that our babies by Martin Widow my favorite story is usually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also or the one before it because if it 's really bad it 's not the one that I 'm reading at the moment and also a book that perhaps moved me along in my thoughts of my understanding of life a little bit one that I really if I read it now it doesn 't mean so much to me but when I first read it a Room of One 's Own by Virginia Woolf I really opened up to me the thought that back in the day women didn 't have the opportunity to live the lives that we live now and she was saying that all women needed was 500 pounds in a room of their own and they then they could be themselves and and so that would have to be my favorite book because it made me think Oh what do I want to do and what do I need to do to get to be able to what do I need to be able to do what I want to do not as mother daughter sister do you know what I mean as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation between like my mother 's generation where there was no opportunity whatsoever unless she was completely driven or one-of-a-kind for her to make a life for herself within a marriage do you know what I mean where is my generation I think a lot of people were starting to go oh yeah did this got married had the kids and what now yeah my favorite story you know certainly in Australian history and fiction would be Henry Handel Richardson 's the fortunes of Richard Marnie which is a huge triple-decker novel written well that the early part of the 20th century and it 's a story of a man a doctor an Irish doctor who comes to the Victorian gold fields but is never at home and so that 's very much an immigrant story it 's very powerful it 's but it 's so powerful that the first time I read it I felt depressed actually at the end of it all because it 's a very sad story of a man who eventually loses his mind but it 's I think one of the great stories that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many historians although it 's not of history it 's based Richardson or if Robertson she was based it on her her father 's letters the letters between her father and mother so it 's very much based on her family history but it 's not a family history it 's very much a novel it 's a modernist novel certainly by the time we get towards the end the last of the trilogy was written but in the 1920s and so she 's influenced by I guess the whole stream-of-consciousness thing by that stage and it 's an immensely powerful story about you know it is about colonial Australia but I think more generally just about the human I remember the last time and I was terrified and I suddenly realized look I 'm only have another few minutes or even 30 seconds I 'm not going to waste the last few minutes of my life just being scared and I said you 're pretty he went back to the most beautiful the most meaningful moments and I just read you I am lucky at that well I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those moments and so look I think those are my favorite stories the sequel to mysteries of the ages the the heroine is actually waiting for the result of an operation and incredible and of course it was it was word-for-word what it was like waiting for my husband for the night nine hour operation it comes from somewhere so my favorite stories the moments the moments of just my favorite story my favorite story because I was brought up in in a Christian environment my grandparents we would always have biblical stories that we would love to read and I always loved the story of Queen s not that she was she would come into the kingdom for such a time is to be there for her people and I feel that me as a modern-day Queen Esther a modern day I feel that I am right here meant to be here to represent the Aboriginal dattara straight and Australian South Sea under today I love autobiographies I love autobiographies I love reading other about other people 's you know lives and especially you know like because there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting lives I love reading the history because our people have written their stories about their lives about what happened to them you know through from colonization to where we are today and inspiring stories about you know the struggle of about our education is the key that that opened doors for us as I encourage our young people you know like to talk to young people about education there 's a story every yo-yo that I 've told countless times which I heard and adapt and from each season so I heard a tone up concept you know and then like 20 years later I was presenting at myself and I think that kind of symbolizes how powerful the story was I mean it involves some singing in music and and engagement on it but the fun that 's involved and unpacking there [Music],"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

you",26hRjH_NoSs,20171016,498.93,"Townsville QLD 4810, Australia",1297,I 'll look at myself with the kind of a DIY mentality so I like to do as much as I can myself in life so whether that 's you know fixing things that are broken at home or you know roasting my own coffee beans for example or you know even with my photography rather than just snapping a digital camera I like to do the traditional process with film and develop the film and make the prints and and do all that so I like to take that longer path and some people might say yeah but you know it takes you so much longer to do a particular thing but you get so much more enjoyment out of the process than you do out of just getting the result and I think a lot of people miss that these days they 're always after that instant gratification but yeah I think life 's more about the journey rather than the destination because if we focus on that then we 'll all be just dead right my journey through my life and I 've come through so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of I think all the the tragedies and all the stuff in my life that I 've been through has made me fight even more harder to better myself and to you know so that I don 't wallow in India know the the past I just got to think about the future and have you know too violent cuz I want something better for my life so I wanted something better and my one of my wishes you know used to dream about it was owning a brand-new car and I 've driven two brand-new cars off the showroom floor because of that and I 'd love to own my own home and down the track maybe you know this book may be the start because I 'd love to turn it into a movie what makes me me you know what makes me me really probably my mum and dad and they 're dead but the way I was just thinking about them today I was just thinking about the energy level I was just thinking about the fight for social justice about caring for the world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic they were just fantastic and I think they made me work hard they made me believe in myself and I was very very lucky and I have a gorgeous second family you know and husband who absolutely believes in me grandson who loves me a daughter who thinks on the a1 mum you know it 's nice it 's I think family makes you my culture my identity my existence of just being Who I am and why I am today and I have a tattoo that I created and it 's the four little dots is my grandparents my moral beliefs my family and friends and my workmates all them make who I am and that is my protector and he 's always walking forward so I 'm saying what makes me me is that without them I wouldn 't be Who I am today so that 's what makes me me you get your belief systems you get your ways of doing things from your family your parents the way you were brought up as you get older and mature sometimes you develop your own thought processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've grown up in a small town and then you 've moved to a big town when you go back to that small town it 's going to look different it 's your life experiences shape the person that you are so what makes me me is everything that 's happened when I was born up to this point good bad indifferent evolving experiences that I 've had some of them good some of them bad some of them happy sad everything but it 's all work towards creating me you are a distill version all your past experiences all your life I have an accent that came from the people are go with it was rough and tumble class but you are a dispersion of what happened to you I think then remember when the first party were there boring it I know you have to go every day I think more interesting job I think that gifting and then what your environment just put in there and what your own experiences are putting with Russia very special you 'll remain within that core batiko entity that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange idea about time most people think of time as being even from a very small globe I 've always thought of time existing together but we simply experiences in young me away I find it very difficult to actually think of myself because I know that in five minutes time I will be different just as I was ten minutes ago because five minutes ago I had a good idea and which which means that I know I 'm now a different person I 've never watched myself on TV I 've never watched the form of myself I would find that deeply deeply weird so what makes me me I don 't know but then again I don 't even really think what I am is permanent as I said the person who began this answer is not the person who 's ending it the what makes me me especially as I get older I become even more conscious of just how important my family formation was the way in which I was raised the the religious background and then my parents would I think I 'd say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholicism was taken for granted and shaped everything really it shaped that our education that shaped our family life that shaped our our sense of morality it shaped our sociability who we next with in Australia at that time back in the 1970s and 80s so I 'm very conscious I think of just how important family upbringing is my background was Italian my parents were born in Australia but all four of my grandparents were born neatly and I suppose I 've become more and more aware again of the distinctiveness of that background I mean I 've always regarded myself as an Australian I don 't speak Italian I 've only been there a handful of times but I 'm aware I think of just the difference the distinction of that kind of upbringing in that kind of environment that the family history I think that was the family stories that sat there stories of the Second World War for instance and my grandparents being enemy aliens and all that that meant and and I think that as I as I become older I become more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and and sometimes how little I 've been able to to reshape it so you know we become different we we do we make choices about our lives but you know in so many ways I remain a product I think of that of that family background and that upbringing in a particular place Melbourne of the 1970s the northern suburbs there is utterly ethnic close that was totally dominated by Italians and increasingly both Greeks and and that that will shape the way I look at the world in dozens and dozens of ways [Music],"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

their perspective probably we shouldn 't cause me so but we kept that till the the early nineties and don 't turn even after we 've sold the property which is we sold it to Chapman 's in a you know I 'm only because Uncle John under retire and my brother John he he wasn 't really active in the business he as a part of the product so they don 't my my brother Frank and I and that so we decided

biggest legacy that we 'd have as far as counselors concerned you know we took an ad in the papers sort of saying we 're closing all that sort of things so that was sort of to me one one of the sad things even though we 're starting off a new as my brother and I are starting off new businesses but I think that was a sad thing another sad area was the Depression years which my father and my uncle would were just taken over the business and the impression was on and the stuff those guys would have to work days on and they take it that day off they 've done local kind of days or you know one I 'm like dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and it 's probably it 's not so different to part-time staff nowadays but in those days where everyone was full-time work it was son it would have been a crunch

dozens more in yourself world for a few months we came back just in time for the council to get bombed that done but my dad stayed there Michaelmas at the war and and a lot of other people 's

lovely parents who not only loved us for kids but they really respected us and backed us on whatever whatever we wanted to do they were there to help Robert was feeling shy when he 's young he was spent a lot of time his room drawing and stuff is to enjoy patterning right from the day one really everything he did was really had a pen anything you know he 's always you know doodling or doing stuff like that and it was just it was just good at it minion cutting out a coupon in a pig 's magazine sending way for a correspondence course or kartini it was a six-month of course but that 's pretty much the only training head in in that field I can remember but he did do a an animated movie a very small one and he had it filmed on 16-millimeter film and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dad down to Sydney to hanna-barbera studios now quite impressed with his work and actually offered him a job he pondered about it but I think he thought talked out of about living down because he was still pretty young and he would have had to drop her team bobbing in pay Zoe decline you have to wonder withering where it would have gone with Hannah Barrett Metis as good as any I 've seen but personally having nine forty-two years I don 't think he will walk that off what are the first jobs i gave him when i became a council and i chaired our traffic and transportation committee was to get him to design bus stops force so not only did he do cartoons you also designed the best bus stops in the city it was a really great council ployee and just a great guy genuinely and who just loved doing things for the community what it is doing for us at the sum he was he was doing cartoons so what would happen is he will talk to the editor Harry Bligh on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do a cartoon about this week i think that ninety percent of the time he already knew that he was just being nice lets me talk about it and I 'll talk you around about what I want to do we 'd have been brainstorming sessions for

had to be subject matter that had some meaning for him if they wasn 't just a cartoonist for hide it was actually Curtis has had a favor to say if you really get ready never look sorry sir three things it was always something about it but never meant to be malicious never had a just bone in his body his humor was was very gentle it could be sarcastic it could be biting but you know if you were featured in it you never thought that it was nasty you just didn 't have a dad to get a nasty bone in his body he just had an act he had that capacity to sort of dial in on that prominent feature

let 's bring out for forty-odd years now you 're still playing in it I when he passed away as a band member he was the drummer own if I could just explain something the band is driven by the drummer of the bass player you know there were two guys that hold everything together we guys at the front just think we run the van but actually the base in the drums will hold it together and you know bob was just a consummate drummer and sort of held the band together but not only musically they hold the band together he saw held held their personalities together I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more than just a drummer in fact um he came one night there I 'll never forget it and rainy up on the Thursday and said you go can you get another drummer for our sad days geek I said why he can 't you make it

minutes if it 's a walk along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major shopping centers to do some shopping or it 's quite simply getting to a meeting on my push bike we 've got a major Regional Hospital base here with the with the Townsville general based hospital servicing large parts of northern Australia schools there 's a huge variety to choose from we had no problem getting our little girl into a daycare centre and the the waiting list is definitely aren 't as long to get them into different schools and institutions here in a smaller centre but when we keep saying smaller centre Townsville is the largest regional city north of Brisbane in Australia we came to Australia about ten years ago and looked around business opportunities and found that Townsville was probably one of the most stable markets that we could actually move into from an economic point of view you 've got so many different facets to it 's not relying on one particular element so it 's very stable and being a small to medium sized developer we builder it was the type of market that we look for so that we 've got stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm an interior designer by trade so I 'm finding that the homes here are much larger and more luxurious for what the money is compared to other capital cities that I 've worked in and I don 't feel living in Townsville that the amenities are any less than what we 've had in capital cities if anything lifestyle is much more relaxed everything is still on our doorstep just the pace of life is a bit slow which is not about it 's fast enough let 's be better and I feel that the population growth I just I just feel that there 's opportunity in Townsville it 's quite exciting to be living here at this time because there are so many people coming into town new businesses opening up and the council and the government are really behind Townsville and you can feel that in the air this amazing opportunity here okay do you love the shop yeah and the shopping and the center of town is phenomenal this restaurants opening up I love the bar scene in town I like that as well we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers open just within tones or where you can get from one side the other in 50 minutes and within sort of for two and a half three kilometres of the city you get to major residential communities just being built just now so you know literally you can jump on your bike and get into the city within 10 or 15 minutes and a push bike and it 's very affordable you 're that three hundred four hundred thousand dollar price point for a beautiful house within a few days it 's it 's just unbelievable we 're never short of anything to do and the weekends there 's always something going on and we just the v8s was a big thing for me because it it just really brought a lot of people into town and the city was alive it was fantastic really great atmosphere we are here to stay definitely absolutely business opportunities in town are great lifestyles great that 's really coming alive the city you know the last I 've been as I said working here for ten years now and just I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just blossomed and so many opportunities onwards and upwards I moved to Townsville in August 2011 job opportunity brought me to Townsville after I can pretty much a CH D I received two offers from Australia ones from James Cook University and other from a university if in London I chose JC you because I was an ongoing position academic position and also hopefully a better opportunity for my academic career development I love the Strand it 's one of the most beautiful beaches in the world I have ever seen and also the kissing porn the new park is just brilliant fantastic if somebody approached me about as well I would say come over to experience transfer you will love it I originally moved here when I was 17 so I was invited to join dance North at 17 as a dancer so I came up here from Brisbane and spent four years working with the company then and I was away for six years living in Adelaide and touring all around the world and living in Melbourne for a bit and then I came back here in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic director of dance North now and have been back for about six months there 's a really rich cultural kind of history to Townsville and I think looking forward fest it was like the Australian festival chamber music amazing work that 's being done at the first Tucker regional gallery and umbrella dance north but there 's lots of energy I think in the creative sector at the moment I guess it feels like there 's never a shortage of access points for creativity and culture in Townsville the community is very vibrant and strong it 's really rich so you know there 's performances on the weekend of the Subic or Alec River way or here at dance north we 've got three amazing venues that you 've got kind of triangulated programming selection so people can engage with a wide range of performance you know across a broad range of areas or fields so you know music theatre dance there 's something for everyone which is really exciting so we do have the selection of a major capital city and I think the quality of art that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully on the world stage so for me now having the chance to take this Townsville based company to perform in Paris to perform in London to perform in New York to

Australia",1367,my name is Peter Lawson I 've been an artist all of my life and I 've managed to live from my paintings for all of that time the life of an artist is coral each can become quite infinite indeed because like a whole lot of creative things that one takes on the more you know about it the more you realize you 've got to learn so here I am talking to you as a complete beginner as an artist I would describe myself as a representational painter in saying that of course one always looks for something that loosens their work and so I have been regarded over their ears in different articles as an impressionist let 's go right back to the beginning my parents told me when I was an age of understanding that when my little mates had their toy trucks and their guns and things that I had a pencil in my hand so my parents my good parents knew right from when I was a very small child that I had been given a talent and they encouraged that later on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was 11 or 12 my father took me out out west with him he was a PMG linesman and they had two in those days they had to stream telephone lines between saplings desert desert sticks and stamps and I went with him and and the reds and purples of the Selwyn Rangers and places like that west of here intrigued me and indeed my father said to me later on in life Peter even at that age you said to me dad I 'd like to paint this country having grown up in Townsville having schooled here having crabbed it 's creek having fished its waters and having wandered all around this city I 'm basically in love with it all and I love by Connie Castle Hill I love the way that it backdrops most of the cities and in fact I 've used it as noticed many times to do just that I a wonderful Mountstuart out here and many peaks and and the surrounding mountains of this once upon a time volcano have always intrigued me all of my life and even though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled and I 've traveled to other countries many times I 've always been sentimental sentimental about Council and always imagined that I would paint around this area for the rest of my life well I certainly do and I feel a part of this upcoming celebration of 150 years simply because for a lot of my life I 've taken it on to visit the archives and JC you you have a very good and comprehensive archive and collect our photographs of street scenes of Townsville and some of those they 're coming up to 150 years now and illustrating the mess they were horse and carts women in long gowns the whole lot so after doing all of that work on illustrating the history of Townsville of course I 'm very pleased to be a part of our 150th celebrations I was where of course when I was very young that Henry Lawson was the brother of my grandfather my father 's father so of course as as a fairly young boy I became aware and even become quite fond of his stories and his poems so by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in illustrating the writings of my great uncle henry lawson and i went ahead with that to some success because publishers then saw it important but they publish books that i had in australia dove Lawson 's work simply because we were related one of the very earliest things that Dennis hardy said to me and I 've used it often and I used to just recently talking to students or talking about students one of the things he said to me is as I left his house the afternoon that I told him that I was going to paint for a living professionally as I remember walking down his front steps and he said keep your palate wet Peter so I he was important to me in that sense and then of course we went on to illustrate books together both in both on charters towers and ravenswood and and I became like Dennis did very interested in in the era of the gold rush days and i started illustrating that these towns and these things that were pertinent to the gold rush era I have a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked with that error a lot but in the long run it 's not the era or the person or the the incident or event that 's happening or even the view or the scene it becomes something that touches you deeply regardless of what type of object that is but I think my real love these days is painting on location from life admiring creation representing it as best as i can and interpreting it so that people can understand it so as far as were you know I mean often people ask you what do you really like to paint well everything I 've ever painted I enjoyed painting even if I made a flop of some often a very close friend of mine but i don 't think that painting will ever be shown however all are interesting in their own way but it occurs to me that it 's not that I look for a particular character when i 'm looking to paint a portrait it 's the differences in people that really intrigued me is an artist and I think that goes for photographers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person that makes them an interesting subject our subjects really choose me rather than me choosing them they appeal to me for different reasons and after a long time painting you realize that you are surrounded all of the time by subjects and so you choose what touches you as an individual most then I believe you 're working within your purpose the styles of my painting changed drastically over the years when i first started painting i realized that i was staying within boundaries because of what i didn 't know about painting nowadays things are different but because as you broaden your experience i suppose in anything that you 're involved in in life you 're broadening experience also broadens the levels of your styles and the appreciation of of what you can and cannot do and of course as you get older that that that containment of your creativity just grows bigger and bigger and bigger until you feel sometimes that you 're totally uncontained however some 50 years of painting of course you do a lot of work thousands of paintings indeed and thankfully a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years I only have so much work here so all of the other workers obviously gone out into the mark under the marketplace apart from that I 've often been committed or chosen to illustrate a book where there 's a collection of paintings involved and those collections have been then bought by patrons and in a lot of cases those patrons have given those collections to institutions consequently the tensile City Council and the council hospital to name a couple of them have large collections of my work this retrospective of my work is a culmination of course of all of my thoughts and all of my endeavors in in my art however all of those years and so in that sense I think this exhibition is my most important exhibition ever and I hope that people appreciate or at least I hope that people like what I 've done and like what this wonderful gallery and their staff have put together for me you,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"

Australia",1243,ah hi there I 'm Ross solo used to be the director of the first Tucker regional gallery in fact i came here in 1986 left in 1996 so it was a decade living in townsville I think for me personally internationalizing the program we developed very soon in our programming looking at the wider region and I especially was very interested in forging cultural relationships with Papua New Guinea my family has a little bit of history of Papua New Guinea but in 1988 when I I 'd only been here two years our council hosted the International Festival Pacific arts so that 's a vent that travels around the Pacific and it 's very unusual for Australia to be a host of that event so over 12 Pacific island communities were represented here as far away as Easter Island and as close as Papua New Guinea and of course council had a sister city relationship with Port Moresby so I thought there was a bit of a logical link for us to make connections with the wider region so we curated an exhibition called look look again which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PNG preppy gian and we looked at the contemporary art developments and Papua New Guinea frog from its inception Xin the mid to late 60s up until the late 1890s well the landscape that was here when I first arrived would strong it 's very interesting that there was quite a thriving art school here and there were a group of artists who taught into that art school many of them have come from else run australia and indeed from overseas so is this strong very active contemporary art activity here in Townsville and there were also developments such as umbrella studio kicked off in the kind of late 1980s and i have to say at the time in Australia that 's a great deal of interest in regional Australia and regionalism and that was really our governments were very focused on that so we we really harnessed all of that energy so we curated exhibitions of council based artists we develop linkages with other regions within the north and particularly with 24-hour art and darwin and even ventured over to perth to try and establish linkages with a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called artists regional exchange which in a way is a little bit of like a forerunner to the apt at queensland art gallery so we looked at trying to establish some really interesting networks across the whole of that you know what was happening in terms of regional northern and kind of western australia so the community was strong we really focused on that from for me there was no interest in pretending the towns who was somehow a suburb of sydney melbourne opera span I thought it was much more interesting to try and program and to work with the artists that were here so there were the two key things really working with the others were here which was very strong and vibrant and kind of developing some interesting networks that were not to do with kind of referring do fering back to brisbane Sydney or Melbourne but with other regional areas oh that 's a such a difficult question I 'm really you 've really caught me there well there 's there 's probably favorite things I can 't think that at the moment but you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some interesting great foundations to the collections we collected some really nice historical things i curated a show called artisan tropics which in a way allowed us to research the historical practice and those who visited the north over over a century so allowed us to look at acquiring historical works historical photography modernist artists artists who had worked around Dunk Island in areas like that so I to be absolutely truthful I don 't necessarily have a favorite work but I love the fact that we were able to build up some depth in the collection or and also to build up as you mentioned before the contemporary Pacific art collections as well and I think we 've that way I 'm still talking as if I 'm the director here but when I was here we we did I think develop a really strong collection of contemporary PNG art so I guess that 's the foundation that I laid here and I 'm quite proud of that really I guess I 'm just I 'll just refer to the answer I gave you a month about in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't a suburb of Sydney Melbourne or Brisbane and to see the importance of the practice that it was going on here that was the arts who are active here but also to see that historic continuum of artists who practiced here and left a visual legacy of the bit being in in the tropics and being in the north and what quite unusual about that policy at its a thematic policy mostly policies are about specific movements or specific media or and a lot of regional gallery same Victoria collects specific media and textiles photography ceramics whatever this one was more thematic based and it allowed us I think room to kind of look at a whole envelope of what the tropics here it 's not only necessarily the tropics of Queensland but also the tropical region and in the mediate kind of geography of this area well there 's that which was I think a really breathtaking audacious acquisition for a fledging fledgling regional gallery it 's a large work physically it dominated the space in fact it was so large it was impossible to store it we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wasn 't on the display can you believe that there was actually i have to tell you there was another very controversial acquisition that I made when I was here I was fascinated by the work of robert hunter and a work by Robert Hunter was acquired and that caused such controversy it was front-page news one of the counselors took it upon himself to create a replica of the work to have himself photographed wearing a beret a scarf pretend artist in front of this replica and that was on the front page and I thought 10 marks out of 10 he wants to create so much political mileage out of crying a very important work by an artist who 's very important the Australian canon but well that 's great publicity for us so once the initial controversy died down we actually curated an exhibition about the pros and cons of this work so that was a really interesting thing to do so we had all that newspaper coverage lined up on one side and then we had although you know the pros for the work so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really wonderful that contemporary art can generate those kinds of debates because I don 't think now do you do we get those kinds of controversies his person I had any sort of controversies like that I don 't believe so you,"(-19.2589635, 146.8169483)"
