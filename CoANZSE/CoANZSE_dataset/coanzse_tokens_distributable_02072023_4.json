bringing you another bloody classic i think i can say that quite simply shake and stir our back and this time with Bram Stoker 's classic twisted tale of Dracula she can stir a one of Australia 's most successful and popular contemporary theater companies and just looking at that you can probably see why so who came to see weathering Heights last year anybody yep so you will know just how sophisticated their set their costumes and their lighting design is and trust me Dracula is going to be another or inspiring piece of gothic theatre and if you were here lucky you might remember the time pretty spectacular happened that has never happened here before it actually rained on stage in fact I think we can safely say that it poured so shaken stir this year are going to take it up another notch the Dracula set is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very eyes and we know this because Beck and I and several members of the glass health team had a little social road trip and we went up to Brisbane to cease production in 2015 and it was an incredible night and we still talked about it and we are coming back in March so I would suggest that you 're getting in book your tickets before we do with all of our friends and at this point would also like to acknowledge focus magazine who are the presenting sponsors of Dracula at the glass house in 2017 thank [Music] you adored her as the divine respect and now cats returns to tell the story of Fleet Mac Fleetwood Mac 's greatest song bird in go your own way the story of christine mcvie this production was commissioned by kate ceberano for the adelaide cabaret festival so i can assure you it 's not another tribute show this is a rockumentary it 's a play with music and features a cast on stage telling the story of young schoolteacher christine mcvie as she picked up a guitar started to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors the story a band and of course the enigmatic casa al horn who brings McVie to life on stage singing

doesn 't time fly when you 're having fun and in 2017 we 're delighted to welcome them back with our care a production which is inspired by the classic ballet Swan Lake as you can see from the video and the image that you see behind me RK will be an exquisite production and it 's suitable for all ages founded in 2007 the Melbourne ballet company has a reputation for being innovative and accessible it is now in high demand across Europe Asia and North America for its innovative choreography we know that port macquarie loves its ballet and performances can and do sell out ok will be no exception so please book your tickets early to avoid disappointment [Music] okay so this one 's a little intense you said drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gothic thriller teresa i kin is a story of murderous star-crossed lovers it 's a carnal cruel and corset food masterpiece think Downton Abbey on steroids terraria Keenan is a superb examination of corrupted morals said in the dingy back streets of Paris inland in the 19th century Therese lives the life of servitude and is married off to her sickly cousin in an arranged marriage but a life is turned around when a husband 's friend Laurent arrives and they begin a passionate affair what follows makes for a gripping thriller and emotional rollercoaster critical stages are what of Australia 's most prolific producers of theatre and they are masters of exceptional set and costume designed combined with a haunting soundtrack and great acting this is a wonderful piece of data also as a little point of interest French literature has recently gained traction in today 's contemporary theatre world with a number of dramatic players currently in production as a result the script for Therese raikkonen has been very popular and was recently presented on Broadway with Keira Knightley playing Therese now this might feel like a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe hands with critical stages who have previously bought us syncopation and the goals in grey and I promise that just like a great movie or a great book this story would stay with you for days after you see it now for a complete change of pace buckle up port macquarie the International Melbourne Comedy Festival Roadshow bus is reading as its engines and it 's heading our way once again this winter without fail the Melbourne roadshows delivers the freshest and funniest and sometimes

nice night of belly laugh Baker 's food missed perhaps the perfect drama for our glass house a drama about art this drama is based on a true story in making it all the more compelling in this production we see two very familiar faces reunited John Wood and Julie no he 'll the pair once charmed us with their on-screen chemistry in the much-loved TV show Blue Heelers John is well known to our glass house drama fans having joined us in 2013 the David will influence the club Julie plays Maud a 50-something unemployed bartender living in a trailer park she bought a painting from an op shop and she 's convinced it 's a Jackson Pollock worth millions John Wood is a new york art critic he 's here to authenticate the painting and what follows is a hilarious and thought-provoking encounter of two people over what may or may not be a great piece of art it 's not so it 's not so much whether or not it 's a Jackson Pollock what this evening in this theater will leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people truly authentic that might sound rather dry and intellectual the best drama deals with highbrow cultural issues wrapped around punchy one-liners and some very funny moments I think you remember this production long after the lights go up [Music] I [Music] crazy sexy cool journey deep into the dark delights of the Paris underground with comedy magic illusion burlesque setters and so the first time ever at the glass house and all in one show you can witness incredible feats of magic mind-bending illusion tantalizing burlesque comedy singing and gravity defying aerial artistry this

in 2011 the orchestra sold out and in 2017 we will be presenting it on the thesis thrust stage that means we have to remove a few seats from the auditorium so that means there 's less seats available for sale so I encourage you to book quickly Shakespeare there 's no denying that the bar as we call him is one of the greatest and most influential writings in all of English literature and bill Shakespeare is one of the world 's most foremost producers of Shakespearean works and in 2017 they 're going to take you to surprising places in a politically charged modern-day interpretation of the Merchant of Venice this production explores the tense relationship between those that have and those that have not with dark humor romantic hijinks display will take you on a journey of love mercy and justice in one of Shakespeare 's death Nolan and most widely studied plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you who prefer not to come out too late at night and then another at 8pm just might take this

    "text": "initially i made a phone call to council to try to get them motivated to upgrade the skatepark facilities in fort macquarie i saw that there was a need a change in the culture a lot of people were getting away from mainstream sports and getting into other sports and that the facilities that they had in this town just weren 't up to scratch as often as i can as often as i can there 's not enough hours in the day i try to get here every day every weekend and some in the weekdays like nearly every day play about three times a week generally three or four times a week or every weekend and a couple times a week but every weekend anytime i 'm free the sun would like more but every couple of weeks i guess a few times a few times a week turned out really good just by the amount of people using it every day day in day out from sunrise and even after sunset it 's just amazing it 's been there 's a lot of it had a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been the top five skate parks in australia it 's really good better than the old one a lot bigger and better quality i come up here every day for a walk and it 's the best thing i can sit down and have a look at the young people enjoying their self it 's about time it happened and it 's good for the town good for the young people and another thing too they respect it and they respect their teammates you know as they 're skating they 've taken the turn so it 's all really a choice thing for the team uh it 's really good it 's like i know a lot of people have come from other towns here so it brings people into fort mcmurray lots of different terrain especially for little ones as well with big kids and little kids together it 's good yeah it 's the best one that we 've i 've been to really good it 's a joy to come down here it 's really good like way better than the other one i really like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than that it 's real good it 's pretty sick i like coming down here and skating it it 's really fun excellent yeah i 'd love to get on it myself but i can 't it 's fairly unique you wouldn 't have one that is the same it has similar characteristics to other skate parks but it is very well suited to the sort of guys that use it we we had a lot of feedback from the bikes the guys on scooters and skateboards and different types of skaters that wanted to use it so therefore it 's it 's well suited you won 't go i don 't think you 'll go to another skate park at least in new south wales and see every section getting used so much they they get parts right but there 's one of the key things we spoke about was every skate park that we had ever seen up until this point always had one dud obstacle there was always one dud thing there that you 'd go there and you go what a waste of time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything 's being used to its capacity this has got all ages the real young ones down the bottom down here no it 's really good up and down the coast there 's a lot of variety but this is pretty out there this is a pretty good one so yeah yeah because it has a flap around you don 't really get bored of it uh i think it is it 's got like different concrete and it 's like it 's brand new and it 's nice and fun good ramps some parts of it are but yeah generally really good not really street section 's not really a big thing but it 's good yeah this this part here all the like the street stuff and that it tastes good i haven 't seen a great deal of them but i think there wouldn 't be many better yeah and um it kind of like leads in like a trail where the other ones were just like flat concrete with ramps on them first it gives people somewhere to hang out john i mean like we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was different guys had ramps in different places and there was the council facilities and there was all the schools and footpaths and things like that getting used but bringing it all together in a facility like this gives you the ability to meet other people that enjoy skateboarding or bike riding and brings them all together in one place that 's one thing a lot of the guys said it 's good because you get to see all the guys that you knew did we 're interested in the sport all at the one place it 's got a bowl it 's got good streets and rails and this keeps the young people it proves and entertaining keeps them off the streets and the parents know where they are so they don 't get into trouble it 's all in the open here here and it 's a safe spot for it basically just brings a lot of younger age kids together they 're not on the streets well it 's well it 's great to have somewhere for the kids to use isn 't it somewhere for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some exercise and yeah no it 's babies you 're not bored at home watching jelly and eating um it gets kids that are like bad to come and like have like skate around and get like the anger out and not be disturbing and breaking in and stealing some shots and stuff good for the kids good for families to come down um the bowl is really nice i love riding the bowl keeps everyone active um that everyone can come down and use it and have fun uh you get to teach yourself how to skate and stuff you 're not really riding on the path something for kids to do young kids two years two-year-olds right up to i 've seen 40 year olds on there so nah just keeps them busy keeps everyone out of trouble getting some lights here so you can skate longer at night uh probably like a tarp over i think that wouldn 't like the sun yeah oh maybe some shelter yeah maybe have like a little section for the little kids as well over there lights for the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park and it 's fun possibly a box jump at a spine section just a light source anything else is perfect maybe some of the dirt around skatepark would be like grassed up and stuff nothing i 've thought of i don 't know of any injuries or anything like that i 'm not sure what goes on down here at nighttime but i don 't know i think it 's good the way it is i 'll be another bowl because a lot of people go in the bowl and maybe if that was like concrete as well to put some more ramps in or something ah yeah not very often but because it wasn 't that good i did use the old skate park yeah all the time yeah yes yes oh yeah it 's actually a lot safer initially the engineers were a bit concerned about all the different angles and the different surface quality the injuries would be reduced here because of the quality of the concrete the old concrete was washed out and rough and ragged if you fell over you 've got to graze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fall off you just slide you know what i mean and and because it pushes people 's limits therefore they improve their skills therefore they 'll be safer so yeah it 's definitely it 's a lot better than the old one just 100 better it 's no cracks that 's smoother it 's got way more stuff um it 's a lot bigger it 's smooth concrete instead of gravel more things to do that one was like terrible concrete this one 's nice it 's got the ramps that one had like a couple ramps and that 's it this one is so much different it 's actually built quality the old one was just shocking um it was so outdated just wish this would have come a lot sooner yeah just the bowl and it 's like so much smoother and better quality it 's bigger and it 's got more stuff to do oh it 's got more ramps and it 's a lot huger than the other one oh it 's just a lot bigger a lot more activities i can do all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot bigger a lot more room um it 's a lot bigger and a lot better ramps in a bowl smoother was that it had to be a skate park builder who built the skate park it had to be you don 't get the guys that do the toilet blocks to build bridges you don 't get the guys that do the swing parks to you know take care of you know other things around town it has to be skate park builders there 's three four maybe five major skate park builders in australia at the moment that are even exporting their product they 're even building parks overseas and that was the if i could pinpoint one critical moment in the state park development it was the fact that council agreed and stuck to it that it had to be a skate park builder who was going to build this skate park and everyone a third that 's why this has turned out so good there 's other factors but that is the most important factor you"

    "text": "so about 10 or 20 years I used to live in that house over there and it was always just had a dotted with a couple of people that would never really use the park much except for drinking and at nighttime you could hear people at running around like teenagers being here it was ok but I noticed that it 's constantly being used now since the plants being here it needed work obviously very basic facility I guess there was really a space warm there an active sort of area that kids would engage me know I really only heard about it since it 's been redeveloped everyone been talking about it not at all not very often look we live in port so its up once every yeah three months it 's over well probably once a month or something like that not very often like 40 we didn 't really used to come to it often I still think it might have been parents with small children and people who are using the cafe nearby before there 's a lot of teenagers just sitting around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different feeling now it 's really good yeah really joyful you know I like the lighting in the park it 's as you can come here and i can safely walk through here at night and things like that sounds good but there 's a few different things they come here not just for the playground but sometimes too to ride their bikes and do the scooters which is almost like a different activity for them I think it 's fantastic using the space I mean it 's got some stuff for all the kids as well as younger kids coming from Sydney comparing it to the facilities down there this is I was just saying to my family the best park that we 've been to blue the bike track is a fantastic I think it 's great definitely the best one in the area and it 's good size it 's got lots of equipment for different ages it 's safe within a great location protected from the Sun and the added bike track is just great for the kids and being fenced there 's a huge thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my daughter-in-law boots here at the moment she uses it fairly regularly you know as a treat um probably once or twice a week and I know my my little boy goes to preschool nearby they actually bring the preschool kids teachers after screws and laughing your weekends and stuff at least every two weeks finding that we use it pretty much every time we come up to our up to this area there 's a lot more families and it 's a lot more of a friendlier environment yeah more families of primary school children using it and it seems to cover a broad range of age I think it 's bringing more families to the park and just have a look today we 've got you know birthday party there another one there oh yeah I 've got another scoop I go to import Macquarie and sometimes I 'll come out here to use this part because it 's a good one for big and little kids I think more people are coming here and seeing how beautiful park is not just that little area with Waterman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coffee while the kids play it 's great definitely the fact that it 's enclosed because there 's only alright okay there 's only one other Park in the whole region which is enclosed so you can just sit down and let you kids run away will not run away but run around and they don 't sort of zoom off anywhere another strength is the fact that there 's it 's a trap that 's just really fun with the road works and everything that um and the fact that there 's herbs is really really just enjoyable for everyone I think that 's all women love coming anything who I think that 's great it seems to cope with lots and lots and lots of children there seems to be arranged for toddlers through two older kids I think I think how many really new and clean with a lot of different activities it 's just stayed that way anything there 's really very much vandalism and there 's always someone here playing so so that must help as well yeah it 's just so much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek and the water pump they use that and dig in the sand and you know that 's another thing they can do if you 're feeling like something we feel more secure in the gate see stuff having the closed area as well as the bike rack and then close to facilities its butt I 'm always coming out in the mornings because that 's when the kids are most awake but the kids the parks always in the shade it 's really cold I don 't think so i think it 's bringing more families in there and a better crowd no no I can 't really think of anything I can 't imagine new movie does any particularly undesirable but uh that I 've experienced with it ya know well a lot of the times I 'd like to come up here and I often say these two other women why don 't you go check out the butcher that 's just over there that 's really good they 've got great sausages and and I often go down to the department store that 's here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a couple of other little design shops that they 're little boutiques you probably you know it 's worth a trip to wal hope to go to those and today we 're also going to go to the open market so it 's something we probably wouldn 't have come up for unless there was the park seems to be a boom in younger children in the township which is nice and this was more a retired area the central part of town but I think families are coming in specifically to use this part of town the park of it you know they can go walk walk you you walk to do their shopping and do other activities at the same time which is probably what we do sometimes now this is a militant black meet new friends and stuff bit more kids that come here yeah generally we come to go to the park but we do head off and do a little bit of shopping sometimes as well down the main street to the department store so maybe just a baby swing and a all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lot of kids like if we were to extend the park have it somewhere where the sunlight in lungs just continuing along with the garden I think it 'd be fantastic just extending the poles so that the children can 't get in and out the park themselves the little ones maybe an age limit on some of the things I don 't know that would be appropriate or not a flying fox beach sand pit type thing flying crops are some bigger slides biggest slides and more older kid stuff not just little kid stuff I guess in terms of enhance but the only thing we 've had a problem with on occasion is just the parking I guess and that 's probably more to do with our local knowledge I 'm saying that looking over a lot of parks over the far corner there you"

as a grandmother how proud must have you felt to represent not only your community but your family and your grandchildren yeah very young grandmother is my grandson had his third birthday what I was actually in the Paralympic village so well that was sort of bittersweet because of that the Paralympics but I missed his birthday but I did find him he spent like one second on the phone because it was too busy doing other things um look at the end of the day I don 't think age matters really i think you know if you 've got to try and chase it don 't worry about the numbers i 'm heading out the competition Danielle 's under the course and hearing the roar crowd singing the television cameras what 's it like how did you feel um I was I don 't know if you 'd say unfortunate or fortunate enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a center for ground so happy at first I felt absolutely frightened and overwhelmed um actually wasn 't worried at that point about winning the match I was more worried about not working on because apparently there was a crowd of like five and a half thousand people there but it was it was interesting my coach just said this is your time how you perform in front of such a mass amount of people will set the standard as to where you go from here and I I might have lost the match to the world number two tennis player but I played the best match i 've ever played why am I here for the Australian number one tennis player it is retiring uh yes it 's not one hundred percent confirmed but danielle has some chattered about retiring she 's also talked about possibly trying another sport so yet to be announced but we 'll see so the door is open the door is open I 'd rather defeat her to take her place but yeah retirement is possibly on the cards for Janelle on behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh I actually I don 't know if it 's too lengthy I woke up this morning and I was just going to come along today and thank 30 or so people that I thought would be milling around while I was shopping so I 'm overwhelmed by the amount of people that are here and you know for all of us we thank you so much for the support for coming out tonight but I had a little think about it when I woke up this morning and I actually wrote out a short speech so when if you bear with me I 'll just find it it 's not that lengthy it 's just in large print because I 'm a grandmaster and the first thing I 'd like to do is acknowledge everyone here today and thank you so much for the support you 've given all of us not only today but in the lead-up to the games and I 'm sure for our future supporting our feets that we chase and I 'd like to congratulate Peter as well on becoming there and James and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know for me I can recognize the dedication and discipline and a sacrifice that goes along with what these led to achieve so very proud to sit here today with them being medal holders and I was going a little bit sentimental this morning so I thought I 'd just talk about what the Paralympics has meant for me because a few years ago when I decided to start playing tennis I never once thought that I 'd actually reach such Heights in the sport I thought a number of things are against me including age with selection so you know I pondered over the last two days with the Paralympics closing just what it 's actually meant to me to be a part of the 2012 london games the games are back me with a lot of fond memories and experiences for which I 'm truly grateful and it 's something that I 've never experienced in life before and probably never will again even if I do go to Rio I think each games would be very different than the previous on a personal level apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignited a new enthusiasm in a life area that I 'm very passionate about I 'm not sure how many people here were able to watch the opening ceremony because it was so early in the morning ceremony had quite a significant theme around equity and human rights for people with disability and it 's an area in life that I 'm very enthused about and quite painful about at times so it was quite exciting for me to actually participate in the games the put forward such a strong theme I was in or in England at the games when the opening ceremony under tool to throw out the challenge and call upon the world to take up the cause for quality and human rights for all people across the globe and I was really thrilled with the message they sent out worldwide for all communities to take out that call for equity in human rights for people with disabilities I think one of the things that that 's important for me is that that call for human rights in equity for people with disabilities is something that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to actually sit at the closing ceremony and watch the flame extinguish but I guess you know for me personally I 'd like to see the the the quest for human rights to continue regardless of the fact that that flame did go out on the closing ceremony night it 's in light of this strong message that came out of the Paralympic opening ceremony that I owed you the people of the Hastings Valley to embrace the global message to walk work toward a solid future of equitable inclusiveness in all life areas for people with disabilities in our schools in our community in our businesses in employment and in it the everyday activities carried out in our Valley including in many of our sporting activities it remains fresh in my mind that not long too long ago I was excluded from tennis clubs in this area exclusion based on incorrect negative attitudes and beliefs about people with disability on a personal level that in exclusion cut me to the very core two that I was not welcome to fully participate at local tennis clubs for a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my situation the candle tennis club put up their hand and warmly invited me to play tennis at their club showing an attitude of fully inclusive there 's no boundaries and restrictions the child members are over yonder someone they love it 's a club that boasts 230 members and only three courts minimal facilities that they showed a willingness to pave the way as example to the Hastings community and what can be achieved if prejudices and differences amongst the community amongst the community and put aside without the strong support and there at one hundred percent total inclusive attitude it 's without doubt that I would not have had the opportunity to reach personal best in wheelchair tennis and I wouldn 't have been selected to represent Australia at the 2012 london games so the candle tennis club community I take this opportunity to acknowledge your humble little club and all its members you 've shown the Hastings of people with disability are easily able to be fully integrated in sporting activities I can 't thank you enough nor Express from the very bottom of my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only have you made it possible for me to realize the dream in competing at the 2012 paralympic games but possibly even more importantly if showcased an attitude of equality beyond the norm and your true leaders by example so I take this opportunity to call upon all you people of the Hastings to be led by this example and to not let the strong message of the 2012 paralympic games striving toward equity in human rights fall off the agenda I encourage all our sporting clubs all our social clubs our employers and businesses our schools and us individuals to help keep the dream alive in striving for full inclusion in all life areas for people with disability help us people with disability to breathe life into our dreams to realize our full potential by actively supporting our full inclusion in all walks of life we 've all witnessed and marveled at the diverse abilities of 4200 athletes with a disability it came together in a show of astounding community spirit for two weeks to compete at the 2012 london paralympic games all of us showcased exceptional sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit it 's in light of ongoing memories of what you 've witnessed from the Paralympic Games that I ask you to reflect on the oneness of the Paralympic community spirit and encourage you all and our local level to help keep that spirit alive we can all continue toward building a sense of one community that does not discriminate regardless of differences let 's put the Hastings Valley on the map as leaders in equality and human rights let 's all work together toward the hasting Valley becoming globally recognized as leaders by example thank you"

but there 's some good opportunities there so uh matt will talk about uh that as well so firstly actually we might move into uh just um if matt can if you can just give us a bit of a an overview and and i understand that you uh you 're kicked off as a trainer so you 're obviously well placed to talk about your experience and maybe useful for you to touch on i know with you know when we 're talking with younger people still at school a few nerves um can be at play so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you first started all right thanks vaughan i 'll start off by giving a brief overview of what our open spaces department does and what we 're responsible for and what you could be expecting to be doing if you become part of our team in the future so our open spaces team are very very visual aspect of richmond valley council and we play a very important role within society to provide well-presented parks sports fields cemeteries recreational areas and facilities for the community to use at their leisure to exercise play sport relax plan the playgrounds have bbqs and picnics or just enjoy getting out in the fresh air we also maintain and look after all the trees within our parks and our along our roads you might have seen or heard the street sweeper in the area he 's running around keeping the roads and streets clean and tidy you may have also seen our tractors at work they keep the roads safe by slashing the grass on the roadsides and i 'll also run you through a few of the tasks team carry out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to give you an idea what our open spaces is all about so like one mentioned earlier we do lots of mowing and we 've got lots of different equipment and all different sizes of mowers and tractors to do the job we do lots of whipper snipping and edging to finish off the final touches of our parks we do landscaping and planting trimming and hedging spraying weeds mulching gardens and around trees irrigation work turfing and planting look after soil and plant nutrition tree planting and using chainsaws to prune and cut down trees plant identification litter soil preparation and applying fertilizer and herbicide programs to our sports fields so if you 're interested in horticulture trying a horticulture traineeship i 'd really encourage you to apply it 's a great way to set up yourself with a trade qualification and council can provide you with endless opportunities and it 's a great great career path if you 're keen and dedicated and willing to learn not many years ago ten years actually i started my apprenticeship in horticulture for a local council in the northern new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my experience and how i found it and what i 've been doing along the way so like like everyone i was a bit nervous at the start on my first day but once you 're on the ground you 've been introduced to everyone um and you 've shown the roads you feel fine i felt fine and i managed to fit in well and become part of the team so since starting i worked hard showed initiative communicated well listened to my leaders had a positive attitude and took on board constructive feedback and changed the way i did things to improve i knuckled down at tafe studied hard and put a lot of effort into my assignments um i really enjoyed my apprenticeship and it was always i was always asking questions i was willing to learn so i wanted to get as much out of it as i could later in my apprenticeship i chose to i was chosen to present a presentation about myself and about my knowledge in the field to a judging board in sydney and in the hunter valley where i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year so after that i kept working hard as an apprentice and said yes to every opportunity that came my way and asked to take on extra projects what or doing everything to the best of my ability and trying to go above and beyond when i finally finished tafe i was i contacted my employer and the teacher to ask what more i could do study wise so i could gain some more qualifications i was i was granted the opportunity to take on another trade so i became dual qualified with sports turf management and horticulture parks and gardens before the end of my apprenticeship i was offered a team leader tradesman role within the council and now was not only responsible for myself but also my team i then took it upon myself to mentor and lead my team by example and help them achieve great outcomes by working with many different team leaders and supervisors along the way throughout my apprenticeship i selectively chose the positive attributes from each leader to shape my leadership style that i now use to mentor my apprentices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came my way i later took on project management roles where i carried out major park upgrades and community consultation programs later i was promoted to operations supervisor where i led and mentored my open spaces team being only 24 years old at the time i was managing staff that ranged from 16 years old to 66 years old so for some of them it was a bit of a change and for me it was a little bit daunting at the start and came with many challenges however from my hard work and reputation my strong work ethic and by leading by example and having a firm but fair leadership style i successfully managed to managed to mentor my team and strive to exceed our community needs and expectations with the support of council i then started studying a bachelor of business management at university while continuing to work full-time so after a couple more years of working hard and full of personal development and continuous learning i was then ready to take on new challenges i then applied and successfully joined the richmond valley council team nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces where i currently lead our department so working in open spaces is a very rewarding role it 's a very visual role and we 're constantly creating and maintaining and beautifying areas for the community and visitors to enjoy so like i said earlier if you have any interest in horticulture or gardening and you like getting your hands dirty and working hard i 'd really encourage you to apply for our traineeship working with council is a great opportunity and if you 're willing to work hard show commitment dedication initiative and aspire to put your all into everything you do council has endless opportunities for you so good luck everyone and it chooses to apply and i wish you all the best and i hope to see you face to face working with richmond valley council so that sums up open spaces and i 'll pass you over to paul cows which leads our rangers team and he 'll have a chat to you about what he does and what his team do and the opportunity for a trainee over to you paul thanks

now hi everyone i 'm evan thanks ben um i 'm definitely in the wrong job yours sounds awesome in charge of the best area in rich valley council the mechanical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apprenticeship 23 years ago as they were hard to come by just like they are now although at the time i was told to get a job or stay at school i was always interested in this technical industry and i thought a mechanical trade would be a good start like most important things it took hard work thinking outside the box and challenging myself but in due time i learned numerous skills in many mechanical industries from countless mentors i acquired five trades and with these skills and experiences taken me to work in 11 different countries and all around australia becoming a mechanic was a great idea for me at rvc we have three workshops they are based at evans head casino and coracquire our workshop teams consist of non-mechanical and engineering trades people and three apprentices we are responsible for around a thousand or so items which entails fabrication engineering repairing and maintaining a wide variety of machines and assets day-to-day we carry out preventative and reactive maintenance to this wide variety of machines and assets both in the field and workshop base we follow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment with the unforeseen mechanical failure this is where the juggling act comes into play with prioritising which machine is more essential than the others and we work as a team to complete this just to name a few of rbc 's items that workshop repair we have power hand tools mowers cars trucks excavators loaders tractors road stabilizers garbage trucks backup generators pools pumping stations wastewater treatment plants and many many more we do this whilst maintaining a safe work environment and uphold quality workmanship daily currently we have two apprenticeships um out for grabs at the workshops we have the heavy road transport mechanic based in casino and we have a fit in machinist welder based at korakai workshop these apprenticeships will consist of workshop-based on-site and tafe learning for a period of four years with end goal to become a tradesperson the successful candidates will be joining a great team environment where we have each other 's backs mentoring and leadership will be provided with exposure to a wide variety of machines familiarization and experience on many makes and models troubleshooting and diagnostics and a strong all-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge will be shared by our skilled trades people aiming to equip you with the skill set and the attitude to becoming a great tradesperson for me being a mechanic and a workshop coordinator i take ownership with my team and pride myself in the importance of how workshops play a critical role in any business the rewards for me is being involved in a team where no matter what evolves or challenges we face we rise to the occasion together and get the job done i hope this helps guys uh pastor and vaughan thank you plenty of variety there in the workshops yeah you can imagine uh being an apprentice there you 'll certainly get plenty of experience fixing lots of different things thanks evan i 'm just going to give a short overview of the other opportunity which is the trainee waste and information management so our waste and resource recovery operations and it 's focused at pneumonia in casino but we also have a transfer station in evans head we also provide services out at ravville on a weekend but waste is a very big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve how we do things but this role we 've got a great team running our waste business so it 's a good opportunity there it 'll be focused both on i suppose the data side and serving customers something that we pride ourselves on being very responsive right across our business we 're looking at things like analyzing and reporting on the information that we collect around the waste that 's generated and that we have to manage for our community so what we 're looking for in a trainee in this area is someone who 's willing to work both indoors and outdoors need to have a good level of fitness and be prepared to undertake some manual activities need to be dedicated and reliable we sort of expect that across the whole business show initiative have a can-do attitude be a good communicator but also around information management have a bit of an analytical mind and be good with computer systems and those sorts of things so there 's an overview of that role i should say across all these roles the detail information will be available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six roles i 'd encourage you to have a look at that information tomorrow and also our team in particular sue but

you for sharing and caring for the war in my land that we learn and play on we pay our respects to elders past and present and we share our friendship and kindness hi everyone welcome to sketch mania we 're going to do a class today normally we run classes here in the library but just at the moment we 're just going to run some on video so just remember as we 're drawing you can pause the video at any stage if you want to get your paper ready or if you want to just catch up a little bit so today our lesson is going to be a little bit about cartooning so we all love this this is lots of fun so we 're going to start off today we 'll do some eyes and noses and mouths and experiment with them and then at the very end you 'll be able to create your own page of cartoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first off eyes let 's see we 're going to do some egg shapes for eyes i think for a start so let 's get one eye there and we might just join another little egg to the side there how about that okay i 'm going to put a pupil on and another little pupil we 'll do crazy pupils it 's lots of fun with cartoons because we can just make it up as we go it doesn 't really matter what it looks like at the end and some eyebrows some crazy eyebrows i think like that now that 's a bit strange okay now with our cartoons we can make our characters look and feel a certain way just by the expressions on their eyes so let 's try a little sleepy one do two eggs again and this time i 'm going to put some eyelash eyebrows on him not eyebrows eyelids on him so let 's try like that okay and we need to put some pupils on how does he look looks a bit sleepy perhaps let 's see if we can add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll try on the other side and color those in how are you going with yours at home if you 've got your paper if you 've got texture you can use a pencil as well okay so he looks a bit i don 't know he doesn 't look very interested does he looks a bit bored what else can we do i 've got a few different eyes here uh i think we need to do some mad eyes let 's see we 're going to do some strange shapes there and we 'll do it on the other side as well that 's like he 's squinting his eyes a little bit we 'll try doing a pupil and another one here okay now to make him look really mad i think we need to do his eyebrows facing in let 's just do one there and one there like that very good and i might just put a little bit of under eyes it looks a bit tired actually they 're all looking a bit tired this one looks a bit crazy okay let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes here and we 'll have him where 's that little one looking up one two and we 'll put his little eyebrows going this way okay there we go we 've got four different sets of eyes all looking in different directions let 's see oh noses what are we gonna do for a nose let 's see it doesn 't have to be a person it could be an animal so how about we put a little piggy nose on this one this one 's gonna be a little circle some nostrils oh he looks kind of cute looks like a confused pig all right now let 's see we can do just a little bump like that with some little nostrils in there um we could do a sideways nose on this guy um and for our cute little one let 's do a little pokey nose there we go what else can we make let 's do some not our mouths and see what we can work out all right well we can do some big lips wow and we can do maybe one with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's do some teeth oh it looks like he 's up to no good all right and let 's do a little sweet mouth here [Music] okay now they 're almost there but i think we need to put them in a head in a shape so you can do we could do a pointy head like a cone are we i think we need some cheeks on this little guy so we 'll put some little cheeks on there and we 'll give him a little round head i think he looks like he needs a sort of a spiky head like a square there we go and this little one let 's just do a nice little circle so you can mix up any of those eyes and make them all look different with different noses in different so you need to practice practice practice okay we can add funny ears squiggly hair he 's already got big cheeks we 'll give him some funny ears as well you can fill those in this guy i think he needs boxy ears because he 's all boxy anyway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's make this lovely long here oh yeah we can put a hat on her let 's put a hat on her and better put a neck okay so you can keep going and you can create their bodies and put squares and circles and everything like that so okay so we 've got our little people here if you want to follow along with me we 're going to try and draw a puppy dog together okay so first thing i think we should do is it 's nose so let 's do a little black nose okay i don 't think my puppy dog 's very happy so he 's gonna have a little sad face now we need to put his muzzle there we go and we need to have two eyes so i 'll do two half eggs oh he 's going to have big beautiful eyes i 'll fill them in we 'll hopefully there you go with your drawings can you keep up remember you can pause the video if you want to catch up very good all right i think yes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little round head on him are you going good now we put some ears on he 's going to have big floppy ears this doggy like that then like that there you going good all right now this little body of his is going to be like that two legs and just put three little two little strokes for his feet i 'll put the back of his body on there he 's got some more legs there and a pokey little tail and there 's our dog maybe i might put a little collar on him very good oh i think he needs a little thing on top of his head now with cartoons we 've got to tell a story so what do you think this little dog 's thinking about to do our story we need to do a little speech bubble or expression so i 'm just going to put a little cloud over here and because he 's thinking that he 's not saying it we 're going to put little circles that kind of means he 's thinking about something what would he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think okay so that was very good so four different thought bubbles we can do circles like this we can do just squares like that and if someone 's talking they can have a little pointy thing pointing towards the character or we can put the words inside a big shape like that any sorts of shapes if you wanted to do the word splat we could put it in like a gooey bubble lots of little splat or we could go crack this isn 't spelt right but in cartooning we can put extra r 's in an expression like that and then we 'll put it in a little spiky bubble with some little bits falling off that says crack all right so that 's what we need to do so to make our cartoon on one page i thought instead of telling a whole story we would tell a joke and then we can put it on one page so i 'm not very good at jokes but here 's some examples what does a triceratops sit on it 's tricera bottom now to do that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a funny picture of his bottom or something like that well i 've got an example here if we have a look we 've got one i did a joke i did it says why are you late as a teacher and the little girl 's looking very annoyed at the teacher and it 's shown the time it 's five past nine so she 's late for school and then she says to the teacher because of the sign what sign says the teacher and he 's very angry and see i 've got all these things coming out of his head to make him look angry and she says to the teacher the one that says slow down school ahead and then i 've got a picture of the sign so i want you to think of one of your favorite jokes and see if you can put it into a cartoon so the best way to do this is just get a piece of blank paper and maybe get a ruler and rule a frame around it then split it in half lengthways and you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have a small one here and a longer one there and then get a joke so find a joke that 's one of your favorites here 's another joke i 've got this one is two people and one of them says why do you keep from throwing garlic cloves out of the window you may not be able to see that real well but we will color it in and it says to keep that away vampires and then the other friend says but there are no vampires and the person that 's been throwing the garlic out the window says it must be working but we 've got a little vampire hiding behind the tree so see if you can do that in pencil first and once you 've got it the way you want it start filling it in with your black pen i 've just done it black and white here on this example but you can add color if you like and see what you come up with remember to use some of the ideas for how to put your words and speech bubbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what your characters are going to look like and how to make them look angry or sad okay so get going and have some fun with that and we might see if you can send your cartoons to us at the library send it via our email address okay and we 'll see you again for another class"

    "text": "hi everyone i 'm tim crossdale group manager corporate services at fort stevens council i 'm here with other members of the executive team to provide an overview of where we 're up to with our community strategic plan for the next period of time just before we get started on it i just want to make an acknowledgement of country we acknowledge today that we meet on many aboriginal lands we acknowledge the traditional custodians of the lands and we show our respect to elders past present and emerging through thoughtful and collaborative approaches to our work next i just want to give a quick overview of what we 'll talk about in this webinar which is what is the community strategic plan how does it work at council how we 've engaged with the community so far in the development of the community strategic plan and then we 'll go in and touch on what the four community strategic plan focus areas and we 'll outline some of the proposed changes that we 're making for that based on feedback we 've got today and we 'll also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can continue to be involved with the development of the plan so first of all what is the community strategic plan really what it is about for council and all local government is the community plan it sets the priorities for the next 10 years based on what the community see for their area we it provides a way for us to support communities play a part in the implementation of that plan whether that is through supporting council services or indeed uh council advocating on behalf of the community for key issues it also determines council 's role in being able to meet the priorities of the next 10 years and we 'll talk about that further as the presentation progresses and it also sets up for council to stay accountable and transparent to the community in terms of what we deliver at the highest level within the community strategic plan we set a community vision which for port stevens is a great lifestyle in a treasured environment it means that all that we do with the community or the community is to achieve that vision that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify others that can help and measures to know that we are on track and we divided over four main areas which we will outline further as we go through how does a community strategic plan work really what it is about is once those objectives are set council then needs to determine how and what it can do to help support that and that is outlined in what we call the delivery program and our operational plans that sets up what we do over a four year period and then what we would do each year of that in order to give effect the plan we obviously have a range of other things that help us support it particularly around our resources we have our long-term financial plan our workforce management strategy and also our strategic asset management plan and that really outlines what council resources are available to be able to give effect to the community strategic plan over the course of four to ten years okay thanks tim uh hello i 'm steve pert i 'm the group manager of development services here at council a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the community i just want to give you a quick rundown on the engagement journey that we 've worked on so far at council we 've taken a really strong integrated approach to the way that we 've worked on developing the csp and the multiple documents associated with csp and also how we generally go about our business now from an integrated approach engagement with the community has been really really critical for us we 've been collecting data and talking with our community on a number of fronts since 2020 when we first conducted our first ever livability index survey our livability data together with our community satisfaction results and engagement feedback on other strategies and plans has given us a great understanding of what 's important to our community and all of this helps to inform the review and the update of the community strategic plan so the engagement journey we 've ventured on so far has been through three phases phase one of our integrated approach started really big gathered we gathered lots of data from the livability index survey in 2020 followed by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with place planning and specific engagement strategies on our well-being plans in april 2021 and our economic development strategy last year so phase two of the program shifted to a more local level diving deeper into the results of some of the data a series of planning for your place workshops in quarter four last year were really critical for us to dive into the results of the livability index with the community the workshops focused on immersion into the data and validating identified local aspirations and priorities as well as providing tools for community capacity building and we 've now moved into phase three it 's the final stage it 's about checking back in with the community identifying any key gaps that we haven 't flagged so far and really just starting to report back to the community and at a strategic planning level so what have we heard well we 've heard lots and in terms of the four strategic priority areas as part of the community strategic plan within our community we 've heard about reconnecting as a community building resilience staying safe in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot from the community about maintaining our local roads pathways and connections for community and once again that support for community connection as we come out of the covered pandemic in terms of our environment lots of great feedback which is excellent in terms of coastal management protecting our local wildlife urban greening sustainability etc so lots to do in our in our natural environment space and as far as our council goes we really want to start being consistent with the approach that we take to engagement and communication with our community so in terms of our community being our first focus area of the community strategic plan it really focuses on the respect and special needs of some of our specific population including younger people seniors and providing inclusivity to all our local aboriginal heritage and european heritage and our specific day-to-day culture arts and living experiences including vibrant community spaces from what we 've heard from the community already we 've refined some of the wording of this focus area we 've weaved in a sense of well-being and a feeling of being welcome the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcoming community respecting diversity heritage and culture combining the previous key directions within the community strategic plan we 've come up with a key goal being improved well-being for our diverse community supported by services and facilities [Music] hello everyone i 'm greg cable council 's group manager of facilities and services and i 'd like to talk to you about our place essentially our place as covered in the community strategic plan talks about our economy and our businesses tourism and events and also importantly focuses on infrastructure including roads drainage parks community buildings and all the infrastructure the councils provides right across the community it doesn 't however just restrict itself to council 's infrastructure it also talks about state-funded state-run infrastructure and includes our advocacy role as far as that infrastructure is concerned it talks about creating a healthy and happy and safe place through planning for our da 's and strategic planning that 's undertaken here at council and talks also about character and identity and how we create that centers right across our local government area it also speaks to resilience in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of late largest one obviously being pandemic and how we 're built and how we will maintain resilience in the face of emergencies that that are yet still to come from what we 've heard from the feedback and there 's been a lot of feedback in this area as we 've touched on earlier we 've still tried to weave in the constant themes around well-being sustainability connection and resilience and build those right across our infrastructure network and the infrastructure networks that we can advocate for and try and get in place for the community thanks codes our environment is the third focus area of the community strategic plan obviously a really important part of our broader vision for the community and it talks about our local ecology and protecting the biodiversity of the area for future generations including environmental education focusing on reducing our environmental footprint which encompasses everything from waste and the sustainable use of our resources and focusing on community resilience to the impacts from climate change from what we 've heard from the community already we 've refined some of the wording of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was identified as our number one value that 's it number one value in the livability survey in 2020 and reinforce that planning for your place workshops throughout the year to help highlight this importance we 've proposed additional items in the csp focus area to help reflect this importance we 've proposed to break down the current strategy into three components being support renewable energy and alternative fuel use support resource recycling and reduction of waste and support urban greening initiatives at our workshops we heard a lot of comments expressing concerns regarding the loss of trees in the urban environment to help reflect this community concern about making our urban environments cleaner and greener i 'd like to talk to you about the last focus area which is our council and you somewhat uniquely in our plan this is the uh only focus area that focuses directly on council and it really is about our government 's processes and the way that council is set up to be able to deliver the initiatives that are outlined under the community strategic plan and associated plans as well as how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also how we report back to the community over the course of implementing the plan what has become clear from what we 've heard from the community is engaging and informing the community on what council does we 've heard that clearly from the feedback that we 've received through the engagements today and we 've been able to make some changes or we are proposing some changes to this aspect of the csp to be able to enhance that aspect of it one of the other key factors that we have in here is maintaining financial sustainability which based on the ongoing effects of covert 19 like a lot of people out in the fort stephens community and more broadly is a real challenge for council going forward and i 'll be clearly front and center around our resourcing plans and being able to deliver on what the community 's priorities are okay thanks tim so just to recap where we 're at in terms of engagement and our integrated approach to our community strategic plan we 're going into phase three of the engagement journey right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard so far and see if we 're just missing any fundamental gaps it will run from 28 february until 14 march join us for the live facebook q a session on thursday the 3rd march tim greg and i will be all part of that and we 'll be here to answer any of your questions on our approach to community strategic planning and what 's really

    "text": "welcome it 's great to see you see a lot of faces on the uh on the zoom screen so uh it 's great that there is a lot of interest in uh perhaps joining port stephens council and whether you 're an apprentice cadet or a trainee which we will describe uh in fall very shortly i suppose my role really is to just to give you a little bit of background about port stephens council and uh you know why i think it 's a it 's a great um career choice i may be biased though so just bear that in mind i 've worked in local government myself or pretty much by the look of me a long time but it 's over 40 years and as i said i was biased my father actually worked in local government as well and then my father-in-law he worked in local government as well so as i said i may be a little bit biased but i think it is a a really great career choice for anyone considering you know uh it really doesn 't matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of different things now the image of local government despite looking at these uh faces on the screen of some of our managers there um i have to admit it 's it 's not always portrayed as very glamorous or you know adventurous you know it 's not like being a fireman or a policeman or an astronaut but it really does play a very key role in the communities that we all live in so if you 're looking for a job that you can really see a difference and make a difference in your local community over a whole range of different areas i think this really is um something to consider and obviously why we 've got your interest here local government at its core is about you know creating a better um community on where people live um and fort stephens is a wonderful place to live and we are very passionate community we have very passionate staff um it 's not just about roads rates and rubbish which is the general traditional view but port stevens council delivers over 60 different services across a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave you know we run child cares we run cemeteries and we run a whole lot of things uh in between so too many to elaborate on tonight so as a consequence we have a requirement for a very diversified uh staff um we look for different skill sets you know whether whether you 're uh you know an engineer or an accountant or want to be an engineer or an accountant um or you know work in child care or work in trades or be mechanics or whatever it might be port stephens council because of our diversity can offer similar types of roles um that are there so it really is good for career paths you might work in one area and decide later that well maybe i 'm really you know favoring something else with our learning development programs with the opportunities that we can offer for deployment into different areas once you finish your you know your qualifications and things you know i can only say skies the sky 's the limit a little bit about um port stevens council itself um we are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um we have a budget of over 120 million dollars um we 've been around uh in this area here as a council for over 180 years so we 're very stable it 's a secure work environment we offer fair days work for a fair day 's pay or fair days pay for a fair day 's work whichever way you want to look at it it really is a good uh career choice um so we 're currently looking and we have as an organization just as an example that we have currently i think about 17 um apprentices trainees and cadets on our staff that 's right brook we 've got something around that number um working as apprentices in parks and gardens plumbing electrical areas we have trainees in construction administration events and tourism and we have some cadets in building surveying environmental health property services and engineering and we also through our learning development program we support quite a number of existing employees to undertake apprenticeships while working or to complete further education through assistance that we can offer so as an employer and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opportunities for people so i hope i 've just given a bit of a teaser to see where a career in local government can lead and you 'll be hearing from a number of our past trainees graduates cadets and some of our managers about what services and what you can expect in this role so rook unless there 's anything else you want me to touch on um i know there 's a lot to get through tonight but i do hope that from some of these faces that i 'm seeing on the screen here that we do get some really good applications and interests so thank you very much for your attention thanks wayne you 're much better with words than me so that 's why i 've let you have the longer intro thank you um so now guys we 're actually going to hear from our very own apprentice trainees and cadets or our atc 's as we like to call them about their own experiences with psc both past and present from going from a trainee or an apprentice or a cadet all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present time so first up we have jacob penny so jacob is our engineering cadet who commenced with us our 2020 intake of atcs so jacob i can see you there on the screen welcome i 'll hand over to you and you can have a chat to us about your um experience at psc so far thank you so hey ryan my name is jacob and i 'm the engineering cadet here at course evans council i 've been with council since uh january last year 2020 so i first worked with the flooding and drainage team and now with the civil assets team so my work for a day today is pretty varied so one day i might be doing some initial concept designs for improvements on assets and maybe some customer service requests that are coming from the public and then the next i 'll be out inspecting and auditing drainage or road assets so essentially if you 've seen a council asset you know a council asset you 'll eventually work with it so it 's good because no two days are the same there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll eventually get the opportunity to work on awesome and if you had to pinpoint it jacob what do you think the best part of your cadetship has been so far i think the best part for me is probably being the support um everyone at council is happy to help out with whatever you have um and if they can 't help they 'll point them in the direction to someone who can um your colleagues around you have been through the same thing that you 're going through whether you 're at uni or tafe or in your studies so they understand and they 're more than happy to help out whether it 's uni or work related it 's not only the colleagues i find it 's rare for business to offer so much support not only for your professional development but for your mental health and wellbeing as well i think it 's fantastic excellent thank you jacob i from personal experience can definitely agree as well i think it 's the support from everyone around you that really makes it worthwhile too next up we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined us at psc in 2019 as our cadet planner um and has only developed her career from there with us so far so sam i can see you there as well how are you i 'm good says as brook said i 'm fair um and i 'm currently a development planner at psc i was previously the cadet player up until uh this month earlier this month um in my role i am responsible for assessing and determining development applications uh subdivision certificates and providing pre-lodgement advice for applicants um i also answer any general planning inquiries on our duty service and um yeah as a planning cadet i essentially did a lot of the same things but i also got to look at dwelling entitlements and help out with physical commencement assessments as well um and then i was responsible for organizing um the meet pre-lodgement meetings and organizing the minutes after that excellent and i think your story is one that we always like to hear as well sam um where you 've commenced as a kid and then you 've developed your career further and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent role um within the team which is really really fantastic so for those i guess at home watching on and listening trying to work out if connection is for them or not why would you recommend them taking a connection with pfc um i would definitely recommend a cadetship just because it is really flexible with um study and as jacob said the support is really really good um so like for my particular career chip i had a study leave day that i could take to go to uni classes but if my uni was split over two days i could do two half days um i could also change that study day on exam weeks if needed so that was really good to have that flexibility just so i could get that side of stuff done um but also you get really good experience um in your particular like hands-on you get to do the assessments and the determinations and the work yourself but your team is there to train and support you um my team is really good at answering all of my questions um they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah they 're really good uh just to get all of the experience and all the training you need so that when you finish your cadetship you 've got your degree and you 've got real practical experience that you could take on to wherever you go from there yeah i think that 's an excellent point too about the on the job experience sam while studying as something i guess as a recruitment advisor and alex as well as an employment coordinator we definitely look for is that experience it 's all it 's like great to have that qualification and that training um but it is even better to have that on the job experience and something that we also offer at port stevens council which some of you might be interested in is that work experience component as well if you have that qualification and that degree and you are looking to obviously gain a little bit more hands-on experience within a team of like really highly um highly engaged professionals i guess that 's something that we can definitely look into as well and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link you um in the further notes below so although we don 't have any apprentice apprenticeship opportunities this time around i still wanted you guys to hear from our apprentice matt clarkson um so if you 're interested in joining the team as one of our construction trainees matt joined us here in psc in 2019 as our apprentice electrician within our building trains team so now is the perfect time to tune in if you are looking at our construction trainees because matt will be able to give you a bit of a insight into an apprentice at psc so matt good evening do you want to talk about so far um yeah so i 'm matt i 'm a third year apprentice electrician my role is based off reactive maintenance so basically if something 's broken i 'll come along and fix it um the council though such a wide like range of different jobs we do so some are very hard some are you know a bit easier than the rest but always keeps you on your toes um i also do new installs as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even flood pumps and yeah the bonuses i get to do it on some of the nicest beaches around definitely a bonus so thanks matt do you have any advice for those at home that might be thinking about applying for a traineeship or credit chip this year i mean yeah just to quote nike just do it um it 's you know it 's pretty big decision to make now but you won 't regret it so yeah yeah perfect thanks man i couldn 't agree with that one um so thank you so much to matt and thank you again to both jacob and sam for sharing your experiences with us too we definitely appreciate it um so i mentioned at the beginning of the session um that we will that you 'll be hearing from our hiring managers that you 'll be working alongside if you are successful in one of our roles um as a trainee or cadet this year and that 's what we 're going to move into now so you 'll hear from managers such as kate draynon nicole lagrange barry mcdade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you within their teams and as i mentioned earlier if you do have any questions that they don 't cover off on tonight scribble them down next to you or type them out on your phone um as i 'll be giving you some information on where you can send those through to us online and we can direct them through to the um correct people so first up we have kate dreinen so kate joined us in 2018 as our development and compliance section manager working within our development services group so she brings a whole lot of fun to a very engaged group so if you 're interested in joining the team as a planning cadet like sam was um now is your time to turn that volume up a little bit so kate how are you i 'll hand over you i 'm doing very well tonight thanks brooke um uh welcome to everyone online tonight uh it 's it 's quite a new experience for me so uh bear with me as i uh endeavoured to present to you the exciting world of uh development assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliance section manager um i have four teams uh that work with me including the development planning team and uh this particular role as a cadet planner would report into that development planning team um the whole section is about 45 really cool people honestly um i have a huge amount of respect for everyone within our team uh and the development planning team are certainly no exception in that space they are a great group of individuals um that uh sort of really modeled that very customer-focused um brand that we like to have here at port stephens council uh it 's particularly important in our area where you know our bread and butter is the external customers um day-to-day uh we 're about service delivery to those customers um and and trying to negotiate outcomes with tricky people at times but you know ultimately uh we we try and do that in the best possible way and um with with the the least amount of bother for all parties um sometimes that means a bit of bother for us but you know that that is actually what makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um planning uh cadet role um look sam pretty much summed it up very nicely uh in terms of what your typical day would be it 's an undertaking development assessments organizing predias um assisting the public with their planning and building inquiries and the thing that i love about planning about the area i work in is i get to get get out and about in the um in in the lga or the sorry our local government area um on a regular basis um to undertake site inspections to firstly sort of see see the sites that we may be looking at putting developments on but what i also like is later going back and and seeing what we 've approved and seeing on whether or not it hit the mark from you know the high standards that i set for myself at least um the other really a great thing about uh the area that we work in and i think um uh it was touched on earlier is that we live in a beautiful part of the world so being able to um go and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always something that that i really enjoy um in terms of the person that we 're looking for in this uh cadet planning role we 're really looking for someone that models similar behaviors to what we 've got now you know someone who is a motivated person someone that 's obviously um started or starting a planning degree um that is really uh customer focus and um has a passion for planning but also probably just a passion for making our community better you know that that ultimately is our roles as planner so you know if that if that sounds um like something that you 're interested in we 'd be uh really excited to to receive an application from you guys excellent thank you kate i mean who wouldn 't want to work in a team like kate 's after she described it like that so it 's very good thank you for your time um in the interest of time though we are going to keep moving on so i 'm going to introduce you now to nicole lagrange who will be chatting to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a very long time but you would not know that she doesn 't look at day over 21 and still shows up with the same enthusiasm that i 'm sure she did on that very first day as well so nicole thank you for chatting with us tonight and do you want to talk through what you 've got for us thank you brooke and welcome everyone yes i have been a council for a number of years and done a number of different roles so that 's really exciting the council does offer such diversity but i guess i 'm here tonight to talk about the work health and safety trainee now if you were the successful candidate you would be working under me and my supervision and you would be working with my fabulous work health and safety team um i guess highlights of the role and i guess the highlight for me it 's so diverse um you know one day is definitely not like the rest every day is different you 're out in the field you 're doing something different all the time yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're also out there going to job sites participating in a lot of meetings like health and safety committees uh health and safety representative meetings so you really do get a lot of hands-on experience which i think is fabulous um you 'd be learning all about safety compliance and also contractor management so that will mean you would actually go out on the job and undertake safety audits workplace inspections i 've already mentioned that you would be involved in a lot of committee meetings which i think is really great because you get the opportunity to learn about all the different areas of council you 'd also learn all about injury management and the workers comp system which is a really interesting field to get in um and we also have a fabulous health and wellness program that you would also be involved in so you know organizing things like flu vaccinations and health and wellness days which you know i think they 're quite fun to be involved in uh so just a little bit about our team uh we actually work within the enterprise risk team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within our and and more broadly we work with the governance team but within our specific safety team i have myself the safety manager we also have a safety officer we have our return to work coordinator we have work health and safety admin support we have two of those people there um they job chair and we also have a contractor management admin officer so as i mentioned um there is admin to this role but also out in the field work you 're predominantly based in raymond terrace at our administration building but you would get out in the field a lot so i guess uh if you 're an innovative thinker prepared to learn um able to multitask because that 's what our team is all about um enjoy a challenge love a good laugh because we are a team that likes to have a bit of fun um you 're a good communicator and you want to make a real difference uh apply you 'll fit right in with us uh reality is sometimes the decisions that we make actually uh change people 's lives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what you 've got and yeah you 're working really well with our team thank you nicole thank you i can vouch for that as well whs and hr used to sit and share the same office um and wahs are definitely a team that you will want to join there is never a double dull day when they are close by so thank you you 've definitely lived up to that one um alrighty next up we have barry mcdade um and he 's talking all things engineering cadets so barry joined us in 2014 and he 's currently our program manager for civil infrastructure um within our capital work section so his team are always hustling along with all their projects and keeping things moving so thank you for sharing your time tonight barry so you want to talk through what you have for us as well pleasure how you going brooke good thank you good um yeah so i 'm barry mcdave so i 've been like brooke says with council for seven years and i 've been kind of surfing around the different um a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm a civil engineer myself by trade um and mostly uh delivering infrastructure projects between project management and design throughout my career um the successful candidate will report directly to me and i 'm very keen to make sure that that candidate gets a a very rounded experience in terms of delivering project and all things engineering uh mostly in the civil space um so the successful candidate would predominantly work in the capital work section and we deliver all councils uh civil and community infrastructure so the capital work section then consists of survey team a civil design team civil project management team uh a recreational project management team structures project management team and a project support team so i 'm i 'm planning like that the individual will get experience across all those different um disciplines and have a good understanding then once we progress through the cadetship of how things operate and all those different disciplines i suppose um so through the survey team like you might some people might consider wayne touchline at the start about working local government and the stereotypes that might go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section would kind of blow you away from that and the whole organization operates in the same manner um especially in our our survey team um that 's very very progressive um and what they do in terms of 3d scanning and all the topography around us and so we can push on with designs uh in that in that space and developing on from there and developing projects from there is absolutely amazing it 's mind blowing and we 're actually in that process of um of purchasing drones to move into that space as well so it is very progressive and like i said we want some to gain that experience and just a bit of knowledge and how everything operates in that space so moving through this survey team and the design team uh the civil design team working mostly in road rehabilitations reconstructions drainage projects occasionally will get more sexy things like roundabouts and traffic lights and um and complete new roads through um through different areas of cbds or or through rural areas as well through a greenfield paddock and then in the civil project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

within his team so what do the people need to know at home darren uh just say thanks brooke and good evening and thank you all for taking the time to zoom with us tonight um so i 'm darren mcfadden i 'm the roadside and drainage coordinator um as part of the works hand trainer you would spend some of your time working with me and my team however you would also work with construction in the roads team and throughout your trainees shoot your report to a team leader and you will generally be working with one to eight people in your team and it could vary day to day um the role on offer um workshop traineeship you will be starting cert ii in civil construction in the first year of detroit next year and if you if you perform well and are enjoying your work your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traineeship further two years reviewing annually offering you certificate iii in civil construction we have been offering this traineeship for two years now and it has been very successful some trainees have gained full-time employment with paul siemens council so what does a rural role look like um like all other roles within council um that no two days are the same um as mentioned earlier you rotate through different construction and maintenance teams on a four monthly basis that complete civil works this includes the roads team placing asphalt repairing preparing roads hot oiling and heavy patch the capital works team which includes all new construction works set out training to road building and rehabilitation curb and gutter and concreting and then the roadside and drainage team here you will undertake maintenance on all works from curb and gutter to the boundary you 'll complete maintenance on works such as pipe and open drainage vegetation including trees signs and guideposts pathway repairs and curb and gutter repairs your hours depending on which team you you are in are either 6 a.m or 6 30 a.m and your finishing time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flexible working

drainage there 's approximately 70 full-time employees we currently have three depots heather bray rhema terrace and nelson bay your starting point will change as you move through the teams we love to have a bit of fun while getting the job done we support each other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look forward to meeting you soon and seeing you have a successful training ship with us thank you darren i think a key thing um i guess to highlight from what darren 's just spoken about is how much time we actually do really invest in not only our atc 's but also our employees so we 're always ensuring that you have the correct training um and the tools to be able to not only just do your job to the best of your ability but also um as safe as possible as well within that supports you throughout that um so on that note i think it 's a really good segue into our next topic and i 'm going to introduce you to our learning and development advisor julianne mcdougall so jules the atc program is your baby of sorts so and one that you yourself have done dedicated a lot of time and effort into um so do you want to have a chat to those at home on what the role your role is in all of this as a trainer or cadet issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm julianne or my name i would commonly go by jules at council um and i am the the learning and development advisor so part of my role is i get the fantastic opportunity to support all the apprentices and trainees and cadets all across um council um this year our traineeships that are on offer the work health and safety traineeship and our construction traineeship they 'll last in duration between anywhere between 12 months to two years in duration and our cadet ships are slightly different and they 'll vary i guess in length depending on whether you 're about to enroll in um your course or whether you 're part way through your university studies one of the key things and i think you 've probably heard it all tonight is that port stevens really does grow our people so all of our trainees and cadets have an individual development plan which we put in place for them and that includes not only just doing your your course of study but also other professional development training like darren mentioned some uh in his uh chat just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work rotations as well which as barry said that gives you good exposure to the different work teams um and also um to the different people within uh within your work area every two months we get all of our atc 's together they come together for what we call a network meeting and that 's a really great opportunity for all of those atc 's to connect and to meet other staff as well because we engage with others across the organization to present a variety of different workshops that can help you in your ongoing development um at council so for me i really can 't wait um i 'll be sitting on every single panel that you all are applying for so i can 't wait to read your applications to get the opportunity to meet with some of you um but i guess importantly you want to know how to do that so i 'm going to hand you back to brooke and she 's going to take you in on how to apply for those roles and the next steps in the process so thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we wrap up tonight as you said i want to take you through the recruitment process here at psc just to make sure that you guys are all fully equipped and ready to submit an application um knowing that we don 't want to make it a scary process for you so the very first step that i recommend you doing is taking a look at the advert and the physician description that we have online on our website for the role or the positions that you are most interested in um if you read that position description you 're sitting there with a big smile on your face thinking yep this is the one for me not only were your parents or your housemates or your partner think that you look quite silly sitting across the computer smiling at yourself um but i think that 's a pretty good sign for you to take that step and to actually click apply for and start your application so before you do start to apply i want you guys to start making sure that your resume looks 10 out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally so you really want to make sure that your resume stands out so if you 're sitting there thinking where do i start with that or i 'm not sure where to start um i want you guys to head over to a website called canva c-a-n-v-a um and they have hundreds of great resume templates that you can use or be inspired by to create your own you want your resume to have a little bit of your personality in there but still be quite clear to read so um canva is the best website to use for that and the best part of it is it is also free so even better we all love free things um so many of you will also be very very happy to hear that we do not ask for a cover letter so we only want your very best up-to-date resume as well as a copy of your academic transcripts so that can be your university um or your hsa results or your most recent school report as well um and then all you have to do apart from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the application um that is listed in the advert so i guess when it comes to writing your criteria sponsors a very hot tip for you make sure you write them in a separate word document so i hear so many times where people sit there and they write out all their responses and then i see our beautiful system that works so so well all the time it does sometimes have its faults and it does sometimes crash um so my biggest tip for you would be to save it in a word document separately and that way if anything does happen you have it there separately and you can email it through to us if you do struggle to upload it so make sure you keep that in mind and save that somewhere else so once you 've drafted you 've reviewed them you 've reviewed them again you 've got someone to check over them about your responses and then you 're ready to click that um submit button upload it the closing date for your position of interest is always listed in our adverts so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortlisting in the weeks following so it should take around two weeks for our panels to shortlist and have an answer for you as to whether or not you are progressing to the next stage so i can also say that we are a very proud employer to be part of the circle back initiative as well so you 'll definitely hear that means that you 're guaranteed a response from us regardless of the um regardless of the outcome of your application so if you 're successful or not you will always hear back from us um if you are successful in being one of our lucky shortlisted candidates you will be contacted by one of our hiring managers and they will get you to join us at either a group assessment or an interview so because we do receive such a high number of applicants for these groups we do tend to go through a group assessment i 'll do a group interview and that gives us a chance to i guess meet between 10 to 30 of you before we progress you through to that individual interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health order still remain at this time when we do start progressing you through to those group assessments we 're going to get a little bit tech savvy like we have tonight and we 'll be doing them via zoom um but just in smaller groups and we 'll still make them just as fun as they would have been in person as well for you so after that group assessment if you are successful in progressing we 'll move through to an individual interview um and keep in mind we do normally really take around three to five candidates through to an individual interview for each role so to come from that big group assessment um of around 10 to 30 that 's a that 's an achievement itself to get that far and then to obviously come through to that group to that individual interview as well between three and five candidates will be selected for that one so it makes our job as panel members very very difficult to select from all of you because we have so many good ones to choose from but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so from here um once you are undertaking your interview and if you are successful in progressing to the next stage we take um our preferred candidates through some pre-employment checks in a pre-employment medical um and then we are able to make an offer to our preferred successful candidate so yeah um before we do wrap up i 'm sure you have all been taking notes down or you 've been writing questions to ask and things that you want um answered so if you do have any questions that you would like answered by any of our hiring managers about the positions that they have on hand for you to apply for or anything about our process or anything else that you just want to know about council as well more than happy to answer um if you can send us an email through to our recruitment at portstevens.nsw don 't stress i know i said that very quickly but you can find the address on our website under the work experience tab online if emailing isn 't your thing and you prefer to contact the hiring manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our hiring menu which i believe is jules she 's listed on all of them um you can find jules 's number to contact her via phone um on any of the adverts that you 're applying for as well so you do have that phone option there too if you want to speak to someone um on that note i just want to end on saying a big thank you to everyone who has jumped online tonight um and has joined us for our first ever virtual event i know it might be a little bit clunky but it is our first one and we can only get bigger and better from here so even if you do have feedback for us on the event please feel free to email it through as well i 'm more than happy to take that on board and see how we can improve the next time as well if we do continue down this tech savvy path um but yeah so thank you to all of our hiring managers as well and our legendary employees we definitely appreciate the time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you guys are all free to go so thank you and enjoy your evening"

candidate information session we 'll apologize up front for how we 're having to conduct this and i know we had to reschedule it uh previously to this night but this is the times we 're living in with uh covert so you know we 've got to make the best of it the format we 're doing today we 're obviously doing it on zoom but we 're also recording this and we 'll be putting up on our website we can provide uh further links so that people that may not have been able to come here tonight can at least relive this candidate 's information session it 's being recorded uh in council chambers at raymond terrace and the date today is the 21st of july 2021 to commence i 'd like to pay my respects to the traditional owners of the land and where we 're meeting which is the why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emerging intent of tonight really is to outline to you as a perspective candidates for the forthcoming council election to get a better understanding about uh local government to get a bit more of an understanding about how port stephens council operates to try and clarify some some common questions you might have about the process and the particular you know arrangements going into the election i 'll be sharing this um this talk today with my colleagues as you can see on my right here we 've got uh tim crosstal he 's our group manager of corporate services but stephen purdy is our group manager of development services we 've got greg what 's your name greg greg cable who 's our group manager of facilities and services we 've got our governance manager tony wickham they 'll all come up here and share the talking with me as we go through the session so the background the format we 're going to go through is i 'm going to talk a little bit about port stephens council the geographic area and also about the organization itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities of being a councillor trying to explain actually what we do and how we go how we go about our work and uh we 'll end the session with a bit of a question and answer format i know we 're doing it um by zoom and uh to make it sort of more manageable please ask that the questions come at the end of our presentations um try and write down if you 've got any questions along the way and send them in or we can use the chat facility that is on on the zoom network so uh without too much more ado i will now kick off and we 're sharing a uh a presentation um on port stevens council and you know a little bit about uh how we operate is that gonna work tony if i push have you known um technicalities we 'll get there all right so i 'm sure as you 're aware port stevens council is part of the system of government right across australia now we 're the the level that is closest to the people because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an issue no matter what it might be can certainly guarantee that people that live in port stephens generally the first point of call is during the council offices so when you 're elected as a councillor you become a council official or a public officer there 's a lot of requirements and obligations that go with that role and i don 't try and scare anyone but there is a lot of legislation a lot of regulation that govern the role in particular codes of behaviour um how decisions are made and the transparency requirements that council has to go through to make decisions in in public forums there 's certain pecuniary interest provisions that become publicly available et cetera et cetera we will outline some of those further or mr we can outline some of those as we go through just want to make the point that being part of this system of government across australia and in particular this local area it comes with some you know fairly strong responsibilities all around governance and all around organization leadership and how we manage what we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh the one of my peoples of port stephens council but i want to emphasize it again that they play a really strong role in council works very cooperatively with the laura um in particular we have an aboriginal strategic committee which meets on a quite regular basis which comprises members of of both the peru land council and the waramaya land council it 's important to understand that many things that council does um many of the uh you know activities that we undertake can either directly impact on the land or you know for example it might be our physical works or it could be decisions that we make regarding planning approvals that can then have an important impact on the land so um as a as a matter of course to try and best manage that we work closely with that with the rmit peoples we put our s key staff through our cultural awareness training um to make sure that we are aware of how and what matters we need to take particular uh concern about in particular um you know insurance that we don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community so i just want to again emphasize that um one of my people have been here for many thousands of years we accept them as the traditional owners and that we have a really good strong working relationship with those people which we work hard with and i know we all appreciate that the contributions that we each make a little bit about um the economy or the beginnings of where we 've come from um and i 've touched on the warren aspect the european settlement came into this area quite early in australia 's colonial history and the raymond terrace village council was first created back in 1837 and local government followed very shortly thereafter with the formation of the reign of terrorism dungeon district council back in the early 1840s so local government has had a really long history here in port stephens and it 's amongst the earliest in australian settlement we 've had this pretty much the same size and shape of the local government area since 1937. so the consequence of that is that the the system of government is very strong the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of ownership of the council and that really came out very strongly in recent years when there was proposals to merge port stephens council with uh our neighbours community came out very strongly and that was really when we got a sense of how valued having your own local council with your own elected members is to our community so uh it has a very long and steep history of uh you know helping our community to do what they want to do sorry it 's not working again i 'm gonna flick the button okay so the economy imports stephen 's council where again i think we are again very fortunate we have a very diversified economy tourism of course is uh it 's very large uh down in the in the peninsula but we also have other sectors that have really good employment and uh a lot of uh you know uh diversity in there particularly around the williamtown area with the uh williamtown rackbase newcastle airport and the new astra era lab development it 's under construction big employment generator we also have in the tomago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with the mining industry or defence industry we have a lot of uh industry in those areas uh which are big employers and also um you know we have our aquaculture oysters fishing that is another reasonable sized employer and which puts port stephens apart so in terms of our economy we are generally very stable you know some sectors might have their highs and their lows as we 're seeing with covert but overall um you know port stephens is very it 's very stable um place to work place to uh live which is um which is you know very very um good a little bit about the economy there a snapshot for our local government area you know again a bit more like the goldilocks zone where uh some 860 square kilometers in size which puts us in terms of uh local government across new south wales somewhere in the middle we 're not you know certainly not like the very large councils to the west but we are a really solid size which makes it good because it 's a distance in an area that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that uh you know although we might have had people here since the early 1800s and because of that it 's been a lot of development people have settled in certain areas 20 nearly 25 of our local government area is either a state park a national park or a conservation area which means that uh you know three quarters is developed and settled there 's a large chunk of our lga area that we need to maintain in really good uh pristine conditions and that 's something that also attracts people to port stephens council is our physical natural environment population wise you know we 're just under 75 000 and growing again which places us in that middle middle row of local government areas across new south wales we have a budget of over 100 million dollars currently 117 million dollars which puts us you know running a 100 odd million dollar business is a big scale organization that 's managed you know with over 500 employers local government originally set up back in the day was generally to look after roads uh drains and that sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really changed a great deal since then you know our biggest assets are our infrastructure and as a council we manage over a billion dollars worth of those uh assets when i call it assets i 'm calling roads drains bridges buildings sports fields you know cemeteries child care centers a whole range of different things in this past couple of years um we 've had an expanded capital program it 's not our normal capital program and normal capital program is around the 20 to 25 million mark um but this last year is uh seeing a capital program around 63 million so very very big which puts a lot of pressure on us to uh to deliver people always want to know about debt and our debt is currently you know 18 million dollars which if you could compare that to our revenue and our budgets puts it into perspective that it really is um quite a um you know modest uh figure there a little bit of a snapshot on paul stephens lga okay so what does council do and why does council do it through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities probably 90 percent or more of the things that council delivers is discretionary that is it 's not mandated that council must deliver it or that the council must ensure that it is provided a lot of it is discretionary we 'll talk a little bit a bit later about some of the mandatory things that council must do but it 's only a small percentage of things the reason we do what we do is because of what the community wants to make port stephens a better place the vision of this council for thinking it 's 15 to 20 years has been to create a great lifestyle in a treasured environment i think that 's a really good vision it really can resonate with many many people a great lifestyle could mean by you know living near the beach or in you know in a rural area it could be appreciating that natural environment that draws a lot of people to port stephens um but it also can mean other things it could be for some people and having somewhere to live have somewhere to work having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often that comes with the dichotomy of preserving the natural environment so the council 's vision about what what do we want to achieve for our community and therefore what do we actually deliver is shaped by this vision the council when it 's elected in its first year of its term when it sets its own community plans its objectives about what it wants to do do reviews the council 's vision and it really is a you know a guiding document for the council um for what it does i 'm going to uh what i 'm stopping there tony i 'm going to talk about in a in a minute we 're going to get right into the details about things but there is really two key aspects that we 're going to discuss one is about the council and the governing body the mayor and the councillors a little bit later we 're going to talk about the administration um and how we deliver what the council directs that we do do and we 'll touch on that very shortly but i 'm going to hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us through some of the particular roles and responsibilities that you would encounter if you 're elected as a councilor i have you tony thanks wayne um as wayne mentioned roles and responsibilities as an elected official are very important uh and obviously um for under the uh or define undefined under the local government act so what we 'll do in this next little while um we 'll take you through uh some of those areas of responsibility and some of the roles that would be covered if you were to become a councillor and ultimately be performing as part of the governing body so just to start off with the local government act um it really i suppose defines uh the roles uh in a number of areas um but if we start off at a more strategic level uh we obviously have the role of the council the elected council being the governing body uh we obviously as the general manager mentioned we have the uh the management arm uh as you can see they 're on the slides um the council is responsible for uh community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic direction uh policymaking is a very important role as a an elected official uh as his decision making on a number of council 's functions uh wayne mentioned a few moments ago about the importance of governance uh and certainly that uh is uh a strong element of local government uh but also all like all levels of government the general manager um under the local government is responsible for the day-to-day administration of council and therefore employs all staff to carry out the functions of the council on behalf of the elected body so that encompasses uh obviously our people our finances resources service delivery and the staff will talk about service delivery and our business units in a few moments uh we also provide advice through to senior staff and ultimately on to the elected body of any matters that we come before the council our systems and processes are extremely important uh obviously they enable us to do everything we do here at council and that is all built up or wrapped up i suppose in a registered framework under the act we just look more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some guiding principles for councils and they really start i suppose at the governing sorry guiding principles for local government including decision making the principles around sound financial management and integrated planning and reporting will apply also the objectives of the principle is to provide guidance to enable councils to carry out their functions in a way that facilitates local communities that are strong healthy and prosperous uh so as we 've said that the governing body is uh made up of ten here at council we 've got the mayor and the nine elected councillors the role of the council as the governing body uh seeks to direct and control the affairs of council at that more strategic level uh the effective civic leadership um when you 're carrying out your official duties ultimately financial sustainability is a key to council success uh our community strategic plan and integrated planning documents uh there 's a raft of documents here to wayne touchdown and certainly we 'll be uh working with the new council to implement that uh review the performance of council so council will receive or does receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year the appointment of the general manager is the key staff member that the elected body uh is able to appoint and obviously carry out appraisals of that role the other key aspect in relation to staffing or this organisational structure is that the elected body uh will determine the senior positions in the organization uh community consultation is certainly a key um part of your role if you were to be elected uh there is ongoing um seven days a week almost i 'm sure some of our former councillors have felt that it is 24 7 community consultation so which is a very time time-consuming aspect in the role as is obviously the last point there is very important when we certainly are required to act in a honest efficient and appropriate manner coupled with that the governing body is required to consult with the general manager um in directing and controlling the council of these as we come back down to the next level from the government body obviously the mayor is our leader of the council and of the local community as conducting that particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that definition of the local government includes community cohesion and promoting civic awareness um the spokesperson so the official spokesperson uh here at council uh he 's the mayor and obviously for operational areas it would be the general manager making policy decisions or functions of council is the governing body 's role however the mayor does have pounds under the act to make some policy uh making functional decisions uh between council meetings certainly the mayor will preside council meetings and ensuring they 're conducted in an appropriate manner promoting any of our plans our programs and our policies uh promoting key partnerships with some of our key stakeholders in the lga but also outside the lga and that could be at various levels of government state and commonwealth but also regional groups throughout australia uh the mayor is required to consult and work closely with the general manager um that relationship is an important um outcome of the mayor 's role i suppose um that 's uh they have that keen and working relationship there civic and ceremonial functions the office of mayor does conduct a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also uh our new citizens to australia there are citizenship ceremonies held throughout any given year and again the last one just to wrap up on the role of the mayor um the mayor would leave the um the appraisals of the general manager move on to the role of a counsellor the role of a counsellor obviously is an acting active and contributing member of the governing body uh making considered and well-informed decisions um as a part of that that governing body uh certainly participating in any of our development of our community strategic plans again it 's about having that collective response to the citizens that you represent whether they 're residents or rape parents in the local community certainly facilitating that communication back between our council and the community is an important role of any governing body but also each individual within that the policy making um obviously when we make the policies or council adopts their policies a number of policies which we 'll go through in a moment do relate directly to the governing body and it is important that we all uphold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties uh to make um the next point talks about the obligation on elected officials to undertake professional ongoing professional development so certainly there we have a lot of life experiences that come with um every single individual that stands as a candidate but also we need to um build on that and certainly become aware of what um uh what the issues are in the local government sector and by doing that we are able to facilitate that we can provide access to an array of conferences seminars and learning opportunities finally the council is accountable to the local community for the performance of the council if we go over to the next slide just to give you a little bit of um obviously as a council official um particularly in the uh the elected realm um time commitments uh are something you will come to appreciate um and there are many uh calls on your time throughout uh your turn of offers currently the current council um has held uh they hold 21 meetings a year generally speaking it 's uh two a month um and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government act council is only required to meet ten times a year and has the incoming council uh you will have the uh one of the first decisions will be to uh determine how frequent the council meets um it is also important uh to be aware of your obligations uh of um scenarios where you could vacate your office so as an elected official you are required to attend the council meetings unless you have uh and you must admit uh an apology or seek leave um of absence from the council the council will officially grant that or may um take some other course of action if you are to the there is suggesting difference between an apology and a leave of absence if you are away from three or more ordinary council meetings and you have not had a leap of absence you have automatically vacated your office as a counselor some of the areas that may be included on the agenda and some of our agendas are relatively small but others are quite large so it does vary uh meditation but some of the if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly considering a number of policies uh i think last count we had around 70 adopted policies of council and they 're reviewed on a three-year cycle development applications certainly council has a responsibility as a consent authority so you may be aware that there are a number of das that come to council over time financial reporting we 're obligated to report our budget off for adoption to council but ongoing they 'll be reporting back to the elected body on the progress of that that adopted budget throughout any given year council will set the direction through its integrated planning and reporting framework as i previously mentioned uh so it 's really important um that council is across that document uh effectively uh what 's in that framework and those documents that fall out of that framework is what we will be doing in uh the coming 12 months but over the term of this council and financial assistance uh there 's an opportunity for councillors at times to provide some financial assistance through to the community after adoption by the elected council so holding civic office as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oath of office before you can attend your first council meeting and obviously there are a number of ethical standards under the local government such as the code of conduct and the like that you will need to be trained in uh there 'll be a full induction program for the new council uh over a number of months um and also uh we certainly need to be managing any conflicts of interest at any meeting you attend whether it be a council meeting a committee meeting um or something for briefing um with the staff or the council or the general public um you 'll have legal responsibilities under various pieces of legislation including personal responsibilities for example work health and safety the elected body does have responsibilities under that particular act anti-discrimination privacy legislation public access information and also record keeping and the management of your own records that you 'll receive as an elected body uh there are statutory obligations for those um in the arena of skills and experience and personal attributes that that are required by the mayor or a councillor um and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued by the officer level government um but we certainly will have a summary here this evening of personal attributes and those that would include things like managing yourself uh display resilience and adaptability act with integrity uh demonstrate accountability um your relationships be able to communicate and engage uh have community and custody sorry have a community and customer focus uh work uh across the organization and collaborate with all of your colleagues influence and negotiate um which would then take us on to the results area so you would need to be able to plan and prioritise problem solve create and innovate and deliver results finally moving into the resource area and you would need to certainly have an understanding explain and respect the public funds and discuss the finances of council understand council roles as the custodian of assets and tours of council use and support new technology and information make decisions on procurement contracts according to the value for money property and community benefit finally civic leadership is an important attribute to hold in this particular area as well so certainly we need to be representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make quality decisions some of the key policies that would relate to the elected body are the code of conduct dakota media practice our working together and provisional information policy so uh to give detail on that particular document um we have a policy where the councillors and the staff interact and uh there 's uh approved staff that our councillors can interact and the staff can make contact with our elected body uh an important policy uh is the payment of expenses and provision facilities to the marin councillors and this goes to great detail to explain any type of reimbursement ongoing professional development um and reinvestment for travel um and functions and the like uh in addition to that other facilities we may provide such as facilities in the edmond building for the maryland councillors so that would be something that would be particularly important to be across um gifts and benefits is a um i suppose it 's joined to our code of conduct it gives a little bit more detail about how we manage gifts and benefits here at council and what disclosures need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional development policy it is linked to the officer local government 's guideline in relation to ongoing professional development for our elected body uh and it 's certainly strongly encouraged that all councils continue on with their professional development to serve their community and lastly just to round up on the half dozen show that we have here is the uh the repeater interest returns so on an annual basis um you will be required to make disclosures uh for uh the um preceding 12 months three months into your office term you will be required to have submitted that return and you can certainly access all of our policies online at the website uh in relation to time commitment as i alluded to earlier there are many events and committee meetings and so forth that you will attend as a counselor one of the first things you would do at the first council meeting will be to appoint delegates to an array of committees um and i will talk about them at the moment so your time commitment to give you a bit of a broad brush kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of months uh maybe up to three months will be pretty um intense in relation to evening uh into the evening induction program for councillors um there certainly will be a supplementary program for the mayor uh and the marine council as i 've previously said will have an ongoing requirement to attend professional development as it arises um currently the council meetings are from 5 30 on the second and fourth tuesdays of the month again that is subject to change with the new council extraordinary council meetings can occur at any time um in line with the code of conduct procedures uh sorry code of meeting practice um and we have two-way conversations um three uh tuesdays of the month um two of them will be preceding council meetings and there are opportunities for the councils and staff to discuss matters that are coming before council but also activities and functions across the organisation one of the i suppose largest draw in your your time will be reading and reviewing the business papers prior to each meeting obviously you can have a look at the past papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of information there to review um in addition to those things i mentioned a moment ago that the new council will be pointing delegates to a number of committees at the moment we have 26 355 c committees now they 're community committees uh sports council um various hall committees uh and like across the local government area in addition to that we have uh 35 external groups so that may be a membership on various government committees but also external parties to council where we 've been invited to have representatives such as the marine parks and the like there are a number of regional workshops conferences and seminars the list goes on uh that there 'll be opportunities for councils to attend and obviously that is quite important for port stephens council to have representation at any of those events uh there are an array of community events that we hold across the local government area all year as i mentioned a moment ago australia their end day parades right through to our citizenships that happen in addition to a lot of engagement in the life that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to the items that are going on in council and also you will obviously you 'll be feeling those inquiries as they come through as an individual you 'll participate in formal community engagement sessions the council arranges that we do at times have the councils involved in those and certainly you would receive invitations to attend engaging with the community has previously spoken about is quite a large time resource is required for that particular um activity we move on to the next um slides just to give counsel or the candidates an idea of uh their remuneration if you like uh that comes with being a mayor or a councillor so the amounts that you can see on the screen are the current amounts this is reviewed uh annually by the local government remuneration tribunal port stephens council is categorized as a regional center uh under their definition uh and you can certainly see from their website uh there 's a report that 's released uh around april every year uh which will give you the definitions of every council in new south wales um as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy for councillors um and that goes on to include your phone your it equipment travel conferences so if you 're traveling to and from the administration building uh to attend the council meeting obviously that mileage can be claimed from council um certainly an important aspect is uh an amount of uh there 's a monthly amount available for carer assistance uh whether it be child care or someone elderly uh that you 're responsible for or someone with a disability um there 's certainly a clear definition there to that um counsellors will have access to from the 1st of july next year we 'll have access to superannuation similar to employees so we 're waiting for the new council to come in and the elected body can resolve to receive that or not a mayoral vehicle is provided to the council uh sorry to the mayor um for business use uh and um the to get that that will be there as i mentioned ongoing professional development uh there is an industry of support so the mayor and the councillors have administrative support to assist them uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also provided with a meeting room here in the council administration board mr west thanks for outlining that tony um i 'm sure there will be a number of questions um from prospective candidates about some of the technicalities um that tony has talked about and unfortunately have to do that uh when we get to the uh question and answer session later in the presentation but i do want to emphasize that becoming a counsellor is taking on a pretty serious role it does demand a lot of your time and as it 's been we 've gone through there is a lot of rules and regulations that become more on your role by virtue of being part of the system of local government so please consider those aspects it 's very rewarding and on a whole range of fronts but you need to be aware that there are certain serious obligations that come with being in the role i just want to talk a little bit about the actual organisation at port stephens council you know how we organize ourselves our organizers organize ourselves to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been structured so if i just move to the next slide um because we are a very diverse organisation we operate some 60 different distinct businesses very uh diverse we have a very diverse set of employees with all different qualifications and backgrounds part-time full-time casual we rely on a lot of volunteers to do a lot of aspects of our role it is a very dynamic and complex organisation because we all come from so many different areas to have a common purpose for the organisation is to deliver services that are valued by our community in the best possible way so we only want to ensure that we deliver services that are adding value to our community we have a ongoing rolling program where we review each and every service to ensure that what we are delivering is adding value to our community if it 's not adding value then why are we doing it the second part of that is we want to deliver it in the best possible way and at port stevens council we use what 's known as the australian business excellence framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for organisational excellence we 've been pursuing that for a dozen years or so um so we are you know to make the most of what we do to be as efficient as we can we 've applied this approach so we want to ensure that not only what we are delivering is adding value to our community as told to us by our community but we are actually delivering it in the best possible way and that service review program has a fairly extensive benchmarking program to ensure that what we do deliver is cost effective and having at the right quality so as an organization why we come to work why we come to do those sort of things is to deliver services that are valued by our community in the best possible way that 's what we do so i 'll take over there so while we might be that you know 60 different business units with diversity and complex complexity to what we do we try to keep our business operating model as simple as we can that is so if you work in a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do and what you know why it 's being structured in that particular way so the group managers are going to talk in a little minute about some of the more specific things but in general we have a four-tier approach we have the general manager 's office which myself our governance manager tony and other staff are in and our key role really is just to keep the organization as online as it can be with all the different areas that we do primarily we take a large role around the governments to make sure that we are doing what we are required to do it in the right way through those various laws and regulations that we oblige to we also have a primary focus on making sure that our elected members can deliver their role as effectively as they can and i know everyone is a little bit different and everyone may have certain requirements and bring different skill sets but our role is to try and assist so we provide strategic leadership right across the organisation and a heavy focus on the governance aspect we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group manager and its role really is to deliver services to the organization itself so instead of everyone trying to do everything like you know having to recruit people and look after the budgets you know and you know everyone going and buying their own computers and all those sort of things we haven 't centralized in the corporate services group where they deliver the services to enable the rest of the organization to go about their business in an effective way so we call that internal service provision that 's providing services internally within our organization next here is our development services group that 's led by our stephen pert so we 'll speak in a minute they 're a bit like the umpire in the middle i like to say is that their role is to enable balanced development but they also manage the compliance and the approval processes as well as a number of other functions so they 're having a role to say yeah stop go in a very simplistic manner the final group there is facility services led by a greek cable and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground services whether that be maintaining roads building new roads running child care running cemeteries external facing directly to the community is where the majority of all those uh services are delivered from so we call that our external uh service delivery team a very basic model but it 's been in place for a number of years now i think when people work at ford students and you tell them this and how it works they get a feel for i know what i 'm doing and i know why i 'm there which is really important providing clarity and purpose for our teams okay because we are part of a government we have a hierarchy or structure in place so that we can ensure that we are delivering you know in courts with the governance and the operational responsibilities i 'll get the group managers i 'll talk specifically about that but we have those three groups plus the general managers area and within each of those groups they have their own various teams that deliver particular services so the next one is the executive and these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct um and facilitate provide their strategic leadership right across our organization so it 's very important that we are on the same page which and we meet regularly to ensure that we do issues come up we try to be a have a consistent approach to how we deal with with things even though some of the you know the functions are very different we 've got to have a very aligned uh leadership approach which we do here at uh at port stephens council they 're the heads of the different teams i 'm going to hand over to those guys um to talk about some of the more specifics only at a higher high level um conversation just so you can get a feel if you 're elected as a counselor on where and why and what we do the things that we do so first tim crosstalk thanks man good evening ladies and gentlemen as wayne said i 'm tim crossland the group manager of corporate services here at port stephen council what i want to do is just take a couple of minutes just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporate services group just to familiarize yourself with the day-to-day day-to-day activities that we undertake on behalf of council so as wayne has mentioned the overall purpose of the corporate services group is to provide internal services and resources to the organisation a lot of that is through centralized functions as mentioned and we 've got that arranged through a number of functions they include our corporate reporting team so they coordinate develop monitor and report on our integrated planning and reporting framework tony had mentioned that previously that exists within the legislation that looks like our community strategic plan which we will work with the incoming council on developing as well as our delivery program and our operational plan annual operational plan the flip side to that is is that we also coordinate the formal reporting of that which includes our six monthly progress reports our annual reporting and our end of term reports within the group is also our strategic property team and they 're charged with managing uh council 's property investment and development projects we manage those in order to provide a non-rate revenue stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions related to investments facilities management and ultimately some development work that we 'll undertake across the lga organisational support is our internal service provider around people all things to do with people data and systems ict how we manage our data digitally our records management as well as business excellence and workforce development across the organisation financial services manage all of council 's financial obligations financial management obligations including revenue expenditure all of our reporting requirements they coordinate our external audit process that we go through annually and also we have a centralized acquisitions or purchasing team that operates on behalf of council finally within the group we also have our holiday park section and they manage council 's beachside holiday park so that 's five holiday park businesses that we have within the lga including the recently opened port stevens koala sanctuary and these businesses are managed to again provide a a non-rate revenue source to council that we can then uh use on uh to fund various infrastructure works uh obviously improvements to the holiday parks themselves and also to support the significant tourism industry imports stephens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be next oh sorry great greg 's next to talk about facilities and services thanks very much thanks tim um good evening ladies and gentlemen um as wayne said earlier i 'm greg cable i 'm the group manager of facilities and services um and in keeping with the group managers approach we have a fairly simple structure under these facilities and services four sections um assets which have work teams involved in engineering services civil assets civil projects community recreation and asset systems we have capital workers that look after survey and design project management construction public domain we look after roadside and drainage roads parks building trades and mechanical maintenance and we also have community services who look after waste volunteers children services emergency management libraries and contracts and services we have for many years explained our existence as a group on a value chain in a very simple value chain in that our asset section go through and identify prioritize and seek funding for the infrastructure that we need across council our capital works team then design and build that infrastructure our public domain team maintains that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure or provides services based on that infrastructure to the community it 's a fairly simple value stream it 's a fairly simple structure that we 've got that delivers assets and infrastructure right across council thank you steve thanks greg good evening ladies and gentlemen stephen hurts my name i 'm the group manager for development services the development services group is an arm of a council that deals a lot with land use planning primarily land use planning and communications we are organized within three distinct sections development assessment and compliance strategy and environment and communications within the development assessment and compliance section we deal daily with a whole range of activities primarily based on new south wales legislation the environmental planning assessment act we have ranger services within that section environmental health services that focuses on food shop and on-site sewage system inspections development assessment so determining da 's building assessment and development compliance so ensuring that people comply with the relevant parts of the legislation and the das that they 're issued with uh just for a fun fact over the last six months the da @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment section we look at long-term land use planning and develop controls that the da team can draw upon as they 're going through their assessment process so within the strategy and environment section we have a strategic land use planning team natural resources so our environmental education vegetation management wheaton pest management areas and economic development and tourism over the last 12 months the team 's been involved in developing a new strategic planning framework working through a new coastal management program and a range of tools in the investment prospectus and concierge areas from a communications section a really important part of what we do and certainly what the new elected representatives would be exposed to we have three business units in that area public relations and marketing they work a lot in the emergency response and media management space customer relations so our front front office the front face of council over the last six months they 've taken around 28 000 calls and our community development and engagement teams really important part of being transparent engaging and collaborating with people in our community around the projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some really good services that are offered there thank you thank you steve um let 's conclude with a few um other specific aspects about um the organization and how it all fits together so to try and keep it as simple as we can we have now how we do and what we do and why we do it all on one page yes it 's a big piece of paper but it sort of sets out exactly how we go about doing things from taking the community 's vision the things that the community would like to see built constructed the services delivered whether that be by council or by other federal or state government agencies we take that or we then operationalize that we turn into an operational plan which is if we 're here for a three or four year term we say we 're going to year one we 're going to do e2 we 're going to go year three we 're going to go year four we apply our business practice approach our values behaviors is very important to as an organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our community with our other key stakeholders and we also apply our business methodology our australian business excellence approach to continuously improving our services from that we undertake a number of specific projects that 's been set out and we finish it off by a review process where every year we need to go back and reassess what we 're doing and how we 're doing it so with the community to make sure that we 're keeping on the same track we use our service review program in one regard we do our annual review of our community plans on the other in a real quick snapshot that 's how what we do with how we 're delivering it sort of fits together and i 'm happy to take many questions on this um label if there 's interest on that so i move on again um we 've spoken a little bit about the integrated planning model that is in place here in new south wales you know from my perspective i 've worked in local government for over 40 years in victoria queensland and now new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ensuring that we take the views of the community in what we deliver what council will deliver what council will advocate to other government agencies or the state or federal levels for those services that the community wants to see done this is a very uh dynamic process when we when the new council is elected as it might have already been indicated by uh by tonya and tim that first thing the council needs to do is to go out amongst the community and ascertain what what does the community want to see done to make their life import stephens for the better and often it 's we want better public transport or we want better health services or we want uh you know better policing or we want to you know do a whole range of things that may not be council 's role that 's where we advocate for but there is a lot of things that we have a direct touch with our community on for example um the state of our local road network which has been severely impacted of course by the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the views back from the community in that to develop what is called the community strategic plan the council takes what it will do over its term and this next term will be for three years so what are we actually going to bite off and deliver over those three years there 's a process around council deciding that and then we operationalize it with our operational plan we 're gonna do year one year two year three year four how we 're going to afford it we have to prepare what 's called a resourcing strategy which includes primarily you know making sure we 've got the money to finance but a 10-year financial plan we need to make sure that we have the right workforce to deliver those services where they have to have a workforce plan and then most importantly for local government we look after a billion dollars worth of infrastructure assets we haven 't have to have a strategic asset management plan to see how we can maintain those services uh and the facilities that we do this all comes together into these integrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report back to our community on the delivery of what we said we were going to do and we 're required to provide six monthly reports back to our community against these key targets and activities that we said we would do according to our operational plans and our community strategic plan and that 's a big cycle every year that needs to be reviewed and every year we need to produce a final annual report that goes out to the community on our finances and all our activities so it is a very very comprehensive and a very sophisticated process and i think that a really solid one to keep the organization and the elected council honest with its community because there 's not nothing to hide there it all comes out in those uh in those reports and they 're all audited um so pretty good process but you 'll certainly learn a lot more about that now a big focus on um local government and this this was the the catalyst for the mergings or proposed mergers of local government councils um previously was about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government they reviewed and said well you know are the councils uh sustainable in their own right to actually deliver and maintain the assets and services that they have or you know could a better bigger council do more or a smaller smaller council perhaps the key indicators there were did you have the financial capacity to deliver what the community wants to see delivered are you of a certain size do you have the scale and capacity to deliver on a on an efficient basis those services and infrastructure how are you managing your assets are you managing your assets or are they deteriorating and there 's no plan in place to actually maintain the assets to a workable uh conditional and of course the final factor which is not the least important program the most important is is council meeting its obligations in terms of all the various legislation regulations and the governance requirements that is placed on us in our role as part of the level of government that 's they 're called the fit for the future uh um program that still applies to us we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the decisions that we that we make when we go out to a community we will have many many requests and we know there 's many things that we would the community would love to see done but when you put into the context of affordability great revenues of you know the potential grants fees and charges that 's affordable um it really pairs things back and that 's where the uh the tough decisions have to get made by the elected council about where do we put these resources while we might have a budget of over a hundred million dollars which sounds a real lot um we are so finely balancing delivering what we can do with that amount versus what the community wants it is a constant ongoing challenge so as a new counsellor certainly you 'll be faced with these issues around uh affordability uh the rating structures and you know our overall finances balanced against what 's best for our community and what we what we put our focus into so again we have to report about how we are going as an organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um you know workforce very to our services we 've come up with seven key metrics that apply right across our organization we measure these uh every year and report on these every year the first one is community satisfaction what does the actual community think about the services that council delivers for on their behalf so we do this that do we do this annually um and we measure the results that we get we 've measured the feedback that we get in about this is good or that 's bad it should do this we should do that we analyze that and that helps influence what we do in the following year of service but community satisfaction is a really key metric likewise is our employee engagement we measure the engagement of our employees we know from all research that you know satisfied happy uh staff with the right equipment the right leadership certainly outperformed and are more efficient than councils where that 's not in place so we do measure our employee engagements a very important measure that we do we have another of other measures because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years back our financial position uh was not so good as it is today and uh as a consequence we couldn 't maintain our facilities very well uh we had a lot of dissatisfaction in terms of the community and our staff once we had that put back on track by primarily through our service review program and asking the community what they really value we managed to get ourselves on track and we have a lot better results so financial management we budget for a one percent underlying surplus we always budget for a surplus one percent in a hundred million dollars it might sound a lot uh it 's not only try to manage your own household budget to within one percent very very particularly in the in the ski that we work in we know we face natural disasters all the time which damage our road network which are very expensive items etc so financial management 's another key metric that we report on and i know it gets a lot of interest um from our community the next one is delivery on our integrated plans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that book so we measure the achievement we have on that and we generally have a very high achievement because of our structures in place um risk health and safety the risk to the public risk to the safety of the public the safety of our employees again is a very important metric that we monitor right across our organisation and report against um governance you know again talking about how are we meeting our governance obligations you know are we following the right things are we doing the right rules how many breaches may we have very strict measurement around that and reporting on that and finally but certainly not least is all about our infrastructure we measure here what 's called an infrastructure backlog that might be infrastructure that has been passed by its useful life and may not be fit for purpose anymore we 've been working very hard to try and reduce that infrastructure backlog but unfortunately uh we still do have uh quite a you know a number of million dollars in an infrastructure backlog which is where it comes back to that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against those metrics now you 're joining council i 've been working in locomotive 40 years i really say this every year that well this is a challenging period it really certainly is we 're in the midst we 've been through and we 're going through again about a government reform agenda always seems to be that it 's local government that 's being tried to be reformed we have very high level of expectation within our community in our different localities it 's certainly uh that 's something we can only expect to keep growing about services that we do deliver and the quality of those services and the costs that we deliver them um being in local government um being a local uh that you are under the eye of everyone you face high scrutiny the good the bad thing different we will be told all about it particularly now with social media so prevalent in our communities that we get a lot of feedback on those things and often they don 't sort of attract you know the the type of people that are really willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm saying that politely a technological revolution um you know the way we deliver our services is really really changing quickly a few years ago we wouldn 't have even probably known about drones and you know equipment that can be operated without any staff intervention a whole range of robotics and things that are all becoming um part of our workforce so changing that with our our aged population which reflects on our age workforce is a big challenge to work with but also one for potential you know better efficiencies and delivery which saves the bottom line um worldwide there 's a there 's a skilled global shortage on skilled workers and we 're no different here because we have very many different fields of expertise we 're often struggling and often in the local governments in the hunter which there 's ten of we 're often competing with each other for the best of staff like to think we 've done really really well here at port stephens council but it is always a constant challenge spoken already a bit about our rate caps and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council i can i can be sure that you know the issue of a rate rise will be something that we talked about because the impacts on what services can be delivered anyway that won 't be for me to decide on that and there 's always a mandate to do more with less that 's been non-constant for many many years but it 's it 's nonetheless challenging but the good thing is that um you know the way the organization has uh has pulled together the way we operate the efficiencies that we have put we 're in a really good place certainly many many challenges i know there 's certainly many many things we could probably do better more efficiently more effectively but we are in a really good place to meet those challenges that are outlined and probably many others that that you 'll face over your uh term as an elected councillor so i 'm now going to hang over to tony just to get very specific here about some of the uh the electoral milestones for we haven 't talked you out of running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll conclude and then we 'll have a q a session we 'll hand over to you thanks wayne um just so the candidates are clear um councillors uh decided that we would have the new south wales electoral commission um facilitate and run the election for us the 2020 local government election uh and to do that obviously there are a number of key dates that are quite important we have on the screen for you some of the key dates to hit but obviously there is more information on the new south wales electric commission 's website in relation to key dates certainly starting from next monday we will uh see the candidates uh nomination open and the close of the uh the roles including the non-residence uh and rat pace roll um you will on that particular day as well you 'll see the election office open here in raymond terrace and you 'll have access to a retaining officer on the 27th uh postal vote applications will open followed by the 4th of august we will see closer candidate nominations at 12 p.m or 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that particular day [Music] the following day on the 5th of august we 'll have the the returning officer will conduct the ballot draw and then following on from that later in the month on the 23rd of august i will have pre-poll and i vote applications will open as well uh the 27th of august registration and uh sorry of electoral material will close at 5 pm uh so you 'll have those times from the 4th to the 27th of august uh to conduct that business with the returning officer on the 30th august we 'll see postal vote applications close at 5 00 pm and obviously pre-poll will close on the 3rd of september the day prior friday the 3rd of september prior to election day on the 4th of september election day i 'm pretty sure most people would be aware that election day runs from 8 p 8 a.m to 6 p.m at the polling booths that will be provided on the newspaper 's electoral commission 's website uh only over the last week or so a number of the dates have changed post the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission have released those dates uh and like as i said uh they are included on their website they include the um uh the dates been pushed out for the return of completed postal vote certificates uh normally that would happen immediately after the election uh on monday it 's been pushed out somewhat and also the distribution and the declaration of results uh has been pushed out to uh the dates between the 21st and the 23rd of september uh so that 's a little different in past years a number of these changes have been result of how the elections will be conducted due to coven so you can appreciate why some of these dates are being pushed out and opportunities i 'm sure pre-poll but also postal votes will see an increase in this election um just some key locations that will be across the local government area i mentioned the election office will open next week um pretty much directly i 'll diagonally across from the police station in william street so 42 uh william street raymond terrace and that venue will also double up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nelson bay area we 'll have a pre-poll location as well and that will be at the catholic church hall uh the next couple of slides really from have been provided to us from the new surprise electoral commission to provide to candidates if we were holding such an event throughout this evening um i apologize for the number of characters on the screens but it was important to convey exactly what the commission have provided to us so as i 've mentioned the key dates are on their website um certainly how candidates can nominate again there is a wealth of information on their website but certainly make sure that you check those key dates those applications have been open online so nomination while i 've said nomination opens um soon that 's uh the in-person nominations with the returning officer um but online nominations and their management system has been around since uh the 28th of june um so your nominations and deposits uh must be lodged between the 26th of july and 12 noon on the 4th of august um and be very clear that late nominations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important the candidates it 's important canada 's responsibility to ensure that they 're full and the correct completed nomination form and the relevant nomination deposit is received by place of business um so i 'd probably encourage people not to leave it until um ten minutes prior to closing the nomination just in case there is a an issue found with your nomination papers uh we go on to the next slide in relation to expenditure and political donations again visit the commission 's website and you will certainly see the full disclosure of information that 's required there it 's quite a lengthy process to go through and i won 't go through the total slide on the screen i 'll leave you to read that in late date in relation to the next slide it 's really just a bit of a help sheet um as to where you can go uh to find additional information speak to someone if you 're not clear on something uh and obviously there 's a number of avenues there being telephone on their hotline of 1300.0201 all through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website now the commission have had a candidate 's handbook available since late april uh so i 'd encourage people if you haven 't already done so just download that and have a look at that um resource the last slide before i head back to wayne for us to take questions is really just a further information you can certainly go to our website we 've got an electoral information page on the court students council site the office of local government have a lot of information there about becoming a counselor being a counsellor time commitment and so forth there is a handbook there for councillors um that i would encourage people to read um it is quite lengthy but it does give you a complete understanding of what the role of the counsellor is the commission 's website obviously the electoral funding and disclosures information is available on their website as well i would encourage people to have a look at the australian level government women 's association website as well and certainly we 're advocating that you know we 're looking to increase participation not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and another handy resource he 's certainly like new south wales um website thank you wayne all right thanks again tony um it 's going to be the delicate part of the uh the use of the technologies um any questions uh that you may have uh we 'll take uh either through our chat line or we 'll turn on the system so you can talk directly uh to us and we 'll do our best to either provide a you know a response or to direct you where you 'll be able to find the information well tony 's uh sorting that through um again i just want to emphasize that now being a counselor is is a very rewarding role but it is very challenging and there 's a lot of obligations as we 've probably outlined but we 've only really skimmed the surface if you 're elected we do have a very detailed uh induction process to bring you up to speed with you know the nitty-gritty of what council does all the various issues that are going on right across our different communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know to get look and feel with uh some of the services that uh that port stephens council delivers to its community so it is a very detailed uh induction process which will take some time to get through it will certainly hopefully put you in a better mode for when you are in the council chamber having to make any decisions here we also have a pretty good professional development program for council it 's really important that councillors keep up-to-date contemporary knowledge about things just the legislation is constantly changing and they put through local government new south wales which is the uh organization that helps elect members and helps to lobby to the state and federal they offer a lot of great programs um we also know that the people who are who have done the australian institute company directors course get a lot of benefit particularly around governance um particularly around finance and risk management aspects it 's a highly um recommended program and i know a number of our existing counselors have have been through that and found that you know of great benefit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to tell you we uh almost got already got any questions from any members of the audience silence or it 's not working no there 's nothing in the chat nothing in the chat right well i won 't uh prolong things but if you do come up with things if you find that you know you want to know a bit more about this or that you know other than the context that tony has uh has put up there about some specific things ronnie we 're available to help and i know chinese you know offers a lot of good help and good advice around the governance areas and some of the technicalities about that of course myself and the uh the other group managers are readily available to try and outline and clarify any prospective candidates about how bill stephens operates and why we do the things we do and you know obviously willing to take uh suggestions and opportunities to improve how we go about our business so again i apologize that we 've had to do it in this format it 's much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we can interact more positively and you know get some some feedback going but unfortunately this is the world we 're living in at the moment um you know the process is is challenging uh and the circumstances are you know not ideal but hopefully that what we 've outlined today is of some benefit to help you make your decision about running for council and some of the obligations that you have so on behalf of our team here i 'll say thank you this will be put up on our website this recording um and if you listen to this as a recorded thing and you still have some questions or whatever please uh feel free to contact the council so thank you very much"

    "text": "hello and thank you for joining us today to hear an update on the draft waste management strategy my name is alex eupedes and courtney williams will also be presenting the strategy today [Music] the purpose of today 's presentation is to give you a quick introduction to who telus consultants are provide your background on the project provide you an update on the status of the waste management strategy provide an overview of the telephone survey and the key findings discuss the key themes and initiatives that came from the telephone survey provide details on further community engagement and provide an indicative timeline for the completion of the project [Music] talus consultants is a multi-disciplinary company with services in asset management noise environment spatial engineering and of course waste [Music] we provide end-to-end waste management services including strategic infrastructure design waste auditing procurement contracts and construction supervision so we 'd like to think that we know what we 're talking about when it comes to waste management it 's a bit of a project background since 1999 council has had a two-bin system where the red lid bin has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned into a product called mixed waste organics outputs or m-word for short and is used to rehabilitate mining forestry and agricultural land a recent decision by the new south wales epa was to revoke the exemption of using that product and applying it to land and as a result council 's current waste collection and processing system is unable to produce a suitable landfill diversion result council is currently in discussions with suez in the epa around possible options going forward with that facility however to ensure council makes the best decision long term it is essential that a long-term strategy is developed so this strategy will look at areas covering the short medium and longer term and will focus on these five key areas municipal solid waste management dry recycling management problem waste recycling we 'll have production targets and we 'll look at the facilities that are required both now and into the future to manage waste and recycling the strategy will address how council can meet the current targets set by the new south wales epa and future targets as the strategy evolves identify opportunities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils do identify opportunities for council to utilize waste assets and resources in the most efficient manner to maximise recovery identify opportunities to reduce waste to landfills through the recycling of additional material either through the procuring of waste technology or the use of alternative processing options the strategy will deliver improvements for council and residents in regards to waste avoidance reduction and resource recovery possible regional cooperation coordination service delivery and of course have a strong element of community education so so far what has been done on the way strategy well we undertook a project inception meeting with council and talus and we discussed the goals and objectives for the strategy and what we wanted achieved we undertook site visits at the salamander bay transfer station along with suez 's resource recovery park at new line road we then undertook a thorough desktop review assessing all the information that council has but also what 's available from a regional perspective and also the state perspective to give us a good understanding of council 's current situation regarding waste management we then developed a telephone survey and from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Music] so the telephone survey analyzed the current behaviors preferences and levels of support for council 's new waste strategy we targeted 400 completed responses in each of those 400 responses were picked at complete random and as a result they the results were representative and quantitative allowing us to truly be confident in the results of what the community thought and felt about waste management [Music] as you can see the samples came evenly and this again was reassuring to know that we had sampled a diverse range across the council area so the survey started with a series of questions about current behaviors and the current services provided by council we looked at the capacity of the curbside bins at time of presentation the frequency of curbside bin presentation and the preferred frequency of curbside bin collection and size of curbside bins we then asked about the method of disposing of items whether or not the community were using just the curbside bins or were they using salamander bay transfer station as well along with that were they using council 's free garden organics and recycling drop-off days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the following waste management ideals and concepts so did they support minimizing the environmental social and economic impacts of littering encouraging waste avoidance and reused behaviors to help generate less waste expansion of waste and recycling education programs to the community increasing recycling by recovering food and garden organics increasing the range of recycling options for community and businesses developing markets for the reuse repair and reselling of waste and prohibiting the use of single-use plastics at the end of the survey participants were then asked to detail one future waste management priority which was an open-ended question giving the resident the opportunity to provide any further information that they felt necessary the outcomes from the survey led to the formulation of the following themes and initiatives which will be considered during the development of the strategy and courtney will go through those in detail now [Music] the first thing an initiative relates to the kerbside collection service council is looking at the introduction of alternative sizes of waste and recycling bins including the option of a 140 litre we feel the council needs to promote the availability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents were unaware that this service was available introduction of a third kerbside bin for the collection of garden organics or food guard food organics and garden organics and consider the trend the transitioning to a user pay bulky waste collection service we are also requesting that council consider the number of drop-off days for garden organics and problem wastes there was strong support for the implementation of a council-supported anti-littering campaign and to run in conjunction with that we are recommending the council review the locations and collection frequencies of their current public place litter bins there was interest in the implementation of a local ban on single-use plastics and did to support that there would need to be an education campaign for both businesses and residents as well as visitors that come to your area [Music] we are recommending that council introduce a sustainable events policy that requires the use of recyclable or compostable packaging and saw separation of waste collected at [Music] events there is a need to consider the expansion of materials collected at the salamanda bay transfer station to include items such as soft plastics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that responded to the survey to introduce and promote additional education campaigns including reuse upcycling and repair workshops as well as greater promotion of materials accepted at the salamander bay transfer station and promotion of anti-literary programs single-use plastic ban and sustainable events policies if those initiatives were to be implemented [Music] in terms of further community engagement there is an online forum to be held on wednesday the 25th of november from 5 30 to 6 30 through facebook live there is also an online survey that 's currently available on council 's have your say website where residents will have the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed themes and initiatives so everyone is encouraged to visit the website and respond to that survey in terms of the project timeline as you can see we 're in the community engagement phase at the moment there will be an options report prepared for council which will include a number of preferred themes and initiatives to be rolled out it will lead to the development of a draft strategy which will be the community facing strategy document and council will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in june next year with the final document being adopted in july of next year thank you for your time"

    "text": "[Music] hi I 'm Sarah Smith councillor for Central Ward in Port Stephens council I 've lived in Port Stephens for almost ten years and I also own a cafe located right on the beach at Berube in Anna Bay hi my name is Leah Anderson and I 'm the president of primary business chamber today we 're talking about partnerships with local industry and community and we 're going to go through some examples of how we 've delivered some vibrancy across and placemaking across town centres and we 've got some great examples to run through with that today [Music] Port Stephens is a wonderful area located approximately two and a half hours north of Sydney and about 45 minutes from our largest regional City which is Newcastle we have a wide variety of key industries employing many of the 71 thousand people who call Port Stephens home these include manufacturing defense and aviation and tourism Port Stephens is made up of a combination of local areas and a cluster of small village like locations as well port settings Council adopted a new economic development strategy in 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating an environment that allows Council to support business growth drive the visitor economy and inject vibrancy into our whole community which benefits everyone so I 'm lucky enough to live in beautiful Nelson Bay and have done so for the past 15 years but Nelson Bay is a very popular tourist destination as most people know and we 've got a really strong sense of community here the Tom Murray Business Chamber has quite a large rate we work closely with Council to align with their economic development strategy to deliver on on initiative so making vibrant town centres and adjoining business and community work together to deliver those with council is one of our key initiatives so in 2017 our one of our local business groups called Nelson Bay now approach the Tom Murray Business Chamber and we had discussions around how tired the the town center was looking in that it was what we thought was in desperate need of some sort of a makeover we talked to Port Stephens Council and engage with the economic development unit and they 'd had some previous discussions with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrant spaces from those discussions we managed to get a guest speaker down from mid north Council to talk at one of our business chamber breakfasts and they talked about how the business local business and community can work together to create some some magic in the town centers and it didn 't have to wait for a strategic planning document to come off a shelf to actually have that happen our community got very excited about the year the thought of such a concept and so we had volunteers literally knocking at our door saying can we do something in Nelson Bay so from that we formed the Nelson based civic pride community group and that community group was a group of passionate locals and and business owners who wanted to see us make some sort of a difference in in the Nelson Bay town center so working jointly with Port Stephens Council and working on a particular project plan that we build ourselves I guess with council over a couple of months on the 27th of May 2018 72 volunteers turned up in the Nelson Bay town center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B you 've ever seen on the Tom Murray peninsula after the the working B day we realized there was going to be some ongoing maintenance required of those gardens so the business chambers spoke to the local businesses that had gardens situated at the front of their business and we talked to them about the idea of adopting that local garden and paying something like 50 a year to have a little sign that we 've got the Men 's Shed to build so you know garden proudly sponsored by this local business and we encouraged them to maintain that garden to water it to plant flowers in there and to assist the the volunteers of the civic pride group who continually maintain the gardens but just to help so it 's been a great initiative but it gives the businesses some real ownership and buying of making the area outside of their shop front look really nice so with the community and businesses coming together to do such a thing as our our huge working B for the day I think not only that the pride that everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at the end of the day of what had been achieved there 's also a sense of bye you know I guess an ownership of maintaining that ongoing and I think that 's the brilliant thing about having the community get involved in in such an activity is we 're not sitting back now and relying on Port Stephens Council to turn up and and maintain our gardens and and and make it look beautiful and continue to look lovely for our locals and our tourists it 's about us getting in there and and their own pride in being able to maintain that work and continue to make a town look beautiful so the group of civic pride volunteers are just an absolutely wonderful passionate group and they 're really forged a strong relationship with the Port Stephens council since our big working working bee day they 've also organised little mini working bees they contact Council when things need to be done like when chairs need to be painted or Gardens need a little bit of extra love and attention that they they need some support with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said formed a really strong bond with the with the council and when things are needed to be done they certainly work together to get them done beautiful Sunday morning here in Nelson Bay we 've got an amazing amount of volunteers here there 's such a great vibe around here of everyone working in gardens painting weeding removing chewing gum off the ground it 's just a bunch of locals wanted to get in and clean up our town and make it a nice a nice place to live a nice place for us to sit down another cup of coffee and look around at some bad-looking gardens and I think importantly as well for our tourists when they come into town [Music] we had people turning up a quarter to seven all dressed up and ready to go you know I mean in their gardening gear and it was just amazing to see people excited to come down and to help out and and yeah do the work it 's good great to see so many different people from different walks of life all working together with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor of this town to see so many people out here supporting each other I mean the name of the group civic pride is certainly what is showing this morning key focus of councils economic development and tourism plan is building relationships and creating connections this strategy focuses on four key areas driving economic growth increasing overnight visitors spend making business growth easier and importantly creating people friendly spaces Council is unable to make these things happen by themselves we need good working relationships with businesses and the local community particularly organizations like our local business chamber the Tom Murray Business Chamber destination port Stevens Council has an economic development and tourism panel and part ownership in the Newcastle Airport the council is acutely aware that we cannot deliver these changes on our own there needs to be genuine partnership from the business community and this creates sustainability which is very important in keeping any initiatives that we undertake going to into the future [Music] the Port Stephens council really understands the value of place making this is making spaces in our across our LGA more livable and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for this we need to create a great place and reflect the culture and identity of our community we 've all seen great plans for town centers and cities and public spaces that are printed out and sit on a shelf for years and nothing ever happens and what we want to see is these ideas coming to life and projects really getting off the ground a lot of the time the best placemaking outcomes occur when there is little or limited budget and this is very important in showing that we can make a lot happen with little resources the seven-day makeover process has been carried out in numerous towns in Australia and New Zealand and it all starts with getting the community to invest and commit to making these changes in their town so there 's two days of workshops and planning is the start of the process everyone comes up with their projects and their budget and then on the third day you move into actually picking up a shovel and a hammer and really getting started on your projects in your town and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a party at the end and the makeover in Anna Bay saw record numbers of people come out and volunteer their time and people saying things like I 've never volunteered before but I love this I 'm going to keep coming and what other projects can I be involved in and that was exactly the type of response that we wanted because we wanted the community to invest in this project and the other way that they invested was by actually donating money Council made a financial contribution to the project but then the community raised money and that made a really big difference in people 's commitment level which is great to see so this seven-day makeover is really just a starting point for the town of Anna Bay at the moment but the concept can also be rolled out across other areas and it doesn 't have to be a big seven-day thing every time the idea is that people keep working on smaller projects and just keep making small improvements over a long period of time so here in Anna bait today we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group to generate a community lead makeover of so it all started last Saturday at about 30 with a workshop working out what we were going to do and everyone 's been working so hard all week and now we 're here seeing the end result and Bay is an important town in the Port Stephens LGA with a really really passionate community and we 're harnessing that that passion which is demonstrated here today with all the volunteers making and painting and sanding and building really putting their blood sweat and tears into improving the community improving the Township for orbit for themselves and their family there 's long been a perception that anime has been the poor cousin of Port Stephens so this was a big thing to just change that attitude and get just get people to invest and get people involved and take that ownership and particularly see what we 've achieved this week in such a short time we can do so much more and I 'll certainly be driving that in whatever way I can [Music] the council have recognized for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anime community were very vocal in standing up for their own their own community which is fantastic to see and the seven-day makeover is the start of an ongoing program to deliver improved infrastructure and a bay into the anime community the seven-day makeover program is being led by Paul Stevens council but it the ideas and all the work that are being generated is coming from the community themselves this crew the seven-day make a of the crew that came in and helped us well we wouldn 't have been able to do it without them pick guess that was the fun part that we had the say on what we could do they worked out with Council what we couldn 't couldn 't do and then it was just up to us to be as creative as we wanted to be so that was good being part of that but yeah we wouldn 't have been able to do it without the seven-day makeover crew they were fantastic really good to work with living here for so long and so many people I don 't know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close-knit community and the amount of people you see in the orange vests walking around is a quite amazing so it 's a nice community I 'm volunteering and contributing even if you can only do an hour or two but you get a feeling of contribution and doing something that 's outside of yourself and a normal routine of everyday life I think it 's just just being a part of it and everybody else feeling the same just giving and and you can see the momentum it creates momentum this has been absolutely Oh overwhelming great thanks to the council for giving us a grant or some money so we can get this project moving all these shops and businesses around here have also put money in individuals have put money in what I love about this project in particular it 's not just people from Anna Bay it 's the whole community and it 's so important it 's all generations here we 've seen people just even on their crutches and broken arms we 're all coming to help we can all give a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important to Anna Bay it 's important to Port Stephens Council as a community development project everyone 's helping each other out people are really enthused really excited people are donating time they 're donating materials they 're donut donating skills and I think everyone 's going to get a real buzz when projects are complete this will show other areas right across port stephens that we can do similar things in other towns roman terrace medalie so many areas could pick up this model and do a similar thing and i think it 's going to have that wider benefit once people see it they will they just will be blown away and want to get involved [Music] okay so another recent initiative that we worked on jointly we put Stevens council without was our Christmas festival motion what we decided to do was to try and engage with our local community to shop local and to support our local businesses so with a very limited shoestring budget the Business Chamber got together with councils economic development unit and thought about what could we do so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very limited amount of time we came up with a Christmas shopping program so that program ran over a couple of weeks and we had two late-night shopping nights in Nelson Bay which we wouldn 't normally do at that time of year we engage with a local center to wander around the town and to bring the kids in we had kids performing dancing on the stage and trying to create a really wonderful nice atmosphere but most importantly to encourage people to do business locally and to shop locally so to assist us to understand exactly what impact economically that the shop local campaign would have for us for having our our Christmas trading festive season the council provided us with some research into what spending a dollar locally would bring to our local economy what we learnt was for every hundred dollars spent in a small business in Port Stephens sixty dollars of that one hundred dollars stays locally whereas in comparison if people were to shop online and spend a hundred dollars only a dollar three dollars fifty would be staying in the local economy so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message out there that shopping locally would make a significant difference to our local businesses and the economic benefit that that would bring rather than jumping online and shopping online so after the Christmas promotion the local traders really did start to form a closer working relationship and there 's been some discussions around looking at having other late-night after-hours trading for our local local businesses which is a great initiative and it 's good to see that them taking those on board themselves so we 're looking forward to seeing what programs were all out in the CBD across the coming year what we offer I think is we 're very personable we really get to know our customers what we offer is genuine and that 's the way that we deal with our customers as well is that what you see is what you get from us being a resident since 1960 of Ray material it 's a great community as it turns out we probably are the oldest ongoing business with the same ownership I honestly feel like I 've always wanted this space to feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our customers like family it 's just a different engagement and you can 't really do that in other communities local is extremely important they have what we have built this business on I 've work in the terrace I have lunch in the terrace every day I had coffee in the terrace every day so by keeping million business there 's 10 regular companies that I frequent chops they 've been in business it all flows in together it 's very connected my bookkeeper has lunch at my accountant has lunch here I really love it when you spend 100 at our shops across sports Stevens we know that 60 if that stays in our local community and flows on to other businesses as well helps find my family my staff 's families and it then just the bro one goes from there especially when my staff for locals keep some money in the area it 's the choice that coming by involved quickly but it 's the locals that keep you here year-round I 'd say to anyone that 's looking to do some Christmas shopping get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have make sure you check it out this Christmas song in 2019 Port Stephens council receives in funding to redevelop Apex Park this is a central area in the town of Nelson Bay that connects the township to the waterfront the area needed a lot of cosmetic work but also redesigned to make it more user-friendly and able to host very different styles of events as part of the opening of Apex Park we wanted to show the community and as many people as possible how this space could be used and one of the things that came out of that was a four-day Tom Murray Arts Festival so the local art community got involved we had displays in the park there were local schools involved there was street performers there was food music and it really opened up the area to a lot of people who probably hadn 't been in there before 2019 Port Stephens council facilitated something called the Fern Bay Fiesta Fern Bay is a small area bordering on the Newcastle local government area and for several years staff have been working on a new strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that it 's hard to get people excited about reading through an actual strategy pages and pages of information but we also wanted to make sure that we conducted the most effective community consultation that we could for the people who live in this area it 's a very fast-growing area lots of families they need more infrastructure and we wanted to reach out to as many of those people as we could so Council held a food truck event on a Friday night and basically just engaged with the community in their own backyard and it was very very well received so in summary from our presentation today we hope that you get a really good feeling and understanding for how if we work together when we bring business local community and work together without our local councils that we can really make some difference and and go a long way towards rejuvenating and revitalizing our town centers"

vexing issue in our society despite everything we know there are many mysteries that remain and addiction is still quite a human condition so whilst this may help you to navigate the system and to work out where you should be putting your efforts with your loved one it by no means answers some of the many issues that we face when dealing with people with addiction in this uh first talk i propose to look at the criteria for addiction what what how to recognize addiction uh look at the um the brain and habit formation uh how substances produce addiction and and who is at risk of addiction and recognizing this stage that diction not only applies to substances but also certain behaviors such as gambling gaming and internet uh addiction possibly also applies to uh sexual addiction and pornography uh buying or shopping addiction work aholism uh even exercise and possibly uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the key the key features of addiction in the in the latest manual of diagnostic uh psychiatric diagnoses there are 11 criteria listed for addiction and i 've like to group these into into three groups which makes it easier to understand and conceptualize but the first group of symptoms that indicate addiction would be a loss of control of substance use and this may be indicated by when someone goes to use a substance they end up using a lot more and for a longer than they intended another feature might be that despite knowing the harm it 's causing physically and psychologically uh a person will continue to use it and despite certain adverse social situations like disinhibition and possibly embarrassment people continue to use it and also repeated attempts to cut down unsuccessfully so these are symptoms of loss of control the second group of symptoms which indicate addiction is really about problems that arise from addiction and objective evidence of those problems these could be such things as hazardous use of um use in hazardous situations such as uh driving um smoking in uh public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and um and that sort of thing other objective evidence of problems might be neglect of roles and responsibilities such as parenting work roles etc then there 's uh there may be problems with interpersonal relationships that is social problems arising and uh and then just the sheer amount of time that people a person might spend obtaining the drug or substance using it and recovering so these are objective evidence of problems associated with substance use and then there 's the the third category which i call subjective issues subjective feelings which include the feeling of craving and craving could be could be described as having a feeling for the substance that is overpowering that you can 't think of anything else at the time until that feeling is satiated other other symptoms that other feelings that people may have is that the drug doesn 't give the same effect so there 's a greater quantity needed for the same effect that 's called tolerance and that going without the drug can cause in if you like reverse of the symptoms that the drug causes so that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prescribed drugs which obviously can do the same sort of thing people can require a larger quantity of say a sedative or an antidepressant for it to achieve the optimal effect and people can have withdrawal symptoms from those prescribed medications so this third group does not apply to a prescribed medication and for for the criteria of addiction to be or a substance use disorder is the latest terminology uh to be uh uh considered present at least two symptoms uh would constitute a mild uh a mild addiction or a mild substance use disorder and uh around about four would be would be moderate six would start to be in this severe category so what i 'd like to try to get you to understand through this next uh series of slides is the is the brain 's tendency to habit formation and how that is an actually a normal process that substances tend to hijack we look also look at brain regions and how the how substances affect various brain regions and their role in addiction the first section i 'm going to just play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know intrinsically is associative learning that is we tend to associate things that occur together which seems quite obvious but it 's a very very important um part of our brain 's function so i 'll just play this short video goes for a couple of minutes pavlov a noted russian scientist won the nobel prize for physiology and medicine in 1904 as this original footage shows pavlov was initially interested in digestion and the action of the salivary glands by diverting the saliva of dogs into test tubes he could precisely measure if and how much they salivated during digestion when food was presented the dog salivated quickly and inherited salivary reflex but over repeated testings a strange thing happened the dogs salivated before contact with the food just the side of the food was enough to stimulate their drooling then just seeing the food dish or even hearing the footsteps of pavlov or his assistance was enough to trigger this built-in reflex what was going on to elicit this response pavlov decided to find out by systematically varying the stimuli and measuring the dog 's reaction metronomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all worked as stand-ins for the food what mattered was not the kind of stimulus that was used but the fact that it reliably signaled that food was on the way pavlov had discovered a fundamental type of learning called classical conditioning an original stimulus elicits an automatic unlearned response both stimulus and response happen naturally they are unconditioned then a second neutral stimulus that never elicits the unconditioned response by itself is introduced just before the presentation of the original stimulus [Music] if the neutral or signaling stimulus is presented alone and response occurs as if the original stimulus was still there we say that conditioning has taken place the arbitrary neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus the reverse is also true pavlov and others study the extinction over time of such conditioned responses when the subject learns that the conditioned stimulus no longer signals a desired event the acquisition process is reversed as the learned connection is gradually weakened so so this video is um it may seem irrelevant but it 's actually quite important in understanding addiction and understanding what triggers people to seek drugs and importantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquiring of a learned association but the gradual fading out of that learned association over time let 's look at that in how that applies to to humans or animals so we have a basic need such as thirst and naturally drinking water feels feels good that creates a good feeling uh that is not a something you need to learn we when we drink water we get a natural surge of feeling good but in order to survive we would have to learn where that water comes from and so through observation at the time of uh of drinking water uh the person or the animal or person may see that a tap is involved and the surroundings involved involving a tap and so when the person is thirsty in the future they are attracted to the tap so the trap tap itself becomes an attraction so when a person is thirsty they they look for a tap it seems too obvious to be worth mentioning but this is a powerful mechanism in the brain which uh which we all need to survive and these these this mechanism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so and we 'll see that how substances can hijack those chemical substances those chemical processes the other thing about associate is the association is the acquisition of learning so for example again taking that idea of of thirst as the basic uh the basic need a tap is present so a child may have seen somebody turning the tap on or just may have just started doing trial and error turning the tap on gets water gets the thirst relieved that pleasure and that reinforces that behavior so this this illustrates a very fundamental type of learning in in the brain not a high level learning but a very basic learning about which is involved with survival which involves an activator such as such as thirst a behavior which can be experimentally learned or just uh observed and a consequence which will be either a reinforcing or a a negating consequence that consequence then reinforces the behaviour if it resulted in a pleasure and that is then tends to keep that behavior going in future this boat this mechanism of reinforcing behaviours is mediated through dopamine chemical in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in nature an example from from uh from nature uh a lion experiences hunger it 's it 's observed a behavior with its uh with its parents or its uh other lines that waiting near a water hole at sunset catches prey i 'm just assuming that 's how they do it and and the result is that hunger is satisfied and that causes a surge of dopamine in the brain that reinforces that behavior and without that without that basic mechanism of of acquiring associations and learning behaviors uh we simply wouldn 't survive animals wouldn 't survive in nature and this applies to a lot of our basic needs not just hunger and thirst but safety and also reproduction uh it 's obviously not as simple as as life isn 't as simple as just having uh having an urge uh meeting that with a certain behavior and then without some sort of modification of that whole system and that 's where uh the smart brain comes in so this this kind of learning happens at a very basic uh level in the brain which is common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more sophisticated animals behavior is the more important is that other factors kind of moderate that that those basic uh triggers and the basic uh behaviors otherwise uh you know we would uh take a dislike to someone and just go and you know attack them uh or um or just uh take what we wanted without consideration of other people so going on from there we 're just going to talk about the brain and the smart brain and the and the animal brain so we have a part of our brain which is uh a fairly uh prototypical part of the brain called the limbic system or the and i like to call it the animal brain and then a more advanced part of the brain if you like as modifications have occurred which is the cerebral cortex and the very front part of this is called the frontal lobe parts of the cerebral cortex vision occur here on the other side of that is motor and speech that is movement and speech coordination also in that part is to do with spatial planning all these kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is uh is a is where our highest level of uh of thinking occurs uh the frontal lobe is really say the executive in an organization um so just say you were going to catch a ball a ball was coming towards you your your visual cortex or visual part of the brain would be computing the uh the side part of your brain called the parietal part of your brain would be doing virtually huge mathematical con computations to to allow you to catch that ball but the frontal lobe would be would be more to do with should i catch the ball can i catch the ball and to what effort would i put into making into into catching that ball so if you were playing um you know test matching cricket uh your executive part of your brain would probably um tell the rest of your brain right this is an all-out we 've got to do we 've got to catch that ball and throw everything into it to the extent that you might actually injure yourself whereas if it was a situation where it wasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide and i 'll just make an average effort so the executive part of your brain or the frontal lobe is very important in high level functioning the animal part of your brain is is uh to do with those basic drives and and really um actually powers up the rest of the brain animal brain is very similar to those of the animal kingdom conceptually we can think of the animal brain as like our inner caveman where drives for for food uh security sex you know control power uh reside and it is modulated down by the by the smart brain where high levels of social considerations come in but the animal brain actually does give emotional content to what goes on in the smart brain so it gives it gives emotional content to our thoughts to images sounds memories and to even higher concepts like um like justice altruism or social concerns the frontal lobe is uh not entirely unique we apes have have a degree of frontal lobe lower animals have a very rudimentary frontal lobe but the frontal lobe of humans is evidently able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other animals which whose brain is more adapted to their instinctive behaviors so a dog a dog 's thought life would revolve around smells dog hierarchy getting food and that kind of thing but we we have seen that monkeys are quite capable of things that we 're not capable of for example they can keep track of a large series of numbers for a reward and this may be a specialised feature for keeping track of where where the whole monkey tribe is in a in a fast-moving situation where they 're escaping a predator they can uh show quite complex social behavior and play but they 'll never really be able to understand poetry or or philosophy or moral dilemmas so the human brain has that additional ability which makes us unique in the animal kingdom it allows us to make complex judgments and adapting to change so in summary the frontal lobe is is the smart brain it 's like the executive part of the brain it controls the rest of the brain and just like uh in a company that 's where the corporate identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different judgments managing competing concerns and really uh adapting to change so for example if a company didn 't adapt to change they would cease to exist they would be overtaken by another company so adaption is is a key feature of the frontal lobe now just to put it into a picture which i think is always handy the animal brain is very much like uh the relationship between the smart brain animal brain is like a man riding a horse or a person riding a horse together they 're a unit but the animal the horse is providing that power agility and energy whereas the rider is is in control and providing direction so the smart brain in the ideal world is in control of the animal brain just a word on the smart on the frontal lobe which the frontal lobe is really the most complex thing in the universe and it takes quite a long time to develop to really you know to raise a human takes uh takes into the 20s and you could say their maturity continues to develop over time it plays a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex society now problems can arise through heredity or developmental adversity so for example an infection early in life or in in the uterus mental health problems and injuries or even diseases and so if the frontal lobe is is damaged in some way you can imagine that this um the way the organism functions as a whole the way the brain functions at a whole is not in balance the frontal lobe is if losing control means that the animal brain will tend to be more in control so how do substances produce addiction this picture is actually a picture of nerve cells in a petri dish they naturally branch out and connect to each other there are there are tens of thousands of connections within each nerve cell in the brain and then there 's so many billion nerve cells so you can imagine how many uh if you multiply those together how many how many billion connections there are in the brain those connections really are what give us that ability to associate things remember things and those connections are either strengthened or weakened depending on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at the chemical basis of learning learning of associations and behaviours dopamine levels and what happens to these learned associations in addiction i 'm going to play another little video which may some of the terminology may be a bit um unfamiliar beyond beyond us but uh i think you 'll get the idea of the role of the animal brain and dopamine in in the acquisition of learning the limbic system contains the brain 's reward circuit or pathway the reward circuit links together a number of brain structures that control and regulate our ability to feel pleasure feeling pleasure motivates us to repeat behaviors such as eating and other actions that are critical to our existence a reward or something linked with the reward activates cells in the ventral tegmental area or vta in the midbrain this sets off a chain reaction of activation in the reward circuit the activation of cells quickly reaches a key part of the vs called the nucleus accumbens the nucleus accumbens is often called the brain 's pleasure center when activated each cell generates an electrical signal that electrical signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as chemical messengers those chemical messages are received by another cell this is how cells communicate with each other in an activated neural circuit in the reward pathway dopamine neurons release the neurotransmitter dopamine the released dopamine molecules drift across the synapse they link up with proteins called dopamine receptors on the surface of the receiving cell these receptors span the receiving cells membrane with part on the outside and part on the inside of the cell in a healthy brain there is always a moderate level of dopamine in the synaptic space even in the absence of rewarding stimuli when a reward is encountered such as food the presynaptic cell releases a larger amount of dopamine in a sudden burst dopamine transporters will then quickly remove the excess returning the amount of dopamine to the original level dopamine surges in response to natural rewards help the brain learn adapt and navigate a complex world activation of the reward pathway has a far reaching impact throughout the brain from the vs the reward pathway extends to the prefrontal cortex or pfc the pfc powers our ability to think plan solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and the areas of the cortex that process sensory and motor information reward system activation also influences the cerebellum in the back of the brain which affects coordination of movement as well as attention normal activation of the reward system creates a physical imprint on the brain that links certain stimuli with rewards that satisfy biological needs such as food and make us want to fulfill those needs by seeking out those rewards once the brain associates a stimulus with a reward just seeing the stimulus can trigger a surge of dopamine in the reward system so that 's a little bit complicated but it demonstrates well that dopamine which is associated with pleasure pleasurable responses activates the whole brain and if you like uh causes like a snapshot of that situation which allows learning so those the visual images that the brain 's seeing position the place you know the location and the obviously the cause of the the pleasurable stimulus and everything associated with it is snap is snapshot and and those associations strengthen those associations strengthen um uh as as increased strength of nerve connections we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other and certain connections uh which are repeatedly activated uh actually make a physical connection stronger the actual little nerve terminal nerve connection becomes stronger the strength of dopamine release if you 've seen how the amount of dopamine dopamine actually causes that imprint and there are some different this is a this is a slide of some different things that can release dopamine such as food nicotine is a bit higher morphine 's up there somewhere sex is somewhere in there probably around the same level as food but this dark blue line is actually cocaine so it shows how it 's much higher than other naturally occurring or other other drugs and the purple line is actually from methamphetamine so we 're seeing a release of dopamine which is you know 10 times the amount which you receive in a naturally occurring reward because there 's such a large amount of dopamine the amount of reinforcement the amount of the snapshot if you like is not just a snapshot but it 's all it 's almost imprinted in the brain and we can see from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's look at a situation from our everyday experience fast food chains like us to spend their money there and so they realize that by making the food very tasty a bit salty a bit extra sugar they can make it very pleasurable so people enjoy a big mac as opposed to just a salad that extra taste and and the stimulation it causes heightens the amount of dopamine it 's released and that reward is quite high so what uh what the company does is associate that with these markers such as the big yellow m which is displayed so you can see it from hundreds of metres away certain color coordinated themes and so when you drive past a mcdonald 's you tend to get that associated learning your mouth starts watering and you think about having a you know a burger or a a coffee so that 's how that 's probably what we are familiar with in the drug using world different sort of associated stimuli are present so the site of the paraphernalia used to use drugs the site of money in one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner feelings uh such as the withdrawal symptoms running into people the day of the week so payday is uh a typical or a friday night is a typical trigger and these associated stimuli become very powerful we saw how in pavlov 's experiment that those associations can diminish over time and we call that extinction but these things take quite a long time to to to go away and this is part of the recovery process is waiting long enough for those associations to fade now with a well-functioning with a well-functioning frontal lobe we can we can resist we know we know that we need to lose weight we do we drive past mcdonald 's and don 't have the hamburger we don 't need but if you imagine that that the stimulation the stimulus to uh to get that reward is much much higher it will be that that more difficult to drive past and uh the other effect of substances is is on the frontal lobe uh this next video it 's a it 's a curious little video but it does illustrate well that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it to light up and to function so i 'll just play this this is your brain here are the neurons that produce dopamine when these neurons are activated they release dopamine here in the frontal lobes dopamine is motivation when dopamine is released you feel motivated to keep on doing whatever it is you 're doing dopamine is what makes things seem important and meaningful your frontal lobes are where thoughts are formed if your frontal lobes are low and dopamine you get bored and start looking for something that can stimulate your dopamine neurons to release more dopamine into your frontal food drink sex social pleasure and addictive drugs activate dopamine neurons directly that 's where they can be so addictive interesting sights and sounds can also activate dopamine neurons that 's why you 're still watching this video the frontal lobes themselves can form a positive feedback loop with the dopamine neurons this is called thinking very few people can form feedback loops like that without thinking that 's called meditation and it 's really difficult most people need to think about something interesting something they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them in their lives and plans and hopes they have for the future that 's why we never stop thinking our frontal lobes are drawn to whatever thought releases most dopamine that 's also how long-term thinking and self-discipline works we use our frontal lobes to activate our dopamine neurons even when what we 're doing is boring or difficult people vary in how well their frontal lobes can activate their dopamine neurons people with attention deficit disorder or addiction have great problems with it and most of us find it difficult to go for a salad and supply our own dopamine rather than having a burger or a cake which activate dopamine neurons directly just going to stop it there so this just indicates that the not only is dopamine part of the reinforcing part of our our animal brain but it also actually lights up the rest of our brain particularly the frontal lobe and where dopamine is deficient and a key example of that the attention deficit disorder in children uh then the rest of the brain tends to just run amok and the um the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyperactivity but we 'll see in the next slide that um that can occur in substance use as well so when when dopamine is released excessively for long periods of time there 's actually a a down a diminution in the dopamine activity the actual nerves can be damaged by too much dopamine uh particularly with methamphetamine because it releases dopamine into the nerve from from little envelopes where it 's protecting protected from the cell into the cell and that causes uh damage to the cell so this shows uh a scan which where a tracer has which attaches itself to dopamine neurons lights up and this is the person who 's never used methamphetamine this is a person who 's chronically used methamphetamine so you can see that it 's become less now in relation to the frontal lobe function scans have been correlated with the amount of dopamine receptors that light up and and certain tasks one is a motor task this could be responding to stimuli using using your hands this one is a memory task and this simply shows that the the less you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do either a motor task that is a manual task or a memory task so what that means is that people who 've used methamphetamine chronically their frontal lobes aren 't functioning as well and it 's not just about memory or doing a motor task it 's about judgment attention and a sense of who the person is these are all a bit um flaky and it means it has implications for recovery so in addiction we have excessive dopamine release which causes desensitization or exhaustion of the reserves and free dopamine damages nerve terminals such as which happens in ice addiction there are other effects of addiction that is the drug itself can actually be toxic to the frontal lobe and this particularly occurs the alcohol solvent sniffing and then there 's the whole series of things that occurs with addiction along with addiction such as head injuries car accidents assaults strokes from high blood pressure infections which can damage the brain functionally psychosis which is really like a computer being over driven or the voltage turned up too much by over stimulation causing circuits to sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprivation from overdose attempts or overdoses and or suicide attempts and in the case of cannabis and alcohol the the development of the frontal lobe can be impaired through through cannabis and alcohol and then there 's pre-existing conditions which are often associated with substance use such as adhd in which in which case there 's about a 50 risk of developing a substance use problem later in life if not treated and mental health issues where people can often are often tempted to self-medicate to feel better so the smart brain and the animal brain this picture just summarizes if you like what happens the smart brain in control the animal brain in control who is at risk of addiction uh this is barack obama as a teenager and obviously he didn 't get addicted to cannabis even though he 's showing pretty signs of being a bit stoned here so there are many reasons why people try substances it can just be experimental risk-taking teens tend to be a bit rebellious uh it 's it 's maybe very available for it because it 's never alcohol uh peer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up in a culture where substance use is just the norm so uh i 've got a patient who 's had his first cone when he was at cannabis came when he was when he was five which is something that you know it 's quite abnormal but in our in our sense but in the he in his culture that was normal uh there 's a it 's a gateway effect that one substance tends to lead to another substance it can be inadvertent exposure such as having a broken leg and being given a pain painkiller that can then lead to addiction and then there 's vulnerable times when people say what the hell just i want to feel better people that can be driven to feel better if there 's a lot of depression mental mental mental illness so uh it 's not a case of one thing will cause it it 's a it 's very much a balance and if you had identical twins there is a there is an element of um of a genetics involved and there 's an element of nurture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to the drug so uh one of some of these are these are features these are research if you like evidence-based data that are been proven to be associated with with addiction and childhood trauma and mental health issues are very important as again they don 't necessarily directly lead to addiction but they predispose by childhood mental health i 'm talking about say anxiety disorders asperger 's and adhd childhood trauma particularly sexual abuse children but domestic violence and that sort of thing disturbed parenting where the parenting has been inadequate or not not optimal may be caused by mental health issues of the parents substance using the parents under domestic violence neglect again i don 't want anyone to feel though if they know somebody or the parent of anybody who is addiction that they 're directly responsible these are these are statistical factors and many factors lead to addiction mental health in adult is another is another factor but the availability and type of addictive substances is a huge one i mean alcohol isn 't a particularly addictive substance but it is available widely and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our society uh social integration and peer influence if people are socially isolated or loners if you like there tend to be greater risk of addiction peer influence is actually a protective factor and it 's not as it 's not as big a concern as all the parents like to think they think well um i need to take my child out of that school and put them in a different school in fact if the child is a member of a peer group that 's likely to be protective even though that peer group may say use cannabis they 're likely to use cannabis within a certain range of use people that tend to go on to get addictive use of cannabis tend to be on the outer outer aspect of that peer group anyway genetics and epigenetics i 'll explain what that is later genetics is a big factor so if if there 's a person with a substance use history that has to be considered as a risk factor for that subsequent generation epigenetics is uh is what happens to our genes as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off so even though a person may have their media particular genes for addiction the the way genes are switched on and switched off by the uh by the parents behavior during their life may affect the risk of uh addiction in the subsequent generation so it 's really like a tug of war and it 's really a balance of factors i guess i 'm just coming to a point where uh to understand addiction we when we 're dealing with a person who is suffering addiction we often tend to uh come to some conclusion it 's a disease or it 's this person 's fault or they 're they 're a failure they 're morally their moral strength is poor there are there are incomplete models that have we 've used in the past and i think that moral failure has been a big one it tends to be the prevailing attitude in society that a person with addiction has got a character flaw and that 's simply simply an inadequate model to explain addiction given the circumstances relative to the person that person 's decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances may be no more drastic in the circumstances than than some of the decisions we 've made which we 're not happy with so moral failure is can 't be sustained really disease is certainly from what you 've seen the brain develops uh from its from its tendency to form habits and and form behaviors substances uh hijack that system so it it can be considered as a disease or at least a disorder of of habit formation and then the environmental exposure so this is why we have laws control alcohol availability and cigarettes etc because simply put if if you or i were exposed to enough of a drug we could become addicted social disadvantage is a factor but it 's definitely not the only factor people from all walks of life can become addicted self-medication is is a contributing factor some people use particularly say opiates to relieve emotional pain of trauma and it can be an accidental learning process where a person stumbles across a substance and it simply triggers a massive release of dopamine and they have trouble unlearning so we call this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess model of understanding addiction and to modify uh to treat somebody we have to come across we have to approach it from those different angles there 's also just uh mentioning also that models of human need this is a one from 1945 maslow it 's well known um amongst people who 've studied psychology or teaching and it does have this factor in the top called self-actualization and i guess that is to do with what 's um what becomes the most important thing in people 's lives what provides meaning or purpose and so i would add to that spiritual spiritual aspect and many programs have have that that aspect such as a or n a the 12 step programs so that 's the end of this talk and the next talk will be about specific substances the next talk will be amphetamines and ice which is ice and uh thank you for your attention and i hope it 's been beneficial"

got a few staff with us uh we 've got steve bernesconi who you would know who 's the head of communications we 've also got katie down here he 'll be filming this morning so if you don 't want any comments on the video you can save them to the end when we have questions we 've also got adam stewart up the back there uh and john maritich as well he 'll be here to answer any questions at the end uh if you 've got any burning questions that you would like to ask throughout the presentation feel free to ask them if you want to keep them to the end there 's certainly enough time to go through all that but today i just wanted to run through to start off with in the first part where we 've been some of the things that have happened and then in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future in that vision that has been built through the community through our strategies over a number of years uh to to get to the point where we are today so the story so far and i 'm looking around this room today and i know many people who have registered to get the video uh have been part of the planning process and the strategy process for nelson bay for a number of years and that started in recent times in 2012 with the nelson bay strategy which looks at the town centre and foreshore we 've also had the progressing of the nelson bay strategy which was finalized i believe in 2018 we 've also had a number of reports that were linked we 're linked to those strategies we 've also had these citizens parking panel which i know a number of you in this room were part of we 've also had a number of engagements with you through various groups and i know there 's groups represented here in nelson bay now the tomorrow business chamber we 've had the twra we 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole heap of community engagement and community involvement to uh fulfill it and uh drive our vision for uh nelson bay it 's a very special spot as we all know and uh it 's been loved to death over the last couple of months and we 've seen so many people here at this time of year which has been great we 've all got to remember to stay safe and do the right things there but we 've seen people really enjoying and embracing this part of the world maybe for the first time and maybe for the tenth time but we know how special this spot is so as part of that uh planning over over time and as part of the nelson bay strategy there was the apex park master plan that was in there that has been largely fulfilled 90 of the way there there 's still some works to be completed in that park there we had the opening late last year with some visitors from our sister city in japan we 've also had a our inaugural tomorrowy arts festival which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling that out again next year but using that park there uh fulfilling the strategy and the master plan for that park was i think a great result for that uh that park in the center of town there but uh we 've got a little bit of work to go so you would see that there 's some pavement that hasn 't been replaced in the park there that 's in this capital uh capital this year 's capital works program uh there is some landscaping and some uh some issues i 'm going to say or opportunities around getting some more shade into that park to make it a bit more usable uh during the summer but i think uh that 's a great uh opportunity for us to look at where you 've got a plan and working with the community to be able to uh really get that uh plan into fruition and have a great outcome like we do there that is the connection between waterfront and the cbd and as you can see there in that picture there that paving is the paving that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public domain plan process that 's how it was selected the yakima street extension something that i think has been a roaring success over the last uh 24 months or so that it 's been in there and help with traffic circulation in the town that there for anyone who doesn 't know is a long-term vision of some long-term locals in here to get that connection from the town centre uh through to the waterfront uh if you look at older pictures of that area there you know only a short time ago there was a bunch a bunch of shops there was a house that was there but now it is the connection from the eastern side of the cbd down to the foreshore uh we 're hoping to see that space activated as well with the possibility of farmers markets or any sort of markets in there but i think that 's been a great project as well that was pushed for by the community over a long period of time and was delivered by the council and i think it 's been a great success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's at the top of yakuba street there that 's again a project that council worked on with uh community group in nelson bay rotary bart richardson uh he was a long-term uh resident of port stevens and a member of nelson bay rotary passed away a few years ago and uh as part of his efforts and the club 's efforts over a number of years and uh there was some donations given after his funeral to complete this project uh we were able to to get that in there it tells his story and it is an amazing story there it 's a another piece of character for our area and it 's great to see that uh project completed now they were very passionate at the club about getting that in there very uh motivated to see it and finish and now it 's in there we 've got the digital signage in there as part of our wayfinding strategy as well that uh signage will be rolled out and has been rolled out across uh the lga the next the newest sign is out of peruvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one 's got the sound going as well and has some of these stories from the destination port stevens marketing campaign that is out there incredible by nature the public domain plan is certainly a very exciting plan and set the bold vision for the future of nelson bay i know a lot of you in this room were part of the planning process to get the public domain plan uh off the ground the nelson bay next brand that we see in this room was born two and a half years ago with a vision of taking forward the projects the events and all things nelson bay into the future so when we do a project when we uh when we are rolling out ideas when we are putting a strategy together nelson bay next is the vehicle that helps us tie everything together to make sure that uh those out in the community know things are happening because there are a lot of exciting things that do happen but when we launch the brand nelson bay next a couple of years ago we also got the funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public domain plan this is one of the renders from the public domain plan it doesn 't mean that 's exactly what it will look like when it rolls out but it sets the vision for the future and what we 're going to be looking at uh hopefully uh sooner rather than later and as i spoke about before this public domain plan is informing the works that are happening in nelson bay like apex park and the pavement that goes in there any new tree plantings trees do have to come out from time to time would be in line with this it 's a very exciting document around what we hope to see the town like and i think when you look at that picture uh the feedback that we got from people is that it has to be a place for people and that 's what this plan does it makes it a place where people want to spend a lot of time makes it pedestrian friendly bike friendly green corridors blue corridors down to the ocean and that 's what it all picks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those minor elements have been picked up in some of the temporary lighting that 's gone in there i know that we 've currently applied for a grant through the new south wales government for a better spaces grant and we 've worked on that with the chamber and the nelson bay precinct group around what we would like to see there and some temporary infrastructure to uh to push us off the back of of covert the parking panel i think this is a picture of the public domain plan group that was coming together i think but the parking panel was a group of people similar to this they all had their ideas around what parking should be like in nelson bay and i think we 've got a couple of that presented to council around the findings of the parking panel in nelson bay which was great to hear from not just our business people but our residents who live here in port stevens i believe there might have been a couple who were from outside the area there was a comprehensive report that was put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nelson bay a lot around better utilization the car parking that we have where we could have new car parking traffic flows and all those ideas flowed into the parking panels report and a lot of those are being implemented as well some were new ideas some are existing ideas but they were certainly all ideas that will enhance car parking in nelson bay so that 's a little bit about where we 've been and you probably know all that or you might have known some of that but that 's a little bit of of where we 've been where we 've got to so far with the vision for nelson bay we 're taking those strategies but what is what is next and what is the the next things that are on the horizon i think we 've uh we 've always got to be having things that we 're striving for i know that a lot of people speak to me around what they 'd like to see in the town where they 'd like the town to go what events attractions all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all i can say is it 's only money to get us there because when we looked at the original public domain plan and everything to be implemented in there and it was a year or so ago we 're looking at a figure of uh 100 million dollars plus so we 're never going to be able to do everything or we 'd like to but we will work to do as much as we possibly can at the council the first thing uh we 're going to talk about today is is smart parking and that 's something that has certainly been a topic of conversation lately and something that is an exciting program for the cbd of nelson bay one of the recommendations of the parking panel report is that we look at the introduction of technology we 've also got our smart smart cities blueprint which is currently on public exhibition or has just finished its public exhibition period looks looks at the introduction of new technologies into the fort stevens lga smart parking is one of those initiatives which is a really exciting program of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what is smart parking is basically a technology-based program of uh infrastructure to manage car parking in the cbd so if you 're looking at nelson bay cbd what we are looking at as a council and what we 've uh resolved and currently are investing in is the installation of smart parking through the cbd what which would include sensors uh in all the on-street car parks and sensors in the off-street car parks that are publicly owned we 'll also include updating the foreshore meters down there as well we are keeping the smart parking across the cbd and the foreshore which will be an upgrade for the for sure free for all residents so residents will be able to register uh to have free car parking at all times which is a change uh for now so if you have a business down the foreshore uh you 've got now access to uh all the residents we 're also rolling that out for workers as well we are uh keeping those funds in the cbd of nelson bay that is the resolution so any money that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town to fund the works that we have spoken about a little bit from the public domain plan can we ask questions if you want me just to finish on the smart parking then you can ask some questions around there the program of works that is in there has been put through the council and comes out of the public domain a public domain plan comes out of the works that would be required in the cbd of nelson bay to provide extra car parking we 're looking at an extra 220 car spots in the cbd of nelson bay on top of what we have at the moment we 're looking at the introduction of a new app for the cbd of nelson bay to find your car spots easier so that includes the foreshore we also have signage at the entrance to nelson bay from the east end and the west end to tell you where the available car spots are in nelson bay so if you 're driving in there that would say that there is 20 available car spots in the donald street east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and victoria parade to better direct cars to their spots the science behind it and the reports that we have got there is that if we increase car parking by 15 we would get much better traffic flow much better uh ability for people to find a park a lot quicker and we 're aiming for over 20 increase in car parking across the uh area there the area that we 're looking at for par smart parking in nelson bay is the current boundary on the on victoria parade uh up to church street but not including church street uh tomaree street to the uh to the north but not including tomorry street and then down yakaba and just moving a little bit into magnus to the east and donald street to the east so the core of the cbd there we 'll also be introducing a 15-minute free parking for the cbd so you don 't have to pay for the first 15 minutes so if you 're just dropping in you can use meters you can use the app you can register your car if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking in nelson bay if you live outside the lga so if you 're living inside the lga working in the cbd of nelson bay then this uh would be free for you there 's a registration program if you get a new car you register your new car and you never need to do anything so if you pull into the cbd of nelson bay you 've registered your car once a year ago you don 't have to do anything you just park and you obey the signs that are there whether they 're one hour two hour four hour or all-day parking this is also being introduced in shoal bay and berubi but starting in nelson bay and the same as nelson bay these the funds that are collected through this are staying in those towns so the upgrade of shoal bay will be paid for from the parking in shoal bay the upgrades to berubi will be paid and nana bay will be paid for from the parking in those towns currently council has fees and charges that they charge for parking off-peak is 3.20 peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat and the science and the great work that adam has done up the back there is that in a 24-hour period in the cbd of nelson bay that that car spot would be utilized by somebody from outside the town for less than an hour that is very conservative from what we 've we 've worked out but that 's three dollars and nine cents a day per car parking spot to deliver uh the works program that we 're looking at and i 'll touch on what we 're doing as far as the works program going forward with these but all those calculations have been worked in and they are only calculations that have been done at this stage and forecast because this program that is being rolled out here is unlike others in other cbds so when you look at newcastle or other areas in the state and we 've certainly looked at those they charge everyone we don 't want to do that we want to make sure that we 're providing for a great uh platform for locals and a great experience for visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it 's not just about charging them it 's about giving them a great experience when we go into what the programmable funds that includes infrastructure extra car parking uh navigation but also events attraction and marketing to the cbd and of nelson bay which will be localized here which has never happened before uh sorry probably hasn 't happened since nelson bay town management was around did you have yeah just a couple of questions for that and first of all thank you for joining us for bringing the community together i think that 's that 's important and just a couple of questions with that so if you don 't have a smartphone and you come to the area how do you do it so as i said before there 'll be meters in the street there you can use the meters that are there just like any other place it 's actually in law that you must be able to have a certain amount of meters that you feed money into it 'll also be tap and go on those meters uh that are there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so how many car spaces are nelson amazing uh in the cbd of nelson bay that aren 't currently captured by the foreshore uh there 's around 550 odd so if you 've got labels coming in you imagine that they would take up maybe 300 400 spots well the utilization 's in all the reports that have been done over the years sometimes it 's 100 i we we 've modeled it on uh in a 24-hour period uh you would have under one hour in that 24-hour period uh used by a visitor to the area i said so the next question would be what 's the projected revenue for that because you 've got to make sure obviously that your revenue justifies what you 're doing so the foreshore meters at the moment collect around 600 000 a year the which is split between the crown which must be spent on crown land and what we have on our own lands so the split of that is 62 crown 38 council loan so the ford works program takes into account the split and where that money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and second year is 550 000 that would be collected so a total works program of 1.15 would be rolled out each year there are some costs that come into that as far as a recurring cost each year such as the marketing uh which would go back into the cbd the works program we 're looking at and including uh seven section 94 which is now 7-eleven funds which will be rolling out this program we 're looking at around about a 15 million program over the next 10 years the the cold hard fact around this is going forward there is very limited if any money available for the upgrade of nelson bay salamander raymond terrace madowi any of those town centres without doing something different shoulder ruby without doing is something a little bit different we 've got a very special place here where we want to bring more people in and this hopefully with the spending that comes off the back of this you 've got to have money to make money we are very hopeful that when we 're putting up dollars community dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract those grants to build on what we 've got at the moment we don 't get handouts for large projects very often and cbd 's and we hear from the state government quite regularly what 's different to your cbd to the next cbd to the next dvd to the next cbd to the next one and as i said before if we don 't take a risk there 'll be no reward so the reward for nelson bay is the upgrade the activation for uh this this town to move it forward so this is a vehicle to get us from where we are today and i would say that no town and if you 're watching the video there and you 're jealous around towns and what 's happened no town besides nelson bay has had the money spent on it like here so we 've had apex park we 've had the yakuba street extension which is uh if you 're taking a account the property purchases millions and millions of dollars you 've got the demolition of the car park there and the installation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park we 've also got new public amenities going in there raymond terrace would die for that at the moment they 've got money allocated and they 've got a public domain plan that 's happening at the moment and some funds allocated towards that just like nelson bay did but i can say that nelson bay is getting its fair share of the small pie at the moment if not more i might have got this wrong but you say did it create 220 parking spaces or did i so that 's uh in the in the program of works that will come off the back of this installation smart parking there 's 220 extra spots in the cbd uh there 's 30 on-street ones on stockton street so we 're looking at the circulation of the town which will be increased by 30. we 're also looking at the uh better utilization of foreshore along victoria parade there 's also the park that is at the top here which is road reserve which is uh i think it 's called waramai park at the moment uh adam where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more there 's about an extra 30 there as well uh there is the breakdown i can certainly give that um to everyone here and we can put that in the faq for this as well where they where they are but there 's 220 extra spots that would be going on top of where we are at the moment just a commented question i want to say the the 15 minutes and the frida residence i think are a fabulous concept as far as getting the locals back into town so i really like that idea the second the question is um there 's obviously a significant capital outline to implement this um is the money collected going to be used to recoup that outline yep very good question i believe it 's not having the works program in front of me but i believe it 's around 300 000 that we are contributing to uh the installation of sensors of meters of the technology that goes in near the app we 're using the new south wales government 's uh parking app as well uh the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per meter uh throughout the town which is i think less than a hundred dollars i think it is it 's it 's very minimal there but they have been factored into the program there as well um so they 're all there uh in black and white to see and we can certainly distribute that list you 're indicating what i was talking about is the when we 're talking about the program of works that 's the money that we 're projecting i i think it might be a little bit low um but we might be overestimating as well so any money that 's left over certainly goes back into the cbd as well and that 's definitely what we wanted to do and anything we 've wanted to do here is just enhance the town we 're not always going to get it right and i 'll 100 acknowledge that there will be errors there will be uh problems with the with the system and rolling it out but we will move as quickly as we can to fix them and make sure it 's as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cbd and we want these works to happen quicker rather than sitting on a shelf which sometimes happens with strategies and plans for the cbd planning controls we 've currently got our document which i think a lot of you would have picked up in coming into the room which is revitalizing nelson bay we have got gateway approval from the department of planning for the changes to a number of uh planning controls in the cbd of nelson bay we all would have seen these over the last 18 months and it is uh largely around the changing of some building heights through the town the vast majority of the town won 't have uh substantial increases to their heights through the core of the cbd and to the east is about reflecting what is a core uh height for a building uh one level of the building so going from three meters to three point five meters uh so we 're still staying at the five uh level height limit down before sure is three stories uh in the bulk of the marina site and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open down to the ocean and we 've also got at the back here uh an increase in height which reflects uh the buildings that are at the back here including the landmark and then to the west of stockton street the height which will be increasing to 28 meters from its current height limit of 15 meters the introdu introduction of a floor to space ratio allows us to better utilize the blocks that we have for vue corridors so you cannot build boundary to boundary and go to 28 meters if you wanted to go to 28 meters you to explain a floor to space ratio if you have a one to one ratio means you could build from boundary to boundary at one story if you had two to one you could go two stories covering half the block if it 's three to one you could go three stories covering a third of the block so that promotes view corridors through the town so you 've got to be creative with your buildings if you want to get up to that height limit we 're also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are building in the core of the town that when you are where it is a town centre it 's a cbd when you have that space down the bottom that is a commercial element you are using that as a commercial space we 've seen it flouted maybe over the years that you put in a small unusable space that 's not what this is about is making sure that we 're using our town center as a town centre so that when we have more people living in the cbd and enjoying the cbd that the amenities are there not just about residential we 've also got minimum street furniture so if you 've got a skinny small block you 've got to be working with your neighbor to to make something happen we don 't just want development happening and going up here there and everywhere that 's a small skinny building you 've got to be able to work with there so you can get that design excellence which is also part of the planning proposal as well we 've introduced a urban design review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newcastle 's panel before but we have our own urban design review panel which is made up of architects and planners who specialise in this to work with the proponents to get the building to a point where it is uh at its best we hope um we always and the ones that i 've seen from chalk and cheese from where they start to where they get to because of the recommendation of these panels that is on the exhibition currently enough all the details are on the back there or on our have your say website just a brief question i get the impression that essentially reflects the 2018 strategy that was passed by council is that correct yes that is correct so what happens is we work on the strategy at a local level it then comes to council for our tick of approval to go to the state government they give us a gateway approval where they cut the documents then come back to us to do more work with the community and then it would go for endorsement after that and there may be changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and activation so as part of the smart parking plan uh we are making sure that when we are taking something away or a risk as it 's perceived by many and i certainly spoke about taking a risk in the cbd that we 're bringing back people on a regular basis we know what a great job and a lot of the volunteers in this room have done with events in the cbd like the country music festival the taste festival loves seafood these events bring people into the cbd the tomri arts festival but they do cost money they do take a lot of time a lot of volunteer work goes into the back of these so to get these happening we need to obviously fund these and this is part of the public domain works sorry the public domain and traffic flow and uh events and activation money that will be coming from the smart parking and this is in there at the moment uh we 've currently got a level in there i 've been talking with adam about getting it up we 've got 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should aim for a little bit higher out of that public domain plan we spoke about this before currently in that plan we 've got stockton street and magnus street um but there 's a lot of discussion we had around that and where those uh public domain works occur we 've also got uh works happening along victoria parade we 've got street signage around the cbd that 's all up for discussion around where the funds are spent but there is a preliminary schedule of works across the town and at the moment i think as we all know the world economy is uh a little bit is struggling a little bit uh there 's also never been a better time to borrow funds either so there 's ability and ability for us to possibly borrow some funds against projections or once we 've got some figures together around what the parking uh brings to expedite some of these works because when you 're borrowing at an interest rate with a one in front of it sometimes it 's much better to do the work because the costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a higher rate than that so to get all the work done at once may be a better way to do it this is something that 's happening uh quite soon and in the cbd of nelson bay along magnus street we 're looking at and resurfacing of the road very shortly and at that time so if you look to the east of the one-way section of magnus street we 've done that road work there and the road smooth nice beautiful that 's coming to magnus street so at the same time we 've got the ability to do some stamping into the pavement there uh and also some painting to do something a little bit different and uh differentiate that shared zone from the non-shared zone as well and that will be going in at the same time as the sensors into magnus street ahead of the census may ask the question yes i 'm sorry this is covered in documentation but going back to that public domain plan has there been any discussion about turning magnus street and stockton rock street that t-bar and dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh there has been there 's been lots of discussion around that i think the ability to turn it into a pedestrian more when we want it is the is the way that we 've sort of gone so far because i think we 've seen examples in other towns where they 've had to revert to letting traffic in again and we want to allow parking in those areas as well so we 're going to have the ability where you can close it off if you 're having a an event i know in the cbd of melbourne i think they have certain times where the bollards just pop up and you 've got pedestrian uh areas at certain times of the day so uh we we 've cavend for that for the future as well you 'll all obviously know that we went through a special rate variation program that had 15 million dollars from town that was coming out of uh businesses pockets uh that was spread around this is a vehicle that is specific for nelson bay to get it from here to there we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some stage and say i 'm not going to pay for parking uh but guess what if they want to park 200 metres down the road they can get free parking somewhere it 's their choice whether they do it or not if they turn around and go to somewhere else i would and i have no evidence to back this but i would think that for every person we turn right away with an upgraded cbd with marketing campaigns with events specific to nelson bay we would attract more than that one person we are here today to dispel some of those myths to provide some of the information when you pick up the paper and it says uh something that is one piece of the puzzle when you 've got a thousand piece puzzle uh sure that is going to scare people and that 's exactly why i 'm willing to turn up here every time that there is a questions and doing the video here to provide the information to all the people because you want all the picture if you if you take one thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever it shall be engagement on this has been going on for many many many years uh in a report that i believe yourself and another gentleman in this room presented to council one of the recommendations was to investigate smart parking we also had the on-street drop-in session we had 1400 people go to our uh have your say page we had 150 people fill in surveys we had a go through council a public document we had a reporter on the front page of the paper previously when the smart partner came in there 's lots of engagement and we can always do more and more and more and i 'm happy to go out there as many times as it possibly can be to to make sure we get the questions right and to implement the ideas as well because the ideas that are flowing into the car parking uh proposal aren 't just um aren 't just maybe um adam 's office they come from the community um the 15-minute free car parking i think came from the chamber or nelson bay now whoever shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so we 'll do it we want to make it as easy as possible for people to use this system we 've already already spoken about we will have the trestle tables on the street in nelson bay making sure that if you never touch the computer a smartphone or whatever it shall be in your life then you can register for it or you can ring the front office or council whatever it shall be we 're not going to start pinging people for doing the wrong thing straight away there 'll be those trial periods all those things have to be taken into account things change is scary it 's always scary for anyone but we want to make sure that as we go along we get as much information out there as possible we would have loved to have um rolled out the engagement program and and uh started uh uh a little bit later but we 're here we are today and we 're we 're starting on it now and feeding more ideas in so uh that 's that 's the way we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner or they can 't give a reason they come to go to the fantastic fish shopping for local brawns yeah um i think that 's the biggest concern for me is i 'm i 'm pleased that council 's considering the process part of it which is making it easier for people to come and to partner by but they 're commenting about we 've got empty shops that 's not because we don 't have parking there 's a fundamental shift in retail as we all see has hap is happening and has been expedited by kobe and that 's not going to go away so i think it 's about you know talking about the public domains the use of the area we want this to be a place that people come and have a good experience different to costs or moosa or wherever else they want to go it has to be a really special place to come and experience something and that to me is what the business community may even say and the community working together because we will provide that experience we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job the parking and the roads and all those good things and helping us with the public demand but we need to look more closely i think what makes us so special and happening thank you everyone for coming along this morning it 's gone a little bit longer than i expected but hopefully most of your questions are answered but if you don 't have your questions answered you can email phone uh not myself or staff or whoever you you would like to get the information from we won 't have all the answers for everything at one time because we want to make sure we get it right and we 're not setting something in stone but we 'll continue to work on this program and hopefully the next conversation we have is what 's the next project that we do so thank you all you"

make a racing game the player uses the mouse to navigate a boat to an island without bumping into obstacles well you will make you 've just seen the example so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a play around with it first you 're more than welcome to so what you will need like always we 've got a computer running scratch three we 're gonna be doing the online version but if you want to do it offline you can also download it here what you will learn use operators to compare numbers in scratch add code to detect when a sprite is touching a color in scratch and use a variable to record the time in scratch and like always additional information for educators in there so we 're gonna go on from our introduction to getting started open the starter project so like our previous ones we have our starter project so we 'll open that up so we 'll click on that now ok we 've opened now start project so we 'll go back into our lesson and we 'll give that a tick so I 'll have a look the project includes a boat sprite and a race course pack topless wood that the boat sprite has to avoid and a desert island that the boat has to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand over here so we have a look in the house we can see the same thing we 're good so I 'll go back to our boat race lesson and then we 'll keep that a tick and scroll down and now the first thing we 're going to learn is how to control the boat so with controlling the boat the player will control the boat strike with the mouse so we 're going to add code to the boat sprite so that it starts in the bottom left hand corner pointing up and then follows the mouse pointer so then dad when green flag clicked point interaction zero go to X minus 190 Y minus 150 and forever point towards the mouse pointer and move one step that 's a bit of code in there so let 's add that now so again you go up into our scratch project then we 're going to go in first into our events already selected our boat so we want when green flag clicked then we need motion we want point in direction of don 't have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to XY minus 119 minus 150 awesome it 's already a mess now we 'll go into our controls we want a forever loop me now forever loop we want to know that motion 1 and we want point towards mouse pointer and we want news but just one step so now if we mean flag and test our code Humbert will stop following us know just be going towards the mouse pointer stop that now ok I came to our listen so I 've done that so we 'll give that a dick and scroll down so test your code by clicking the green flag and moving the mouse does the boat sprite move towards a mouse pointer yes it does we 've done that so we 'll give that a get and it will scroll down what happens when the boat which is the mouse pointer try it out to see what the problem is well didn 't see one let 's see what it is we 'll go back into scratched well press the green flag and let 's see what happens when the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't want that to happen so we 'll go back into our lesson and the problem seems to be it 's bouncing back and forth really quick so give that a tick so to stop this from happening you need to add an S block to your code so that the boat sprite only moves if it 's more than five pixels away from the mouse pointer if you think you can do that you can try that now but we 'll have a look at what the hint says the boat should only point towards the mouse pointer and move if the distance to the mouse pointer is greater than 5 pixels if you think you can figure it out from that then try now we 'll go to the next year hint these are the code blocks you need to add to the code of the boat spray if greater than distance to mouse pointer so if you think you can add that now try now we 'll see what the last hint is so this is what our code will look like going to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than five that it 'll move so let 's add that now so we 'll go back to scratch and we 're going to go down to how controls if n put that round now point towards mouse pointer and move one step then we want you to go down to our operators and we want a greater than man we want it to be greater than five then we want to make it and sensing and want a good distance to Mouse points up and place that in there now so now if we go in and press the green flag and test that the boat won 't keep going back and forth when it gets all the way on the mouse pointer very good so now we 'll go back into our lesson and we 'll scroll up and give that a dick and scroll back in so test the code again to check whether the problem is now fixed as we saw it was so we 'll give that one a tick as well and now next step is crashing very good crashing at the moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to fix that now you need two costumes for your vote sprite one normal costume and one for when the boat crashes duplicate your but that boat sprite costume and name one costume normal and the other hit so we 'll do that now so I 'll go back into scratch and then we 're going to go into our costume we 're going to right click on our normal costume and duplicate it we 'll call our second one okay okay so we 'll go back into our lesson now that we 've done that and give that a tick now we 're going to scroll down now click on your hit costume and use the Select tool to grab pieces of the costume and move and rotate them to make the boat look like it is crash two pieces one looks pretty good so you can add little explosions to yours to scribble on it make it look as good as can but I 'm going to go ahead and do that now so I 'm just gonna make mine look at their destroyed so can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ship and do some rotating of them make it look nice and destroyed make a few chunks out of it that way then if you want you can go into your brush and you know give it some explosions very good okay so now we 've done that we 'll go back into our lesson we 'll give that a tick and scroll down now add code to your boat so that it crashes and breaks up when it touches any Brown wooden barrier if you think you can do that beforehand try now or we 'll go into the hints you need to add code blocks inside your forever loop so that the code your code keeps checking if the boat sprite has crashed and if it has crashed the code needs to reset the boat sprites position so if the boat is touching the brown color of the wood you need to switch to the hit costume say no for two seconds and then switch back to the normal costume finally you 'll need to point up and go to the start position if you think from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go to the next hint here are the code blocks you need if touching color white then sew inside of an if then block go to X minus 119 Y minus 150 switch costume to hit point in direction of zero so it 's costume to normal say no for two seconds so if from those you think you can do it try now or go to the final hint so here 's what your code should look like so we 're going to add our code in there so everything else in here is the same and then we put a whole nother one inside of our block so let 's add that now so go back to your scratch project and then we 're going to go back to our code and first we need a control block of if-then and then we want a sensing block of touching color will pop that in there and we 'll change it from the black color then to the brown of the wood now we 're going to go into our looks and we 're going to go switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall that 's gonna change the hit we 're also going to grab a say the two seconds and we want to say no and then we 're going to then switch our costume back to normal and then we 're going to go into our motion we 're going to point into direction of zero again and then we 're going to grab a go to X Y and put that down the bottom then we 're going to go minus 190 and Y will be minus 150 so now we press the green flag test airship help oops scratched go back to normal and it 's driving fine but it 'll crash and it 'll go back very good yes so now we 'll go back to our lesson and then we 'll just scroll up and give that a tick and then we 'll scroll down you should also add code to make sure that your boat sprite always starts out looking normal test your toe again if you 're trying to sell the boat through a wooden barrier now the boat should crash and then move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we also want to have our boat always start as normal so we 'll add that to it as well just in case we stopped the game Midway and try to start again so we 'll go back in and at the very top we want to have our switch costume so we 're going to our looks right up the top switch costume to normal and that 'll fix that up so if we press the green flag and we crash and then we stop the game before it does it and then we start again we 'll go back to normal very goodness so now we 're going to go back into our lesson give that a tick and then I going to go into our next step which is winning now under winning now add another if statement to your boat sprite code so that the player wins when they make the boat arrived at the yellow island when the boat gets to the island the game should say yeah and then it should end so if you think you can do that without the hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add more code blocks inside your forever loop so that your code keeps checking if the player has one if the boat is touching the color of the island you need to say yeah for two seconds and then stop all and the game if you think you can do it from those hints there try now we 'll go on to the next hint here are the code blocks you need say yeah for two seconds if touching color yellow stop all so if you think you can do it from there try now if not we 'll go to the last step here 's what your new code should look like if touching color yellow saying yeah for two seconds stop all inside an if then walk don 't forget that this new code needs to be inside the forever loop so we 'll add that now so we 'll go back to our lesson we 'll scroll down it 's getting a bit long the code so we need in our controls and if then more pop that then being that we 've already got our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pop it in there and then we 're gonna change the brown for the wood to a yellow for the desert island and we 've also already got a say for two seconds I 'm gonna pinch that as well don 't need all the other bits so I 'll get rid of those no just pop that in there you 're going to say yeah the two seconds and then we 're going to go in all the way to the bottom of our controls to our stop all and pop that in there so now that our code is getting a bit longer we can test that out so we 'll crash if we go all the way there yeah just gonna pick up the poke and put it all the way over here in test fit at winds yeah you can 't pick up the boat if you 're doing it in forestry no so that 's just for testing purposes okay so that works we 'll go back to our lesson and we 've done that so we 'll give that a tick and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects can you add sound effects that play when the boat crashes or reaches the island you could even add background music so if you remember from our previous ones adding sound if not we 've got our adding a sound from the library so you can scroll down and have a look through there how you want to do it which sounds are going to be good for yours and if you want to add some background music so I 'm going to add that now now magically when I go back into my scratch project it 'll already be there so we 'll go back into scratch I 'm just going to click the green flag what happens when I crash that 's no good and what happens when I get to the end good okay so I 'm going to go back into the lesson now and I 've added some sound and hopefully you 've added your own ones so now we 're going to start with adding a timer so adding a timer now you 'll add a timer to your game so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible so you need to add a new variable called time to your stage so we 've previously added variables so if you need a hint or reminder there in here on how to do it but we 'll go in and add the time now so go back into scratch we 're going to our variables and we want to make a variable called time and now we 'll go back into our lesson we 'll check that one then so what we can do is we can actually put the variable down on the island so it looks a bit you need them so I 'll go back into the Western and show you a house so we 're just going to drag our timer all the way over here because we don 't need it to save time if you 're right click on it we can just have a large readout it 'll just be the number there and then we 'll go back into our lesson now we need to add code blocks to your stage so that the timer counts up until the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that without a hint try now or we 'll go in and use the hint on the stage when the green flag is set the time to zero inside your forever loop you 'll need to wait 0.1 seconds then change the time by 0.1 if you think you can do that from that hint you can try now or we 'll go to the next hint here are the code blocks you 'll need change time by 0.1 when green flag clicked forever wait 0.1 second and set time to zero so if you think you can do that from that hint try now I will go to the final hint so here 's what your code should look like when green flag clicked set time to zero forever wait 0.1 seconds change time by 0.1 so let 's add that now so we 'll go back into scratch now we 're going to select our our background our stage then we 're going to grab an event block for when flag clicked and then we also want a control block with a forever loop and right at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to change time by 0.1 we also need our no and sorry controls and we want a weight 0.1 so now what 'll happen is every time we click the green flag the time will start counting and if we crash and the time on keep going until we get to the end then if it 'll stop there now if we put something flag again it will reset the time to zero like so all good sort of go back into our lesson now that we 've done that and did bad at it and scroll down test out your game and see how quickly you can get the boat to the island so have a few guys see how quickly you can get your boat to the island and see if you can beat your previous time and then when you 're done give that a chit and we 're going to go on to the next step obstacles and boosters so obstacles and boosters right now the game is far too easy so you 'll need to add some things to make it more interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat edit your stage backdrop by adding in some white booster arrows so we 'll go in and do that now so I 'll click on how scratch lesson and sneekly enough we 've already got if we go into our backdrops and go into our costumes we can click on that drop two and they 're already there but if you want you can go into backdrop one and you can draw your arrows yourself using the white so just change it from that to that and then you can draw your arrows in however you like but I 'm going to leave it and go to that drop two instead because they 're already there and they look pretty cool okay so now I 'm gonna go back into my lesson and give that a tick now add more code blocks to your boats forever loop so that the boat sprite moves three extra steps when it touches a wide error so we want her if then touching color white move 3 steps so let 's add that now so I 'll go back into boat race need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grab in control or if then more pop that in here will pop that in at the bottom and then we want to grab a setting we weren 't touching column and this time we want touching color white so I 'll click in there and then it 's touching color white we want motion we want to move three extra steps so now if we press the green flag and test set out its how but those over the arrow look at how much faster very good so now we 'll go back into our lesson you give they rotate test your game to see whether your new booster arrow speed up the book we just did and they did so we can give that a thick now next you 'll have spinning cake that has to avoid that 's tricky add a new sprite that looks like this in call it gate so we want a new sprite it 's just a big long brown stick and then make sure that the color of the gate sprite is the same as the color of the wooden barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'll add that now so we 're going to paint a sprite and the easiest way to get the correct brown color for the gate is if you click over on the backdrops then if we select the fill up the top and grab the eyedropper we can then choose around there men it 'll keep when we go back to our sprite one and then we 'll go up to select ow the wrinkle will just draw then we also want our outline to be the same color so choose that as well we 've got that name and then we want to select it and we just want to Center that Y so we 'll shrink it down a bit as well maybe 60 will be good over here nice and hard to dodge and we 're going to call it date so now we have it the same color as the Brownwood walls so if the boat crashes into it it 'll trigger the same thing it in crash and then go back to the beginning so now we 'll go back into our lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right color so we can give that a tick then we 'll scroll down make sure that the center of the gate sprite is positioned in the middle so to do that we can just click and drag it and line it up but I 'll just show you again how that works so we 'll go back into the scratch and when we select it it 'll line up and the little cross a line up nicely there and then we 'll go back to our lesson and you 've got a tick add code to your gate sprite to make it spin slowly forever so if you remember correctly back to our space animation we did a very similar thing with the monkey but if you need a hint we can go in here or you can try it now so we want to add code block to the gate sprite so that it turns one degree forever some will go across here our code blocks you need so when green flag pressed forever turn one degree so if you think you can figure it out from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should look like when green flag pressed forever turn one degree so I 'll add that to our gate now so go into our code we want our event when cream flag pressed warning our controls are forever and we want motion we want it to turn one degree so now we 'll go back into our lesson and give them a tip now test your game again you should now have a spinning gate that you need to steer Noster again your code around so we 'll go back into our project and we 'll test about now so we 'll have our boat moving along takes a little while to get all the way over there if I move it up here then we 'll just watch out because we 're gonna crash into the gate oh yeah it might be a bit big for the game so we might want to shrink that down a little bit more back down to the 15 that way got a better chance of avoiding it but it gets too easy make a pickup anyway we 'll go back to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving your game so challenge improving your game can you add more obstacles to your claim for example you could add green slime to your backdrop and make changes to the codes so that the slime slows the boat down when the player lets them touch you could add a moving obstacle for example a log or a shock can you turn your game into a race between two players the second player will need to control their boat using the up arrow to move forward and the left and right arrow keys to turn can you create more levels by adding different backdrops and can you then allow the players to choose between levels so if any of these challenges interest you you want to have a go at them let us know on the vo afterwards which ones you 've tried and how well you went with them some of them could be really cool to that shark and the log or whatever creatures you want different things to slow down the boat speed it up other levels but if you do add any let us know in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on completing the boat race project would you like to try something a little more challenging you could try out the memory project click on the green flag to start watch the sequence of colors shown by the dancers dress and listen to the accompanying drumbeats and repeat the colors back to her if you get the colors order wrong it 's game over so we 'll test that out so that 's part of module 2 through the scratch lessons on the code club Australia site but you have now completed lesson 6 and that 's the end of module 1 so congrats project completed you 've all done very well if you 've followed it to the end so give yourself a pat on the back a round of applause and if you 've enjoyed the videos let us know so if you 're interested in more coding projects there 's more here on the Raspberry Pi website along with spoke club related one and if you 've enjoyed these videos and you 'd like to see more of them from the Port Stephens library make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully we 'll be seeing you in future tutorials so from Matthew at Port Stephens library I hope you 've had a good time with me and I hopefully I 'll be seeing you in person soon and have a nice day"

    "text": "hello again everyone its Matthew from Port Stephens live beam we are going to continue on from our last lesson moving on to lesson 5 introduction to scratch if you followed last video you Levent finished around here on chat pot with the one next page so this lesson we 're going to do the paint box project so like last time there 's an example here if you want to click on the green flag I can see how it works some drawing and erasing will move on to that so now we 're going to click on our try the paint box project now we 're going to do the paint box project and this is a scratch 3 version so we 're going to do with no introduction make your own paint program what you 'll make click on the green flag to start use the mouse to move the pencil and hold down the left mouse button to draw click on a color to change pencils click on the eraser to change it and use it to erase your work to clear the page click on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of that we 're going to use that one there but what we will learn today is how to add the pen extension in scratch how to use broadcast to control the sprite in scratch and recall how to respond to Mouse events in scratch so what you 'll need like always we 've got our computer running scratch 3 we 're using the online version and then if you 're doing it offline there 's to start a project in there and as well additional informations there educators so now we 're going to get right into it with our introduction so first off we 're going to make a pencil so start by making a pencil that you can use to draw on the stage so we 're going to open the paint box scratch start a project so like the chap 1 we 've got a starter project open so we 'll just click on the link here and it 'll open up the starter project for us ok in the start project you 'll see that you 've already got a pencil and eraser down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the starter project in begin with so now we 'll go back up to our listen we 'll scroll down in the starter project you should see pencil and eraser sprites which we solved so we 'll but then and then we 'll scroll down so now we 're going to add the pen extension to your project so let 's find out how to do that now so click yum so to use the pen blocks in scratch you need to add the pen extension click on the add extension button in the bottom left hand corner click on the pen extension to add it we 're going to do that the pen section that appears at the bottom of the blocks menu okay so let 's go into our scratch project and do that now so we 'll go down to the bottom left and we 'll click Edit extension and we 'll click on the pen 1 and then we 'll see it 's now at the bottom there now we 'll go back into our lesson and give that a tick and scroll down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pencil sprite to make the sprite follow the mouse pointer forever so that you can draw so we want to add a wind flag clicked forever loop and go to mouse pointer so let 's go in and do that now so we 're going to go into our events grab when flag clicked we 're going to our control well grab a forever loop and we 'll go to our motion we 're going to go to a random position and we 're gonna change it to mouse pointer so now if we go to the green flag and test it now pencil should follow the mouse as we go very good stop that for now and we 'll go back into our lesson and give that a dick so now we 're going to scroll down click the flag and then move the mouse pointer around the stage to test whether your code works as we just saw it does so we give that a tick as well now we 'll go to the next step which is next make your pencil only draw if the mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this code to your pencil sprite so if Mouse Coun then pen down else pen up so we need an if-then-else block a mouse down but what the pen down and a pen up block so we 'll add that now so we 'll put back into scratch first off we 'll grab our hole with now if then else and we want to go into sensing and we want to mouse down that in there now we 're going to go to our pen and we want and down it 's mouse down and if Mouse isn 't down we want it to be pen off so now we 'll go back into our lesson and give that a tick now test your code again this time move the pencil around the stage and hold down the mouse button can you draw with your pencil let 's find out so go back into scratch click the flag and let 's say you can draw very horrible face that I 've drawn oh well very good so now we 'll go back into our lesson and give that a tick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tip if yours doesn 't let 's see what it could be if the line your pencil draws looks like it 's coming from the pencils middle you need to change your pencil sprites so the tip is in this price center click on the pencil sprite and then click on the costume down the costume so the tip of the pencil is just above the center so it 'll look like this so if yours is drawing like that make sure you do this I 'll show you in now how to do that so we 'll go back into scratch we 're already in the pencil we 'll go into the costume town and as you can see we 've got now Center dot here already but if it wasn 't there you could select the entire pencil and then move it so it is so have you some like that and then we can just move it from the center so it 's closer to the dot wait it 's gonna leave it there because it 's in the right spot now so now we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so we 're going to go on to the next step which is colored pencils so colored pencils now you 're going to add different colored pencils to your project and allow the user to choose between them so first off you need to rename the pencil sprite to pencil blue so we 'll go in and do that now so I 'm going to rename the costume for it too and so little so now we 've got until blue there now we 'll go back into our lesson we 'll give that a tick now we 're gonna scroll down now we want to right click on the pencil sprite and duplicate the pencil blue costume so I click on that and do that so I 'll go back into scratch and do that now so we 'll just right click on pencil blue giblet hey you know I 've got to alright good so now we 'll go back into our lesson and we 'll give that a tick and scroll down now we want to name the new costume pencil green in color the pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now so we 'll go back in I 'm going to change pencil blue to pencil all right and then what we can do is we can grab our fill tool we can change it to my screen color then men like oh man no pencil brainy so we 'll go back into our listen and give that a tick and we need to draw two new sprites one blue square and 1 green squid these are for choosing between the blue and green pants so we 're gonna create a blue and a green square so let 's do that man so under our new sprites we 're going to paint a sprite this time we 're just trying to grab a squint we 're going to have a green screen shrink a bit yeah we gonna make it smaller on the screen anyway we 'll call this one green man we can be a bit tricky we can duplicate this now we can call this blue we 're just going to take the fill tool now and grab blue quick thing looms put it like that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom and then we 'll go back into a lesson so we 've thrown the new sprites you 've had a tick the other thing we can do is we can shrink them down in size so we 'll go back in to scratch and show you how to do that so if you select them we can make the size so it 's a bit smaller so that 's for our green one make them then they 're much smaller so they take up as much of the screen for us okay so now we 're just going to go back into now paint box lesson and scroll down so now we want to rename the new sprites so that they are called blue and green which we 've already just done but if you forgotten how and want a refresher on how to do it you can open up him and we 'll tell you how and then we 'll give that a tick so now we 'll scroll down further we 're going to add some code to the green sprite so that when this sprite is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do a broadcast message so when this sprite clicked broadcast green as we have done a broadcast message yet if you 'd like to you can have a look in the instructions in here under broadcast a message in scratch and we 'll show you how to do it so I 'll open them up now so a broadcast is a way of sending a message from a sprite which can be heard by all sprites think of it it like an announcement made over loudspeaker send a broadcast you can send a broadcast by creating a broadcast block in giving it a name find the broadcast block under events select new message in the drop down menu then type your message the message text can be anything you like but it is useful to give the broadcast a sensible description what happens when the message is received depends on the toad you write Oh and now receiving a broadcast a sprite can react to a broadcast by using this block when I receive you can add blocks below this block to tell the sprite what to do when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say hello for two seconds okay very good just now and we 're going to add this to our scratch so we 'll go in now so back into scratch and we 're in our green block already we want to go into our code we want to go into our events and we went one when the sprite clicked and we then want to broadcast and we 'll change that from message one since we 're using the green one we 're going to broadcast Vereen okay so we 'll go back into our lesson and we 've done that and we 'll give it a dip and we 'll scroll down the pencil sprite should listen for the green message and change its costume and pencil color in response switch to your pencil spray add some code so that when this sprite receives the green broadcast the switches to the green pencil costume and changes the pin color to green so we want to add when I receive green switch costume to pencil green and set pen color to green to set the pencil to color to green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then click on the green square sprite so let 's add that now so go back into scratch we want to choose our pencil and now we want a when I receive green I know we want to grab our looks everyone switch costume to want to change that to pencil green we don 't want to go into our pen and we want to set pen color to well click on yum we can actually choose our crane from here or to make it easy if you click on the eyedropper you can choose the green there that works just as well so now if we click the green flag and see our pencil is blue and if we click on the green it 'll change it to green very good stop that one for now and go back into the lesson then we will just give that a tick then to a similar thing so that you can switch the pencil color to blue well then it should be then do a similar thing that makes more sense click on the blue square spry and head this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pencil spray and add this code which is just the opposite of the green one but blue so let 's add that now so I 'll go back into our lesson vacuum scratch we 're going to click on our blue sprite and then we kind of have and if and we wanted to broadcast well when this bat clicked broadcast and we don 't want green we want blue this time so we 'll add a new message and now we 'll go back into the pencil and then this one here it 'll be a bit tricky and we 'll right-click on that and duplicate it then all we need to do is change my nice Steve green the blue switch costume on pencil green to pencil blue and we want to set the color to blue we 'll grab the eyedropper again to make it nice and easy I 'm just clicking there now we can test it with the flag so if we draw normally it 's green we change it to the blue it 'll go blue then go back to the green it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the program and go back into our lesson monk you 've got a tick there and scroll down now finally at this code to tell the pencil sprite which color to start with and to make sure that the screen is clear when your program starts so we want above our forever loop we want race all switch costume to pencil blue and set pen color to blue so we 'll add that now it 's gonna go into our pen box we want to go erase all of the top we want to set pen color too and we 'll choose our blue like so and then we also want to switch our costumes so we go back into our looks and switch costume to pencil blue so now whenever we click the flag it 'll get rid of all that wonderful drawing I 've done and then we can draw run here and we can change and if we click the green flag again it 'll erase at all very good so we 'll stop the program for now and then we will go back up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you prefer you can start with a different colored pencil test your code can you switch between the in green pencil colors by clicking on the blue or green square sprites as we just did that works so we can give that a tick and now we 're going to go on to the first challenge which is shortcuts so just open challenge more pencils can you add red yellow and black pencils to your paint program take a look at the earliest steps if you want to Ramon to reminder how to do this can you use your pencil to draw a picture on if want to try that you can try that now adding more colors and what I 'm going to do is I 'm going to add that outside the video and when you come back to it they 'll all be there so let 's go back and check the scratch project and like magic there they are okay well now we 'll go back to our lesson and we 're going to do our next step which is undo mistakes so under undo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erase the end in a race button at the Xbox prior from the libraries letter section color the sprite costume in red and make it a little smaller this sprite is called a Clear button so if we 've forgotten how to add a sprite you can go into the options here so I 'm just gonna do that now and we 'll go into scratch we 're going to add a sprite and I 'm down our letters we 're going to get now Explorer and then we 're going to go into our costumes we 're going to grab red I 'm trying to fill that and we 're going to move it into the corner just gonna shrink that down and there we are okay so now we 're gonna go back into our lesson and give that a bit now I 'll scroll down now we want to add code to the X block sprite to clear the stage when the sprite is clicked so when the sprite is clicked erase all so let 's add that now so we 'll go back into scratch go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event for when this sprite clicked then we go down into our pen blocks and we want to erase all so now if I click on the X block here like magic it 's gone very good so now we 'll go into our lesson again and we 've done that so I 'll give that a tick we 'll scroll down you don 't need to use a broadcast to clear the stage because the erase all block does that job do you see that the pencil sprites include an eraser costume your project also includes a separate eraser sprite so right-click on this eraser sprite and then click on show here it is how here is how your stage should look now so I 'll do that now and go back into scratch so we 've got our race to 1 yeah and we 're going to change it from hide to show we 've got it down yeah we 'll go back into our lesson and we 'll give that a tick now we 'll scroll down so add code to the eraser sprite to send an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like our pencils changing them from the color sprites when the sprite clicked broadcast eraser so we 're good go do that now so we 'll go into our fence when this sprite clicked broadcast we want a new message or you 're very sad then hit OK then we 'll go back into our lesson and we 've done that so give it a tick when the pencil sprite receives the eraser message it should switch to its costume to the eraser and switch the pen color to white which is the same color as the stage so we 're going to add some code to create the eraser if you think you can do that now try that or we 'll use the hints under I 'm eating in we want add some code to the pencil spray when I have received the erase message switch to costume eraser and set pen color to white if you think you can do it from there try now we 'll see what the next tip is in the hints here are all the blocks you need set pen color to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eraser so if you think you can put that together now try that or go for the last step so this is what it should look like when I receive eraser switch costume to eraser set pen color to white so we 'll add that to our code now so we 're going to scratch we want to go into our pencil we want a when I receive that to be eraser and we want to grab a costume block so we 'll go to switch costume to race um and then we 'll grab a pen block and we 'll set pen color to we 'll make that white so just click the eyedropper and click to backstage there we are now if we test out our code if we hit the green flag we can draw we can switch it to the other colors and if they want to get rid of some of it we can erase it like so but it 's only erasing a little bit at the moment so let 's see what it says next so stop that now we 'll go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down just your project to see if you can clear the stage and erase pencil lines so I care it only gets rid of a little bit at a time so I 'll give that a tick there 's one more problem with the pencil you can draw her anywhere on the stage including near the clear and eraser buttons so if you want to you can try and but you can draw behind them like so to fix this change the code so that the pen is only down if the mouse is clicked and the Y position of the mouse pointer is greater than minus 120 so we 're going to add to our code a operator for end and greater then and a mouse Y and minus 120 in our greater than so I 'll go back into our code now so go back into scratch we want to go into our operators we want greater than and and and operator so we 'll pop this in him we 're gonna put out now stand in the front and move that across in the way and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need in our sensing mouse why so that way now if we click on the flag and test it we try to draw up here it 's fine but if we go further down won 't let us draw past that line and just stops it which is good now stop that and go back into our lesson and just scroll up and give that a tick then go down to test your project you now should not be able to draw near the buttons so we just did that so and give that a tick and now our next step is change the pencil width so in change the pen width next you will add code to allow the person using your program to draw things with different pen widths first add a new variable called with so if you can remember how to add your own variable you can do that now or you can look inside here and we 'll show you how to add a variable so I 'm going to open that up just see how to do it in here now we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratch we 're going to go into our variables we 're going to make a variable and just call it with okay so now we have our variable and we 're going to go back into our lesson and give that a tick now we 'll scroll down then we want to add this line inside the forever loop of the pencil sprites code so underneath now go to mouse pointer we want to add set pen size to width so we 'll add that now so go back into our scratch we go to our pen down the bottom and we want to set pen size to I 'll pop that underneath you and we 're just kind of put our variable width as the size then we 'll go back in our lesson and we 'll give that a tick and we 'll scroll down the pen width now repeatedly gets set to the value of the widths variable right click on the width variable displayed on the stage and then click on slider so we 'll go do that now so we 'll go back into scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go slide up now we can see down that way we 'll go back into our lesson give that a tick you can now drag the slider that is visible below the variable to change the variables value that 's such a scene so let 's test your project and see if you can add code to adjust the pen width so I 'll go back in and try that now so we 've got it on 12 which were aligned it 's much bigger 15 even bigger or if we go all the way down to it 's quite small and that works well if we want to erase so if we click on erase um we can erase little bits or we can go all the way up no race the lot in one go okay so I 'll stop that one there and go back into our lesson and give that a tick and we 'll go on to our challenge keyboard commands challenge keyboard commands can you add code so that instead of clicking on the colored squares or buttons on the stage you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch to the blue pencil G switch to the green pencil you switched to the eraser and see clear screen if you want to you can also add code so that pressing the arrow keys change the pen width so if you want to try adding those in your challenge you can try that now so if you 've completed the challenge we can go and see what 's next so click on the what 's next and what next is now that you have completed the paint box project try the podrace project which helps you make a game where you have to steer not steer a boat around obstacles so I 'll try that now with the green flag I 've got a little boat moves quite slow but if it hits those it goes faster what happens if we crash kaboom Oh No okay stop that for now so that 's the project we 'll be doing next time and that 's our sixth and final project or our beginning module so hopefully I 'll see you next time and we 're gonna see what 's next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it and I shall see you all next time have a lovely day bye for now"

    "text": "hello again everyone its Matthew from Port Stephens library we 're going to continue on from our last lesson moving on to lesson 4 the introduction to scratch if you followed last video we 'll have finished around here or now what next page for ghostbusters so we just scroll down we 'll see we 're going to try out the chapel project if you want to you can test it out by clicking on the green slanting then if you click on the character there it 'll say what 's your name why bring men I like we met man are you ok library met man yes that 's great to hear do you want to go to the moon sure let 's go yes Oh on the moon very cool so now we 've seen what it 'll do let 's gonna do one ourself so we 'll go here and click on the try out the chat bot project it will bring us up to the chat bot project so now we will scroll down and in our introduction page you are going to learn how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that is called a chat bot robot or Chaplin what you will make click on the green flag and then click on the chat box to start a conversation when the chat bot asks a question type your answer into the box at the bottom of the stage and then click on the blue mark on the right or press ENTER to see the chat BOTS reply so we 've just tested that so we won 't do that again but if you want to you can play around with that first but now we 're going to go into our steps so what we 'll need like always is a computer on capable of running scratch 3 we 're going to use the online version and if you need any files to download you can click on them there and then in what you will learn they will use code to concatenate strings in scratch that 's big word that all it means is we 're going to learn how to join different strings together but we 'll get to that in the project when we get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to store user input and also use conditional selection to respond to user input in scratch again it sounds like a lot but all it is is if you say one thing it 'll respond in a certain way but we 'll get to that the project and it 'll be really easy so like always again additional notes for educators but with that let 's begin we 're going to our introduction to our chat book so in your chat bot before you start creating your chat pod you need to decide what its personality is think about the following questions what is the chatbox name where does it live is it happy serious funny shy and Lea anything else you can think of and what does it like and dislike so have a good think about this and then when you 've decided what your chat book it 's going to be give that of eat it okay and we 'll scroll down to our first step in this will open the chat box scratch starter project so with the online one we just click on our link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's a bit different from the previous ones where it 's actually a starter project with a background and characters already in here for sprites so it 's got up the top here chat bot by RPI Foundation which is the Royals reply foundation and then when we are saving our project we 'll just remix it to create our own one so now that we 've seen all this we 'll go back into our lesson mop the top change dams and we 've done that so we 'll give that it and scroll down so the starter project contains four character sprites one of these will be your chat bot you can either use this pipe that is already selected or choose a different one by clicking the one you want and selecting the show or hide I I con from the sprite menu below the stage so there 's terror ego eco and nano so this is where you get to choose which one you 'd like to use so we 'll go back in and we 'll choose which character we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there but I don 't think I 'm going to use that once I 'm just gonna delete nano and I 'm not gonna use Pico and I 'm not gonna use you come in I 'll go with town and just to make terra visible we 're going to change it from the little eye with the lines through it to show and then there we are very good okay so after you 've chosen which character you want to use we 'll go back up to our lesson then we 'll give that a tick there we 'll scroll down and now we 're going to move on to the talking chat bot and now with the talking chat bot now that you have a chat with the personality you 're going to program it to talk to you so we 're going to click on your chat bot sprite and add this code to it so there when it 's clicked it asked for your name and then says what a lovely name these are the blocks you when this sprite clicked ask what 's your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds so let 's do that now so we 'll go back into scratch we 're on our sprite already going to go into our events in grabber when the sprite is clicked now we 're going to go into sensing which is a new one that we 're using and we 're going to ask what 's your name which is already in there just good and then we 're going to go to looks and say instead of hello what what Lee name okay so now let 's test out our chat bot so we will click on our sprite there with Carol what 's your name so we 're just gonna have Matt what a lovely name very good so now we 're going to go back into our lesson and give that a dip and now we 'll scroll down so click on your chat bot to test your code when the chat bot asks for your name type it into the box that appears at the bottom of the stage and then click on the blue mark or press Enter so that 's what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll tip that one off there but you can practice a few more times and trying with different names if you 'd like now I will go to the next step right now your chat bot replies what a lovely name every time you answer you can make the chat pods reply more personal so that the reply is different every time a different name is typed in change the chat box sprites code to join I with the answer to the what 's your name question so that the code block looks like this so I 'm going to add a join hi with the answer just in here so we 'll go back to scratch we 'll add that nano so going to going to our operators we 're going to grab a join block here and pop that in there then we 're going to go back in sensing I 'm going to grab this and so on here pop it in here okay and just click where it says Apple and click in there and then change that to hi what we need to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they both join together or you 'll have high in name there 's one so then we 'll click off there and we 'll test out our codes bow chat bot so we 'll click on our sprite what 's your name alright man and that 's my man okay very good so now we 're going to go back into our lesson click up the top we 've done that and we will then click on the tick cuz we 've done that one and scroll down so so ia storing the answer in a variable you can use it anywhere it should be in your project it 's missing the in that 's okay create a new variable called name if you can 't remember how we 've created variables in the past project you can go in here and it 's got the steps so you can follow those go in now and create a variable called name so we 're going to go back into scratch we 're going to go into our variables we 're going to make a variable and we 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go okay now we have name up the top so go back to our lesson and we 'll get that off then and scroll down now change the chatbot sprite code to set the name variable to answer we 're going to add set name to answer in between the ask and the save lock so we 'll go in there and we 'll also change answer in our join block to name as our variable sounds like a few steps but let 's see how we go so go back into our chat bot and we 're going to then goes name to and then we 're going to get now sensing and change it from 0 to and some we kinda take this hands around and Chuck that away then we 're gonna go back into variable about names can here and put it in there so now if we click and test by clicking on our chat Bob character Tara what 's your name Matt we 'll say it says hey hi Matt and it also has up here in the variable map so if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember my name so now we 've done that step we 'll go back into our lesson so click up the top and click on the dick and your coach the workers before your chatbox should say hi using the name you type in which is good so test your program again notice that the answer you type in is stored in the name variable is also shown in the top left-hand corner at the stage to make it disappear from the stage go to the variables blocks section and click on the box next to name so that it is not marked so if we go back into scratch we can also uncheck that and it 'll disappear from the top corner like so it 's no longer up here very good so I 'll go back into our lesson we 'll go to the first challenge more questions okay challenge more questions program your chatbot to ask another question can you store the answer to this new question in a new variable so the question here there means asked is where do you live I 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I might add this one to mine but if you think of any other questions you 'd like to try you can definitely do those so I 'll quickly add this one to it and show you how I 'll go back into our scratch project just at the bottom we 're going to be very very tricky and copy these over so we 're gonna duplicate those and we 're going to change what 's your name where do you live and then we 're going to a new variable called place made my dad take place and then we 're going to set place as answer because answer will change to the most recent question we 've done so whine answer what 's your name and then we 're going to join place instead of name so I 'll get rid of this copy of name we 're going to change to live too and remember the space after or it 'll join all together so now we 'll test again so we 're going to click on our chat box prying what 's your name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live in the library not really but that 's where I live at the most I 've never been to library well it 's a nice place so you should visit okay so we 'll go back to our lesson and we 'll scroll down we 've added that question so if you want to add any more definitely add more but we 're going to do the next step of making decisions so making decisions you can program your Chapel to decide what to do based on the answer it receives first you 're going to make a chapel ask a question that can be answered with yes or no so I 'm going to change your chat box code the chat box should ask the question are you okay name using the name variable then it should reply that 's great to hear yes the answer is received is yes but say nothing if the answer is none so are you okay yes that 's great to hear well scroll down so underneath where we 've got our original question and any additional questions so just add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask join are you okay name and wait if answer equals yes then say that 's great to hear for two seconds and after we do that we 're going to test your code new code properly you should test it twice once with the NCS and once with the incident just to make sure it 's right so we 'll go in and we 're going to do that now so go into your project so when going back into the project we 're just going to grab a ask in from our sensing what 's your name where it says that and pop that in and we 're going to then grab hey operator join me now operator we 're going to join ah okay don 't just face at the end and then we 're going to crown our variable for name so it 's asking whether the name we 've put in there you okay and then we 're going to go into our control blocks we 're going to grab that if then and in the if then we 're going to grab an operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to if our answer was yes so then we need to grab another answer block so we can either go into sensing have one from here pop that in there so if ants equals yes then we 're going to go back into looks we 're going to gather say for two seconds we 're going to change that too that 's great to hear okay so now let 's test out our code so we 'll click on now chat bot hey what 's your name Matt hi Matt ready lives why breathe so I 'm gonna put that in there are you okay man yes I am that 's great to you so that works there now if we test it once more what 's your name I 'm going to be mad again and then where do I lose till here the library and are you okay no okay and the chap what doesn 't say anything so that works like that very loose so now we 're gonna go back into our lesson and click up the top well scroll down oh well we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've finished that one and scroll all the way down at the moment your chat bot doesn 't say anything to the answer no change your chat BOTS codes that it replies oh no if it receives no is the answer to that are you okay name replace the IFS then block with an if and else block and include codes that the chat bot can say Oh No so we 're going to get rid of our if then block and replace it with an if-then-else we 're also going to add a say oh no for two seconds so we 'll go back into scratch now and do that so we want to keep now operator without answering yes and we also want to keep our say that 's great for you we don 't need this if then block so we 'll get rid of that that in then we 'll go back into our control and we 're going to grab an if-then-else block and we want our answer equals yes off the top again and say that 's great to hear again then we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'll duplicate that pop that underneath we 're gonna change it to Oh No so now if we go in and we test our chat bot so click then what 's your name not millions library now this time if we say no oh no a chapel responds so that 's working very well so we 're gonna go back into our lesson now scroll up and tick then now we 're gonna scroll back down so now we 're going to do chest for code you should get different responses when you answer no and when you answer yes your chat box should reply with that 's great to hear when you answer yes which is not case-sensitive and reply with oh no when you answer anything else so as we tested that that 's what it does so he can pick that one as well and scroll all the way down you can put any code inside and if then else block not just codes to make your Chapel speak if you click your chat box costume tab you 'll see that there is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box code so that the chat box switches costumes when you type in your answer so we 've got a happy face so that 's great to hear and a Rumpy face for when it 's a No so we 're going to change the code inside the if then else blocks to switch costume so we 're just going switch costume to nano sea or nano D whereas I 'm not using nano so I 'll find out which costumes dip but we 'll go in there and do that now so go back into scratch and then we 're going to go into our costumes and just have a look at which ones we 've got so I 'm gonna smile in terror for a and they 're really happy terror for be excited tear of a C and I 'm not so happy I 'm 13 so I think we 'll need a happy B and grumpy D so terror B will be our happy and Tara D will be our grumpy so we 'll go in and do that now so go back into our code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just switch costume inside and out say that 's great to hear we want that to be Tara B and then we 're going to grab a switch costume Tara D for the Oh No so now we 'll test that again so we 'll click on Tara what 's your name if it 's Matt well it means the library are you again yes looking very happy now if we test it again ah still happening well we can fix them afterwards I think so I 'm at end at the library let 's say the Nile Oh No looking bumpy there so now if we want to at the very top of now code can switch costume Oh sneak that one in there after Tara Amy so when we restart the program each time and click on Tara she 'll go back to her normal face stop now we 'll go back into our project so we 'll scroll all the way up as we 've done that well click the tick and we 'll scroll down have you noticed that after your chatbox costume has changed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was at the beginning you can try this out run your code in answer No so that your chatbots face changes to an unhappy look then run your code again and notice that your chat book the chat bot does not change back to looking happy before it asks your name so to fix this problem and this chatbot code to switch costumes at the start when the sprite is clicked when the sprite is clicked switch costume to nano a and just before our ask for tuning and then it 'll go back to normal face which we 've just done before that step which was you know anyway so we 'll just tick that one off but if you want to there at the steps for how we did it so I 'll tick that there now we 're going to scroll down and the next challenge is more decisions so I 'll click on more decisions and program your chat bot plus another question that can be answered with yes or no and you make your chat bot respond differently depending on which answer it receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think of any no answers that you can add to your chat pod you can do that now pick up some creative ones maybe choose your best joke to add in there with that question I 'll leave that one Q to see if you can figure out on your own and see how you go but hopefully he can come up some with some really good ones so we 're going to now go to our next step which is changing locations so under changing location you can also program your chat bot to change its location can you program your chat bot to ask do you want to go to the moon and then change the backdrop when the answer is yes so if you think you can do that try that now or we can go on to the hints so I 'm that I need a hint you 're a chat bot should ask do you want to go to the moon and if you answer yes should switch the backdrop to the moon so if you think from these steps you can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in the against Oh with the next step and against here are the code blocks you need to add to your chat block code switch backdrop to moon ask do you want to go to the moon and wait if answer equals yes then so if you think from that you can figure it out see how you go or we 'll go to the last step and show us how so go there now so this is what your code should look like ask do you want to go to the moon and wait if answer equals yes then switch back drop to noon so we 'll add that two hours now we 'll go back into scratch mom scrolled in because our codes getting quite lengthy now we 're going to sensing and we 're going to ask now we 're going to have our control blocks and an if-then then we 're gonna drive out offer operator we want an equals and we want our sensing for our answer and if the answer equals yes and we 're going to go to our looks but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to go switch backdrop to moon because we 've already got another one in there if you look under your backdrops we 've got both moon and space we 'll go back into our code at error and we 'll test that out now so if we click on terror will answer all our questions so what 's your name mass and where do you live and are we okay we are okay and would you like to go to the moon yes and look we 're now at the moon and we 're looking pretty happy please so now we 're gonna go back to a now listen look young and we 've done that step so in quickly so we 'll scroll down now you may need to make sure your chat what starts in the right location when you click on it to talk to it and this block to the top of your chat or cone so when this right clicked switch back drop to space so just like changing the costume for our character we also need to switch the backdrop so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scroll to the top and switch backdrop to we 'll change it from moon to space there we are so now when we click to start again we 'll go back to where we were okay so now we 're going to go back into our lesson and give that a tick and scroll down test your program in answer yes when the chat bot asks if you want to go to noon you should see that the chat box location changes so we 've done that and if you want to do it again you can try that now and then we 'll give that a tip you can also add the following code inside the new if block to make the chat book jump up and down four times if your answer yes so we want to add a repeat block we want to change Y by 10 and then we want to wait 0.1 seconds and change Y by minus 10 and then wait 0.1 seconds and this repeat of Y access up and y-axis down will make out her to John so let 's try that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't scroll all the way down to where our moon is going to grab a control we 're going to grab a repeat block you want to repeat four times we also want to wait blocks so pop those in main manner and we 'll change those to 0.1 and 0.1 then we want to go into our motion I 'm going to change Y by put that above we want another change Y by and we want to PI and and also by minus 10 so now we can test out now tarah chatbot so click then and we 'll go through all our different ones each time you do it you can change where your name and where you live whatever you want to do yes in happy and we 're on the moon and we jump it up and go down very good so we 'll go back to our listen now and we 'll tick that off there and then the final challenge is finish your chap so in challenge finish your chat but use what you 've learned to finish creating your interactive chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say do you want to sing with me so I can do a song should I be ants maybe some popping around the screen should I put on my hat maybe put a hat on your character change some costumes once you 've finished for chatbot get your friends to have a conversation with it do they like your character can they spot any problems so think of any other ideas that you can a chatbot to ask other questions change backgrounds whatever you want to do be very creative and then we 'll see what 's next so with our what next try the paint box project where you will create your own painting program click on the green flag to start use the mouse to move the pencil and hold down the left mouse button to draw click on a color to change pencils click on the eraser to change to it and use it to erase your work to clear the page click on the cross so quickly test that out now so green flag you can draw around with some blue maybe some green change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid of some of that I want to clear the whole page very cool so that 's what we will be doing for our next lesson lesson five so let 's see what 's next now congrats project completed so you 've now completed project number four so till next time I hope to be seeing you all and enjoy the rest of you"

    "text": "hello again everyone its Matthew from Port Stephens Larry here we are going to continue on from in a last lesson and move on to lesson two the introduction to scratch so if you follow now last video you 'll have end it around here so under our next tab now that you 've built your first scratch project why not take a look at the lost in space scratch project so we 're just gonna click on this link here to take us there okay so when that loads we are now on to our lost in space project and in the introduction you are going to learn how to program your own animation what you will make click on the green flag to see the animation and a monkey spinning in a star and the ship flying towards the Earth very cool so what you will need just like the first lesson a computer capable of running scratch 3 which if you 've done the first one you can do this one to software scratch 3 again we 're going to use the online version and no downloads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will learn to use a repeat loop to animate a sprite and scratch use a forever loop to repeat an animation indefinitely and understand that loops can be nested within each other very cool and then again additional information for educators in there so let 's go forward so first step is animating a spaceship your first step will be to create a spaceship that flies towards the earth so again we will open a new scratch project like the first one so we 'll just click on this link for the online one when it loads in will just go to the top and click on create and like last time logged in up the top and if you don 't have an account and you want to create one just check with your parents because you need to use an email address now we 'll just switch back from our tab for scratch and we 'll go back to our lessons have oh yeah and will tick that off again so now I 've got two things to do we go to add a rocket ship and Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lesson how to do that if not you got the instructions in here so we 'll add the earth and the rocketship I 'm gonna go back into scotch get rid of scratch cap because we don 't know it him delete and add a sprite if we search up here in the top third earth there we are move into the top corner no go back in and choose the sprite go spaceship just as we should saying finds it anyway okay so we 'll go back to our listen time and put there and put a tick on that one and again if you 've got anything out just a little bit there and it 'll show you how to write so now we 're going to add the stars back up to your stage and just like last time we 'll add another backdrop so we 'll go back into scratch victim a tab in to use a backdrop and we 've actually got one up here called space smoke they click on there you 'll be able to see stars down here we 'll click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our listen Taman yen put a tick on that now we want to click on your spaceship spray and click on the costume tab so we 'll go back in to scratch choose our spaceship choose costume over here now is selected I 'll go back into our lesson and it 's the tick and scroll down so now we 're going to use the arrow tool to click and drag a box around the whole spaceship image then click on the circular rotate handle and rotate the image until it is on its side so I 'm gonna select it all and then use this little rotate one so let 's see how that it 's done go back into scratch are we going to click and drag around the spaceship like that let go then we 'll see this little rotate arrow there and we 'll just rotate it space in sideways there we are changes what else it looks like very good now we 'll go back into our listen and listen click on the tick him scroll down and now we 're going to add this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of code there so we 'll see how we go so when flag clicked point in Direction go to X minus 150 Y minus 150 so we 'll start with that part and come back so go into scratch go into our code and we 'll go into our events for our when flag clicked and drag that over then we 'll go into our motion for our light blue ones and then we 're going to choose our pointing direction drank an oval we want a pointing direction for syrup pop that in there and then we 're going to go to X Y we 're going to go minus 150 and minus 150 many people upon that it 'll change what our ship does and put him down here okay so now we 're going to go over to our looks tab to the left and click that we 're going to grab now saying hello for two seconds and change it from hello to little oh now we 'll go back to our listen tab and see what 's next so we 're going to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y zero so we 'll go back in I 'm trying to go to our motion we 're going to point towards I 'm gonna change it from mouse pointer to Earth never going to change slide 1 second 2 X 2 0 and 0 and now if we press the green flag we 'll see how it says let 's go it 's gonna fly towards the Earth okay so now we 're going to go back into our lesson you just click up on its armor now we 've completed this we just kind of click on that it and scroll down so if you click the green flag like we did you should save this spaceship speak and anybody towards the center of the stage which is people so we 'll go me out to our challenge improve your animation so in our challenge improve your animation and you change the numbers in your animation code so that the spaceship moves until it touches the earth and also the spaceship moves more slowly towards leanness so you 'll need to change the numbers in this block so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to glide for and where it 's going to ride to so to help us with where we should make the ship glide to on the XY axis we can have a look at our scratch ordinance so if you click on this and open it up it 'll have a example of how the scratch coordinates work so in scratch the coordinates X 0 y 0 mark the central position on the stage a position like my X minus 200 in Y minus 100 is towards the bottom left on the stage in a position like X 200 Y 100 is near the top right so you can see that on the example there on the XY axis so UI is up the top 180 and down the bottom minus 180 and then PX access on the left hand side it 's minus 240 and on the right hand side it 's 240 so you can see this for yourself by adding the XY grid back down to your project so if you want to have a look at that I 'll show you how we 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our XY access so you don 't expire you can see your grid and if you bring that up you can see the grid day being though that you want our stars backdrop we 'll just move that Mac so we 'll go up to here on next week own so click on backdrops then we 'll choose our stars and it 'll go to black and we 'll go back to our code we 're now going to change the code in our rocket ship so we 're going to go over and change how long now she was fine glide for so we might make it 4 seconds and then without x-axis we 're going to make it a hundred eighty and then for our y-axis will try 150 I 'll see what that looks like now trying to pressing the green flag again now rocket ships flying towards yes and it 's can 't be further than we would like so we can then go back and we can change it in reduce now why access to say 120 now x-axis to 115 and then try the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's much better so I 'll leave it at that okay so after we have done that challenge you can of course little more and it goes faster by reducing the time it glides or make it go a lot slower by increasing it but we 're going to go on to the next step so back to a lesson and then now we 're going to go animation using loops so animation using loops another way to animate the spaceship is to tell it to move a small amount many times so if you 've played around with the glide block block for a while we 're now gonna get rid of it anyway so delete the glide block from your code to do this drag the block off the code area and drop it back where the other single code blocks are so we 'll go back into scratch I 'm gonna grab this and Chuck it see you later and done now we 're gonna go back to our listen PL and we 're gonna give them the ticket so now use a repeat block to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repeat block I 'm going to put it in there so where we 've already got our code we 're going to add this video so going to repeat 200 move two steps so I 'll go vacuum then finders so under our event code it 's a dark orange control block will grab the repeat 10 yeah we 're gonna change it from 10 to 200 and then we 're gonna go into our motion blocks they 're gonna move we 're gonna change it to 2 steps now let 's test it and see what happens let now ship and I 'll fly look there go towards yes hands are out of on top perfect yeah we 're good back when I listen scroll down so a test and save your code your spaceship should move towards the earth exactly as before but this time it uses a repeat block so quickly scroll back we 'll go back down so next add code to your spaceship sprite so that the spaceship changes color as it moves towards us use this book so inside our Luke we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color effect by 25 so color effect will be in our looks so we 'll go back into scratch we 're going to our looks well fine I 'll change color effect which is down the bottom and grab that put that in here now let 's press play and see what happens so click on the green flag no ship does it that 's changing dollars it 's looking pretty funky why I 'm towards here very good so now we 'll go back into our lesson give that one a tick and scroll down now let 's try this can you make your spaceship get smaller as it moves towards us so you can now either have a try of that on your own or we 'll have a look and see what we can chose it now to do so well click in and we 'll see your spaceship size starts at 100% size and then change size by a small amount each time it moves so do you think that hen will help or we can grab another one by clicking on the arrow cross so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so change size by 10 and set size or I can percent if you know where you can put these two blocks you can try now we 'll see what the next in is well go across it shows us where to put them so our set size 400% goes way at the top just below the when the flag clicked button and then our change size by minus 3 goes at the bottom under our change color event so let 's pop those in now and see what happens so we 're going to scratch then we 'll go now set size to 100% way up let 's up then hope that in it now we want to change size by pop that underneath now change color and then we 're gonna put in minus three so now let 's have a look and say what happens when we press the flag so let 's go oh and it 's flying off a bit ago very good we barely see it now looks like it 's landed on the earth okay well now we 'll go back to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scroll down now test and save your code your spaceship should now get smaller as it moves test your spaceship a second time is it the right size when it starts so test it once more insane well Chris the green flag goes back to the right size and it 's flying off very good and we 'll go back to our listen they 're going to be now next adding the floating monkey okay so with the floating monkey now you 'll add a monkey who 's lost in space to your animation so first off we 'll start adding the monkey sprite from the library so we 'll do that first go back into scratch choose a sprite I 'm the monkey there is no owl monkeys in space very good go back to the lesson scroll down Oh picking off that one so click on your new monkey sprite and then click on costumes so that you can edit how the monkey looks so set the film to be transparent by selecting the red line for the outlines a white color by moving the saturation slider to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale or moving saturation all the way to the left so do that first so chose now monkey we 're gonna go into our costumes you know choose red for the outline birth of the feel sorry and we 'll move that saturation all the way to the left and all right color so now we 'll go back in we 're gonna tick and our boss and scroll down now we 're going to click on the circle tool and then use it to draw white space helmet around the monkeys head he 'll need that in stuck in space so I 'll go back in and we 're going to scroll down and choose circle and draw him helmet there we are so as you can see on here he 's got his helmet so to go back to our listen and then scroll down Oh take that first scroll down now can you add code to your monkey sprite so that it spins slowly in a circle forever so if you think you can do that you can try that or we 'll see what the hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the green flag is clicked your monkey sprite should turn in a circle forever so if you think you know from that you can try or we 'll try the next int go across here out the code blocks you 're made so you 'll need a forever block a turn 15 degrees block and when flag clicked so ever think you can do it from me we 'll check the last teams so this is what our code should look like so we 'll try putting that in now when flag clicked forever turn 1 degree so we 'll go back into scratch we 've already selected our monkey or go into our code I 'll kill and then we 're going to go into our events first get up when flag clicked then we 're going to go into our control we 're going to get a forever block so it 'll loop it now in our motion look young we want to turn and then we 're going to change it from 15 degrees to 1 degrees you might just move our monkey up here a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh she 's doing it 's flying and our monkeys slowly spinning in space maybe selling out of a ship what was that to me and we 'll go back to our listen give attitude then remember to test and save your project you 'll have to click on the red stop button turn the Istana nation as it runs forever keep spinning and spinning and spinning so now we 're going to move on to our next thing the bouncing asteroid so with our bouncing asteroid now you will add a floating space rock to your animation so first we 're going to add a rock sprite to your animation so we 're going to go in we 're going to add a sprite no doubt a rock well such rock there they are my rocks they 're good listen don 't get mad at it and scroll down now let 's say can you add code through your rock sprites so that the rock bounces around the stage you think you can do that try doing that now or we 'll use that I need a hint soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag is clicked your rocks splash to move and bounce around the stage forever sort of like the monkey spins if you can tell how to do it from there we 'll try the next lesson since no cross so here are the code blocks you 'll need you 'll need a move ten steps if on edge bounce when flag clicked and a forever you can also set a more interesting starting direction for the rock sprite with one of these blocks so you can have it turning 15 degrees or you can have it pointing towards of it so let 's see if you can do it from an oar we 'll see what the last hint is they 've got the code for making your rock bounce across the stage so when flag clicked point towards Earth and then it 's further going to move two steps if on edge bounce so we 'll add that now to the rock so back into scratch first off we 're going to grab our events when flag clicked and then we 're going to grab our motion we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse pointer to Earth and then we need our control me one out forever you know we 're going to go back into motion am I going to have it move we only wanted moving slowly so we 're going to have two steps and then our new block just further down so you have to scroll down on here so you click and drag or just scroll with your mouse wheel then you want to do this if on edge bounce and put it under then now let 's test what it looks like with scream Frank Levin our monkey spinning now she 's flying towards the Earth now asteroid bouncing around really funky well pause that for now okay listen then go up a bit tick that and scroll down now I think this is our last part of our animation we want to make a shining star so with our shining star now you will combine loops to make a shining star so first off we 're going to add a star sprite to your stage so just like all the other ones I 'm gonna go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to search star and widest are so now I 'll go back into the lesson and we 'll check that one off and we can scroll down can you add code to your star sprite to make the star repeatedly grow and shrink you think you can do that you can try and then we 'll try and see what our answer I need a hint when the green flag is clicked your star sprites should change signs you get bigger a few times and then change size to get smaller a few times it should do this so that it gets bigger and then smaller forever and looks like it 's shining light so if you think from those you can figure that out you can try we 'll go to the next lesson tip so we 'll go across so here are the code blocks you need so a repeat block a wind flag clicked another afflict Pete block change size buying another change size by in a forever repeat so if from those ones you can figure it out you can try Oh we 'll go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's the code to make your star grow and shrink so we want win flag clicked and we want a forever and then inside of our forever we want two repeats 20 and we wanted to change size by 2 and then we want in the second one change size by 2 so let 's put that he now star me so we 'll go back into scratch we 're already on our star we 'll go into the our events we won 't when flag clicked then we are going to our control now we need a forever loop so pop that in there then we need to repeat loops of all two of those in there we 'll change them from 10 to 20 then we 'll go into our looks and then and we want to grab our change size by need two of those we 're going to make it by 2 and then in the second one minus 2 so now we all click on the green flag and test it out we can see the star looks like it 's shining right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it now we 'll stop that for now we 'll just go back into our listen scroll up and give that a tick and now the challenge is make your own animation click on there so challenge to make your own animation stop your space animation save it and start a new scratch project use what you 've learned in this protein animation can be anything you like but try to make your animation match the background you choose here are some examples of a spooky ghost going through the spooky forest and a little character jumping up and down on a trampoline so let your creativity go and make up something really funky for us all to see so now let 's have a look at sport what 's next for us so what next is try the Ghostbusters project in that project you will learn how to create a game with ghosts that will appear all over the place that you need to catch you 'll also learn how to add a timer and a score to the game so that you can see how many ghosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flag and see how it works so you 've got a school go click on the ghost making some noises action very cool so next lesson we do will be our Ghostbusters project so what 's next so congrats project completed you 've completed lesson two and hopefully I 'll see you all for lesson three so till next time have a nice day bye for now you"

    "text": "hello it 's Matthew from the Port Stephens library today we are going to start with us in one of code Club Australia 's first module of scratch first off we 're going to open our web browser and we 're going to search for total Australia just up here like this I 've already searched it there and just click on them so now after the search results to come up we just want to open a club a org just like that one there and we 'll get the code club Australia site so then up the top in almost the middle they 'll be the projects just click on that and then scroll down a little bit and you 'll say see all scratch projects so we 'll click on that one there and we 'll have module one in our first lesson here is learn how to code your own musical instruments so we 'll just click on that one there so the name of the actual modules first lesson is called rock band and we 're just going to start the project here so just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock band we have how to code your own musical instruments and what we 'll make so here 's a brief little overview of what it 'll look like maybe in the end so we just click on the green flag here you can see we 've got a little character here and we if we click on them if we click on the drum I 'll make a noise and if we click on the little symbol so now we just roll down a bit and if we click on that what you will learn we 'll find out we 're going to use code to change a sprites costume in scratch we 're going to use code to make sprites react to input in scratch and we 're going to add sounds to a sprite in scratch what you will need is a computer capable of running scratch sorry so your unlink you 're watching this you 're probably good to go and then the software is a scratch three either online or offline we 'll be using the online version so in this amount additional information in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we 'll just click on our introduction down here and we 're up to our eights so before you can start coding you 'll need to add in a thing to code in scratch these things are called sprites so we 're going to open a new scratch project to do that we 're using the online version we 're just going to open a new online scratch project by clicking on this link and we 'll open up a new tab up here so we 're creating our project so this is what scratch looks like if you already have an account on scratch and you 've used it before you might be logged in whereas I 've got one up here library madman but you 'll notice that we 've still got our other tab open here for Rock bin so if you move your mouse to the top left hand side you 'll see that it 's still up there and we can then click between the two and switch so now we 've had a little look at scratch we 're just gonna go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a tick on that because we 've opened up our scratch project and we 're just gonna scroll down and the first thing to do is the cat sprite that you can see is the scratch mascot you don 't need it for this game so get rid of it by right-clicking it and then clicking on delete so we 'll go back into scratch and we 'll just go down here we can right-click and delete or alternatively we can just click on the little trash can in the corner and he 'll disappear and he 's gone so now we 'll go back to our lesson and we 'll put a tick there okay so next click on choose sprite from library to open up a list of all the scratch sprites so if you look here this that all choose a sprite we go back to scratch it 's just down here in the bottom right hand corner then we go choose sprite then we 'll go back to lesson and put it there scroll down a bit further on so scroll down until you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your project so we 'll go back into scratch we 're just gonna scroll down until we find the drum it 's alphabetical so just throw daddy in a bit further and I 'm going to use this trouble myself so we 'll just click on that medical appear over here in our stage so now we 'll just go back to listen and put a tick there so next we 're going to click and drag the drum to the bottom of the stage so we 're going to go back in scratch and we 're going to click and drag the drum down the bottom and then back to the lesson and dick now give your program a name by typing into the text box at the top then we 're going to click on file and then save now to save your project if you 're not online or don 't have a scratch account you can save a copy of your project by clicking on save to your computer instead so we 'll go back to scratch and we 're just gonna give it a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to go file and save now if you want logged on and you don 't have a scratch account you can save it to your computer here or you can ask your parents and you can create an account so we 'll just go save now and as you 'll see project saved so now I 'm just gonna go back to the lesson and then since we 've done that I 'm going to yep the tick button then we 're going to go to the next one the stage so after clicking this stage we 'll come up with our next steps the stage is the area on the right is where your project comes to life think of it as a performance area just like a real stage at the moment the stage is white and looks pretty boring I have a backdrop to it by clicking on choose a backdrop so I 'm go back into scratch if we just go next to where our choose the sprite in as well have choose a backdrop and click on there and then we 'll go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to click on indoors in the list at the top then click on a theater backdrop so back into scratch go up the top here we 've got indoors and then we want the theater there we are smelling our backdrop go back into our listen and tick so your stage should now look similar to this so that looks pretty similar removes the trauma the side of it and then we 'll go back antic now we 're gonna go to our next step making a drum now you will add code to your drum so that the drum makes sound when it 's clicked you can find the code blocks in the scripts tab and they are all color coded so that makes it nice and easy so first add the music extension so you can play instruments click on the add extension button in the bottom left-hand corner so this little one you know we 're just gonna go back we go down to the bottom left-hand corner we can see the extensions add extensions which is kind of click on the music one so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and see click on the music extension down at which we 've just done so we can click tick up there it 's a bit of a long one there so scroll down further click on the drum spray and then drag these two blocks into the code area on the right sorry more when this sprite clicked and we want play drum snare drum so we 'll say this is an orange one which is an event and the other one is a music one so we 'll go in there we 're going our left hand side find our events click on there you want when this front is clicked so we 'll click and drag that across and place it down and then we 'll go down to our music section down the bottom click there and play drum and clip it in underneath just like Lego then we 'll go back to Alice and we 'll make sure that the blocks are connected like Lego blocks now as we said so now we can click dig now let 's click on the drum to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratch just click on the drum and as you can hear it 's making a noise we 'll go back to our lesson tick and then we 're going to do the challenge and improve your drum so in the challenge improving your drum can you change the sound the drum makes when it 's clicked so we go back into scratch and we click just here on the arrow next to snare drum you can change it to a different one so let 's make Bongo now if we click on the bongo make a different noise then if we go back into the lesson see what else it wants us to do can you also get the drum to make a sound when the spacebar is pressed you 'll need to use this event block when space key pressed you want to copy your existing code right click on it and then click on duplicate so let 's try that we 'll go back into scratch we just need to go and grab a new event block so just under our blocks in the left hand side we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to right click here on our music or play drum and duplicate that then we can pop it underneath the win stay pressed now we can change that as well to something else so let 's make this play a conga and now I 'm gonna press spacebar on the keyboard and as you can say it 's making a different noise so we 'll go back into our lesson and that 's our challenge so now next step is making a singer so now you will add a singer to your band how to sing a sprite to your stage so if you remember how we add it now drum will go back into scratch we 'll go down to the right hand side and choose a sprite will find our singer nice easy way to do that he 's been clicking our search bar up the top and we can write in the singer and there she is so now I 'll click and drag her over the other side not too close to the instruments and then we 'll go back to our lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer sing you need to add a sound here singer sprite make sure that you have selected your singers Pro then click on the sound tab and click on us and choose a sound so I 'll just do that so we 'll go back to scratch we 've selected house you know we 'll go up here to our sounds tab there and if we just go down to the bottom left hand corner we 'll have choose the sound not just about our lesson then in here or give had a tick and scroll down so now we 're going to click on voice in the list at the top and then choose a sound to add to your spring go back and do that it 's off the top right down the end we 've got voice or clip there and we 're going to find one single choose that one there now we 've got a singer voice listen and give that a tick so we 'll scroll down to use the sound and the following code blocks to your singer sprite when the sprite is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to scratch we 'll go back to our code tab and then we 'll choose when this right clicked this mic without drama and then we 'll go into the one just above it our sound tab will play sound singer one until done then we 'll go back to our listen well give that a dick and now we 'll click on your singer on the stage and see what happens as she sing let 's test it out she does so now we 'll go back to our listen and we 'll give that a tick now we 're gonna go on to our next bit costumes so now you will make your singer look like you 're singing you can change how your singer sprite looks when it 's clicked by creating a new costume click on the costume tab and you 'll see the singers cost you don 't have a look between our curtains sound town so we 'll go in there so just back to scratch I 'm going to costume and we can see her there so we 'll go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scroll down so now we right-click on the costume and then click on duplicate to create a copy of it so let 's go back and do that go back into scratch just right click over here in duplicate now we have two different ones that look the same at the moment so we 'll go back to our lesson and we 'll give that a tick and we 'll scroll down and click on the new costume called singer 2 and then select the line tool and draw lines so it looks like your singer is making a sound we 'll go back in and do that so back into row and choose singer to select the line tool down here and we 'll draw some lines so it looks like this singing not very good lines but doesn 't matter we 'll go back to our lesson and we 'll give that a tick and we 'll scroll down the names of the costumes aren 't very helpful at the moment type into the DX boxes of the costumes to change their names to not singing and singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll change our singing 1 singing well click on our other one and change that to not singing yeah go back to our lesson you give that a dick you scroll down now that you have two different costumes for your singer you can choose which costume is displayed add these two code blocks to your singer sprite so we 're going down a switch costume to singing in a switch costume to not singing between the other side of the play sound singer 1 and the code blocks for changing the costume is in the looks section so we 're good do that now so we 'll go back to scratch go into our code tab go into our looks we 'll go switch costume to singing and put that above play sound which just clips in place we 'll grab another one switch costume just singing and we 'll change that to not singing I 'll go back to our listen Thank You fati tick now click on your singer on the stage does she look like she 's singing let 's find out we 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes looks like she 's singing now very good so we 'll go back to our lesson you know give that a tick now make your drum look like it 's being hit we 'll use the instructions for changing your singer sprite it 's cost him to help you remember to test that your new code works and we 'll try that out now we 'll go back into scratch and now we 're going to select our drum then if we go into our drama costumes we 'll see that it 's already got Treme and drum be and drum be looks like it 's being hit so we 'll go back to our code and in looks we 'll switch our costume when looking the sprite to Tom B and we 'll switch it to drum a afterwards so that out the way same way and now if I try clicking on the drum looks like it 's being hit now we can go back to our lesson and take that and now there 's a challenge improve your band so under challenge improve your band use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own band you can create any instruments do you like look at the available instrument sprites and sounds to get some ideas so there 's quite a few in there and here 's an example when this sprite clicked instrument to piano play note your instruments don 't have to be realistic though for example you could make the piano made out of muffins that sounds fun you can use more sprites from the library and you can also paint your own spy so under choosing sprite just go up and you can draw your own if you 're having issues with the sprite jumping up and down it it 's got some instructions here when creating your own sprocket if you have a microphone you can record your own sounds and you can even use a webcam to hit your instruments with motion control quite fun so after you 've played around and made your own one and created all the other instrument you want what 's next after that so let 's find out so what 's next is now that you 've built your first scratch project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project click on the green flag to see the animation let 's see what it looks like so next lesson we do we 'll actually be doing this lost in space animation project so until next time congratulations you 've completed the first project I 'll see you all at the next

Mack from boys and girls advisors your advisors your deputy principals your principal mr. Lee or just attention you can trust outside of school you can find other agencies like the neighborhood set of Lord Stevens family support your local doctor or friends or family that you trust there are people in services to talk to you about your mental health and to know that it 's okay not to be okay being a good friend it means to sit down and listen to them and ask them if they are okay and not to judge them and give them the support that they need"

and if you do need that extra help grant will be available to provide that for you after this session um if you have questions or want to progress further on this so sit back enjoy um enjoy the learning and i 'm sorry i can 't see you all at the moment but um as grant said they 're working on that yeah okay okay well a little bit about about me um i 'm the managing director of brand local um i 've had 30 years experience really in marketing and i guess it shows my age that i was around in marketing before uh the internet or before the internet was mainstream and i really um learned the craft of marketing really in uh tv and and radio and also to in obviously in print and back in those days it was very very hard you had to work very hard to get people to um you know to really uh engage and convert people because you didn 't really have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days in terms of reading your target audience but it 's also too a lot more difficult in the context that we 're in a very um i guess cluttered environment so if you 're marketing in search or marketing in social it 's very competitive uh highly competitive so i guess it 's it 's double-edged swords you 've got a better connection to your target audience but you 've got to cut through all of that clutter so just if everyone can let me know if you can hear me on the uh on the microphone okay just in chat beautiful okay now today really with google and i guess this is one of the reasons why i got invited to speak uh with google on stage was that if you 've done any google seminars google 's very technical and they talk about how you actually get visibility and for a lot of people it 's all about visibility and for me visibility is only really part of the journey i mean it 's it 's okay to be seen by ten thousand people but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's really about the quality of your content it 's the quality of your messaging how you position yourself online but most importantly too how you convert people so today obviously we 're going to focus on google uh and very much on organic strategy um there 's obviously page strategy and i 'll touch on that as we move through but it 's really important to think of google just as a platform uh just like social media as a platform and they 're very different in the way that you approach but they 're a platform and really in marketing and the first part of this webinar really is about marketing because if you don 't understand the marketing uh i guess drivers or levers that you need to use you 're only really aiming for visibility so everything that i really do is around about trying to increase conversion rates and in many cases and as i move through the webinar you 'll see that you 're not necessarily converting on google so really if you 're in social media or you 're in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of that environment as quickly as possible and as i touched on earlier it 's very very distracting so if you 're in social media you 've got to get people away from that distraction so even though this is a google webinar it 's very very highly focused on converting off listing so off your google listing so a little bit about uh about me um i 've got 30 years experience as i said before and trusted by google i was actually engaged by google to start google 's first trusted agency for street view in australia and new zealand and italy so we set those up back around 2015 when google my business really first came to australia the last really i guess 15 to 20 years i 've really been in architecture and developing sales funnels and really being able to take somebody i guess it 's the psychology of really taking someone from an environment they 're in and then convincing them that they need your product and then convincing them that you 're the only one or the best one to deliver on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop uh platforms an integration of platforms like messenger chatbots ai through landing pages and then link those all back into platforms at the top of the funnel like social media or search and it 's a really important thing i think a lot of webinars that i 've done before people talk about i guess the the approach or the science behind things but the real practicality of actually developing systems and testing systems and really finding out the nuances of what works and what doesn 't work you really need to be hands-on i think to really understand that um and obviously two content creators are very strong in the area of video um graphics and designs and and graphic design and uh and visual so they 're all the attributes i guess that i bring together to develop systems and as i said earlier that success on google isn 't just what you do on google it 's what you do when you take people off google and you 'll see that as we move through the presentation one of the things i always say to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to be if you 're going to be in marketing and one is a platform so it doesn 't matter what platform you 're using whether it be google whether using paid organic whether you 're using youtube social media linkedin you must have a very technical understanding of the platform if you 're managing your own marketing but where a lot of businesses i think go wrong in marketing is that they really focus on understanding what they need to know just to get the job done in terms of of getting their message out they understand their product really well but they really don 't take the time to really understand understand their target audience and that 's probably one of the most important things that you really need to understand you really need to understand people their behaviors their needs their challenges what they 're moving toward what they 're moving away from so you can actually structure your key messaging so as we move through here you 'll see that google is really just a platform that we talk about generating visibility but really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being very specific and developing your key messaging on google so google will get you in front of a lot of people but it won 't convert that 's up to you with your messaging and how well you understand your target audience one thing i always say to people i say what business are you in and people will say i 'm in uh b to b or b to c and the reality is if you 're in marketing you 're in h and that 's human to human so you 're touching on the earlier slide you really need to understand people as much as you understand your product and you understand technology so let 's have a look i guess at the different platforms so the top image is is uh obviously people shopping and that would represent google and really on google the good thing about google is that people are in what i call a buyer 's mode or they 're in an interested or inquiry mode so they 're very very easy to to really capture their attention and drive them into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people are either searching for things whether it be information or something to buy so you 've got them in that mode when you look at social media social media is more of a difficult i guess or more challenging um marketing approach because you need to interrupt people and if you really look at those images and you really stood there and imagined you know trying to sell something to these people you could imagine the top people who are in buyers mode are quite easy it would be very difficult to go down and you know you 've got to interrupt those people that are doing their social activities in the social environment and obviously to with with linkedin say in a business networking so they 're your approaches really and google is answering questions so your content really needs to be designed around and this is a native strategy to content it really needs to be designed around answering questions what are people searching for and what are they looking for and what are they going to be compelled to engage in relating to your business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to use partly entertainment and and partly information so that 's a different strategy and more difficult but on the right hand side there you have engage connect convert so engagement strategies are different on different platforms um the connection strategy is similar and the conversion strategy which you 'll see at the end of this the last slide in this presentation the conversion strategy is usually the same and i 'll show you how all that comes together so how we can handle things today you can actually um you can put questions in the chat but we 're going to move through this pretty quickly because there 's a lot to get through um i 'm going to stay back and answer questions at the end so it 's always better i think if you sort of queue up your questions and we can go through those at the end i 've also everybody who is in this webinar today i 'm going to do a half an hour strategy session with and the reason why that 's important is because every business is different every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitors are in search it 's all different so really this is all about just i guess raising awareness of you know what you need to consider and what the considerations and the labor points and how you need to structure the way that you position yourself online and it 's generic because it covers every business and then what we can do is that half an hour session we can really break down and get specific about your business so if you can go to that link anytime through the presentation or at the end and you can just book straight into my calendar at a time that suits you and what that will do it will bring up a page like this and what you want to do is click on the the one on the right hand side here which is choose time that 's a strategy session there on the right okay so what i might do is i might just launch a poll just to sort of get an idea of where people are at so i can sort of structure the content there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no the pres the uh the webinar you can sorry the strategy session you can uh you can uh do it anytime so you can just do it at your convenience okay so let 's have a look here so this one here is really i mean how you use google um just trying to get an understanding of who 's claimed and verified their their google listing and how you use google do you actually use it just as an online directory or do you use it as a marketing platform in other words are you proactive in doing posts so you 're actually using it as a similar to how you use social media i guess in in the way that you 're actually posting content regularly and also too i just want to get an idea of if you 've got any issues as well so if some businesses have lost their login their passwords they can 't get into their listing some people have their listings marked permanently closed by mistake and that 's a very difficult thing to to fix but i can explain how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every business i talk to has a negative fake review so i 'm going to actually touch on that today but i just want to get an idea of who 's got lisa reviews on their listings that may be fake or maybe negative and the last question on there is do you have yeah okay do you have google my business app on your phone that is really important because as we move through this presentation you 'll find that being in real time with people is very important on google because that 's what people are expecting on google now so to be able to answer reviews answer questions answer messages directly from your um your google my business listing is really important and that 's why you want to have that on your phone okay great okay so why prioritize google i guess in many cases that 's an obvious question i mean google 's the largest search engine in the world and obviously people are on google actively looking for for businesses or information they 're actively trying to solve a problem on google but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting because this is the usual marketing approach when you 've got um you know when you 're approaching marketing you say 30 of people know they 're not interested 30 don 't think they 're interested and 30 not thinking about it 67 open to it percent buying now hang on jen uh she 's trying to get in she might not be uh jan she might not be using the password google to get in just let me know how you go with it i can get someone to look at that if you like okay so if we switch back to this diagram just let me know here go jam that this is the usual approach or the usual dynamic really in marketing it 's the marketing pyramid by chet holmes and really the one thing i love about google is everybody that 's searching for a business in google is interested so it 's not really 30 no they 're not interested 30 so they 're 60 to 90 percent um you 're ahead of the game straight away so i always say to people when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you weren 't interested in so people are interested in google and i always say too look i like social media i think social media absolutely has its place in terms of marketing but the thing about google is that people are actively looking they 're in a buyer 's mode you don 't have to interrupt them so google really for me i 'd rather be targeting one to two hundred people in google for two to three four five thousand people on social media because the conversion rates on 200 in google are far better than they are when you 're targeting a larger audience obviously there 's cost associated with getting to a larger audience as well so google is free if you use organic so for me google is hands down the okay i 'll get someone to look at that jan google for me is hands down the starting point everything should build upon google so it 's really understanding how you position your business in google so you get in front of the most amount of people that are searching so this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on i guess early in the piece is that most people you speak to they want to get to number one in google and that seems to be the you know the number one goal for people to get to number one and what i can say is that it 's not that easy because if you want to get to number one you can just do google ads and that will get you to number one but the problem is you need to really have a conversion strategies i touched on earlier um in the webinar is that you need to have a strategy to convert now this is a this example that i 've got here is a prime example of a business okay it 's one sec i 've just got to try and let somebody in here jen i can 't see her um coming in i 'm just wondering whether she 's uh whether or not she 's um clicking on the right link because there 's nothing coming up and she should just be able to put the password in and jump straight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to go back to the link and try the link again okay um okay so this business here this they 've taken an ad out and they 're number one basically in search when you 're looking for a local accountant so account near me the issue with this if you look over um over here this is their listing on google so that 's their primary image which is um it 's distracted here trying to uh let this person in i can 't see her jan i don 't know what uh what 's happening there um so basically this business here is spending money on google ads and this is the image that they 've got on their listing now another issue with this particular business and this is why a lot of businesses really failed with google ads is if you look at the um the business firstly they 've got their their listing up here they 're paid number one so as i said before doesn 't guarantee success if you click on their listing it 's garbage uh tins at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listing up so you 've got to think that when someone clicks on that ad the first thing they 're going to come across and see they 're going to look look at your business and do some research and also too when you click through to the website i 'm going to touch on this as we move through that their website loaded in 11 seconds and i 'll explain this as we move through that your website is very important the page that you 're sending people through to with a google ad must load fast because what they what they 'll be getting on statistics is a 70 bounce rate so firstly what this business has done they 've paid for ads they 've got a really bad image on google on the google listing and their website 's load speed is very very slow so 70 of people will actually leave that website before it loads so they 're only maximum gonna get 30 percent of their potential and this is a mistake that a lot of people make in their marketing what a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or they spend so much time developing content to engage to get in front of people but they really don 't have a strategy to take them beyond that as i touched on earlier it 's conversion which we 'll cover today so really anybody that runs google ads really should have a really really good looking professional google my business listing and they should also consider their load speed and i 'll explain this a bit later on i don 't like using web pages directly out of ads you 'll link your web page to your google listing but every ad or every promotion that i do whether it be social or whether it be um whether it be search i always go to a landing page because it loads really really quickly and it 's really minimizing that bounce rate there 's no point marketing and then cutting out 70 of your audience straight away so what most businesses do with google is they use google very similar the way they use the yellow pages so they 're using it as a directory so they really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly which is a problem but a lot of businesses that actually have their listing set up aren 't proactive they 're not really doing anything with their listings and they 're not using it as a platform to connect and to convert people on search they 're just waiting for people to connect with them and that 's very evident when you go through they haven 't got call to actions they haven 't got content that motivates people to take an immediate action and in search you 've only got a couple of seconds and as i mentioned earlier too that it 's a very crowded environment so you don 't want to just have a listing that sits there you 've got to have a listing that sets apart sets you apart from your competitors and it gets people to take immediate action so that 's why a lot of businesses in terms of organic will fail on google because they 're not really setting themselves apart from their competitors and the reason why it 's important there 's google 's insights for brands in 2020 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about a 30 or 40 page document and it gives you insights into you know what are the trends basically um of people in search and what are they how are they how are they behaving in search so these this is information when i mentioned earlier understanding people understanding behaviors are really important and this is quite a compelling number that 78 of people research before they purchase now even if you 're not using google even if you 're not using google as a lead generator so okay so you 're not doing google ads or you 're not really going out proactively trying to attract people on on google 's platform the consideration is that you may have your business that someone 's referred they 've referred a friend to your business they 've seen a sign they 've um they 've they 've seen a social ad they 've seen something that 's off search 78 of people will do their research online before they make a purchasing decision so you may have a great referral but as soon as they go for accountants near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approach because what that tells me when i look at a business like this what that tells me is that if they 're doing bookkeeping to me this doesn 't really demonstrate a business that has their eyes dotted and their t 's crossed they had they 're not a business that 's really looking at the detail particularly in bookkeeping you 'd expect them to be right under the details so for me this would turn me right off this business and as i said it doesn 't matter whether you 're lead generating through google people are going here to see whether or not you are a reputable business or whether you 're the right choice now the problem with google because it 's a search engine that if someone goes so you can imagine the dynamics so let 's say for instance i heard about elite bookkeeping someone said they 're really great for your business and i went did a google search and i saw this the issue is now i 've gone from a non-crowded environment so i 've gone from somewhere that um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend that 's told me about this business to now on google where there 's a whole lot of competitors so now i 'm in this cluttered environment i 've been turned off this business and now i 'm going to go to another business so really got to consider that it 's not just lead generating on the platform it 's your brand and reputation on the largest marketplace in the world basically so you really need to have a very very professional presence on google so as i mentioned earlier too that really google is a part of the puzzle and it 's really what you do off google that is going to be the difference between whether you 're successful or not now really in any marketing you need a plan and why it 's important for google is the plan needs to consider not just how you 're going to engage people on search it needs to consider what are the next steps so what are the next steps in that journey so when somebody connects with you then you go through the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building authority so you 're setting yourself apart from your competitors using content on the platform but then what are you going to do when you take them off the platform what is the next step once they see you in search and if you look at most people 's google listings they don 't have next steps they 're basically just saying here 's my business here 's my business this is who we are hopefully i 'm hope and pray that you 'll get in touch with us you really need to create urgency because on google people are on google searching and you 've got seconds two to three four seconds to get that person to engage so everything must be around call to actions lead magnets motivating giving them reasons to contact limited offers time sensitive action steps and that should be happening on your google platform so when we talk about plan engage and convert these are really the levers that we have available so if we look at um planning um and and again this is this is really around marketing and understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wrap a marketing strategy around it so really um i do a a marketing strategy webinar which which really focuses on the planning stage and what that is is really developing a customer avatar so really identifying who 's your target audience what are they looking for um what solves their problems um you know what are they moving away for away from and toward and really mapping out the customer journey so it 's knowing okay so today i 'm going to put a google listing on i 'm going to put some posts on my google listing and now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to drive them to a landing page and i 'm going to get them to register for something or buy something so you need to know all those steps rather than just sort of plonking all of your content on google and hoping for the best it has to be an end-to-end plan and i guess in marketing one of the most overused sayings is if you fail to plan you plan to fail so really it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of what you 're trying to achieve on google and then when you really understand what that conversion process is for the third process you will then really understand how that you you formulate your content on google so google really when it first started was really just a search engine it was very basic it was organic listings google my business came out in 2015 in australia launched in australia and that really gave businesses the capability um to start to market now google shouldn 't be treated like social media but it 's got integrated messaging it 's got posts and it has these levers within search you can actually start to put content up to actually get people into a sales funnel so that 's why really with google it 's very important that you still look at this as an overarching strategy with marketing okay so in terms of planning a lot of businesses that i actually sit and talk to i i recently spoke with a i 've done a lot of work with real estate agents and i spoke to a girl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on on social media too on a google listing and basically on her website why is she putting this content online and this is a very common um very common response that i get is i don 't know and really they 're putting content on because they feel that um and i guess really what 's what 's really caused it 's like anxiety really that people have to always be putting content on search to stay above the scroll and what happens there even on search or on google people are populating content for content 's sake and it can actually damage you and an example of that on um obviously here the content can actually be negative with the bins but all of your content really must be formulating to build brand build authority and trust educate solve a problem meet a need drive an action or pre-frame a conversion so if it doesn 't fit into those categories it shouldn 't really be posted there 's no need to post it so in social media if you start posting content particularly that is of low value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide your posts or hide your content from your followers that 's why engagement rates have dropped so really posting content that has no value is actually a negative negative for your business so you really need to start thinking about you know particularly on google a collage of content that really supports what you 're trying the message you 're trying to put forward and the authority that you 're trying to build and this is um i get i guess the journey of seconds um really this is building awareness and then what you 're going to do doing for engagement how you 're going to build trust what actions are you going to drive so what do you want that person to do once they see your content and be very aggressive about what those actions are you will really motivate and push and drive and give value for people to take that action immediately and what 's your conversion strategy are they going to register for a lead magnet so you can get their details to remarket and market to them or are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to get them to buy something so they 're really i guess a little bit off topic you could say of google in the sense of um you know how google should be structured and set up but they are considerations that you have to have whether whether you 're marketing on any platform so whether or not we 're sitting down developing marketing plans for businesses whether it be google we just put all of those in a platform list whether it be google whether it be direct email whether it be social media whether it be radio or whether it be tv whatever those platforms are they 're the engagement platforms we always have a plan we always then consider the platform but we always have a conversion strategy that runs off it and that is why if i look at businesses and any business comes to me and says you know they want to improve their conversions on google they haven 't got a conversion strategy so really people are quite lost at what to do next so let 's look at google so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really to build visibility and engagement on google there 's the google my business listing which we 're going to dive into in a minute um there 's organic search results so really where you come up on in organic search there 's google ads for shopping and google ads that come up in your google search results now the difference between the two strategies is with organic google dictates the terms so basically you have to you have to really match the beat of the drummer what google wants but with google ads and google shopping you can really dictate and target specific people so you dictate the terms of where you want to be placed and what your where you want your ad or where you want to be seen on organic you 're really up to meeting google 's ranking criteria and understanding what google values so google values your business and prioritizes you higher so if you 're going to run with an organic strategy you really need to understand what google is and really this may sound obvious but really when people approach um google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ google maps is run out of india it 's a different silo to google and google searches run out of the us so they 're too different they feed off each of the information but they 're two very different um different uh divisions of google now with google maps it 's about accuracy so if you think about it um google 's got a mapping platform and it 's competing with other mapping platforms the most important thing with a mapping platform is accuracy of information where businesses are so you don 't go down to the local rms which i did once by the way and it wasn 't there that moved so if that happens a lot to people they go to a business they 're closed they 're not there anymore google will start to lose its credibility in its mapping platform that will directly affect google ads word revenue so google is very very protective of making sure that it has its mapping information correct and the way it does that is it uses what we call citations um not a lot of businesses have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important things on google particularly with google maps so citations are your name address and phone number i 'll go through this in a moment when we go through the listings but you need to make sure that your name address and phone number is consistent on google also on your website and also too on all of the direct directories now one of the issues here is a lot of people haven 't heard if we go across to here these directories if i go down this list if you can see this um some of these directories you may never have heard of but if you look at this number here 195 94 93 92 that 's basically google 's ranking authority so what google says is i trust the information on this platform 100 95 94 93 so what you need to do and a key ranking factor for visibility particularly in google maps must be to get your name address and phone number consistent on these directories so consistency is not just um you know my old address and my new address it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be so if it 's 24 7 smith street unit b whatever that format has to be exactly the same so what i always suggest to businesses is to get a citation format and make sure that 's consistent on every one of the directories so just improving your citations if you run a citation report you would be shocked at how many directories you 're missing from where your information is incorrect and the issue you 've got is a lot of local directors scrape your information from all different sources so you 've got third-party directories out there that are just kind of putting your information together you 're not even aware of and google 's referencing that so what it turns around says well the the citation score for this business in other words this is how much i trust where this business is is around 12 13 so you want to get at that up over 80 to 100 so that 's very very important to google maps so most important thing with google maps is your citations and if we come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in show you here so organic ranking over here is where your business is going to come up down in here in this area here so obviously you 've got your google my business listing on the right here this is google shopping and down here is your organic results so to to feature highly in that area there are over 200 ranking factors and i 'm not going to go through those now but you 've got the the top ones listed next to the phone there and these are considerations that really tie back to your website so your website plays a very important role in your ranking in organic search so one of the things you can do i 'm going over to this example and what i can do is in the strategy session i can go through what we 'll do is we 'll do some testing on your website you can actually see where your um we can actually go through and pinpoint where your website may be letting you down in terms of your ranking authority on google but over here there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in organic search and if you look over here you 'll notice this these videos that show here uh there 's a business here press cronulla you can see how they 've got videos showing from youtube so it gives them a stronger presence here as well and other things you can do is create google loves local content so local content if you 've got a local business you may put some content on your website about a local fate or a local event that 's happening that helps to rank your your business higher in search so the things that you can do without getting i guess into the complexity of this this is really a web development aspect and how you set up your website now a lot of people talk about seo and how seo is really important on page seo should only have to be really done once on your website so if your website 's letting you down it 's because your web developer or whoever it 's been put together by hasn 't addressed the key issues on on on your website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website report pick up all of the issues and address those issues that 'll help you to be more visible in organic search also to the descriptions that you use here if you look here the descriptions that you 're using here are very important as well because this is what people are seeing for the first time when they see you in search so really your website will affect your visibility and conversion and that is really with speed compliance and structure and content one thing i do want to say is a lot of businesses use a facebook page as their website that is really not a good idea that will not help you in organic organic search google wants to know that you 're a legitimate business and that you you have a domain which is called domain authority so brandlocal.com is our domain so the domain authority is linked to not only having the domain but also to the age of the domain so if you ever say brandlocal.com for 20 years that has a higher domain authority so really to use a facebook page because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content you have to update it 's really going to hurt you in terms of your visibility in google so the best advice i can give you is to make sure that you have a website even if it 's very simple even if it 's like a landing page format but to have a website with a domain is really really important so we talk about this is really interesting i mentioned earlier about the bounce rate and if you look here in the seconds this is the speed that that this is this is how speed i guess affects bounce rate so if you 're down to say 15 seconds you 're losing 75 percent of people who are clicking through to your website uh five seconds is 38 percent three seconds is 12 so you start to really climb it around four seconds so if your website loads slower than say two to three seconds um then you 're really starting to really limit your potential audience so as i say it doesn 't matter how much work you do on google or how much work you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email marketing campaigns or anything for that matter if people have to wait on a mobile device or particularly where people are more impatient if they have to wait or it loads slow they will leave so a bounce rate is basically that they 've just left the page before it 's all loaded or without them taking action so it 's very important that you look at load speed on your website um i 'll show you there 's a couple of tools and what i 'll do don 't worry about writing them down i 'm happy to share this deck with you and also to the links but if we look over here um google has tools that allow you to check your your load speed so if we were to go in here and say blackwoods.com you can just put your domain name in here and this will start this will tell you exactly where your speed is at and this is critical this is really critical in terms of if you are taking someone and as i mentioned earlier it 's really important what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if people are bouncing and they 're not even getting the conversion page it 's a problem okay so we 've got 2.7 4.5 so it 's not too bad it 's not great either but there 's things like that on your website don 't have video on your home page on your first page it loads any all your content must be all your images must be actually crunched down so they 're not um you know uploading large 300 dpi images you must get that load speed down as fast as possible if you look here as well you 've got obviously desktop and mobile um you go over here too and look at things like mobile friendly in terms of um you know i won 't go through there it 'll probably a bit slow but it 'll go through and it 'll actually look to find what page errors are showing up on your website as well so all these tests and i 'll send you the links to these links these pages where you can run the test your website performance is critical if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're going to run paid ads and sit at the top and take them through the landing pages to convert that 's great but if you 're going organic and you want to show high in organic search and be highly visible your website is a massive consideration so i 'll send you the links and what i recommend is running tests and identifying where you 're not meeting compliance where you 've got errors and where your load speed is slow and just by fixing those things will make a big difference in terms of visibility okay the other thing that consideration too is hosting a lot of people really overlook this i 'm going to actually get a bit faster here because we 're running a little bit slow um hosting is really important if you go with shared which is a cheaper form of hosting it 's slower it 's less secure and if you go to dedicated cloud hosting it 's faster it 's more secure and it 's obviously premium it seats more money so you 're probably going to spend around about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of load speed when you consider how important load speed is um to converting so if you 're running all this paid marketing you could have someone running 100 150 worth of adwords a month or a week um yet they 're they 're hosting plans on thirty dollars versus sixty dollars and they 're turning around turning away seventy percent of their potential um conversions or potential target audience so if that cost of that extra cost of 30 or whatever it may be um is well worth it okay so google my business um just in terms of the setup with google my business i want to explain thing a lot of businesses i get get a bit stressed when you tell them you don 't own your listing and this is really important and if you 've got fake reviews or negative reviews you you 'll know firsthand that you don 't really have much control over your google listing so i could actually go up go to your business i could log on um go to google i could actually go to your listing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything i 've actually come across situations where competitors there was a company in bathurst and the competitor for a cafe took a whole bunch of photos of the local cemetery and put it on their competitors listing now that 's classified as local content and it is hard for google it 's hard to get google to remove content particularly if it 's local based content as well and it 's just not a very good look for the business so you 've just got to understand that managing your listing and keeping on your listing is really important but google my business listing is not there for your business and this is just shocks a few people but it 's there for for consumers it 's there for the general public so google creates these as an information platform that has opening hours reviews content for the end user not for the business so a lot of people get upset when they contact you and they say look i 've got a you know an image or a review i can 't get rid of it and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fake reviews so it 's just really important that you you manage your listing and make sure the content that 's put on your listing is representative of your business if people are adding content to your business listing and you 're not happy about it there 's only really one way try and get it removed but if it doesn 't make um or breach google 's policies or terms you can 't get rid of it and the way is to lose that content in producing a lot more content so your content dominates on your listing i 've had businesses that will actually invite customers to add content to their listing i think that is a terrible mistake i wouldn 't even encourage that reviews yes in a controlled environment but adding content it 's low quality images and it 's not necessarily how you want your business represented so i i wouldn 't recommend that i 'd be very protective as much as you can about the content that 's on your listing so in terms of we 'll just run through this quickly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite easy you 've just got to really run through the process in a one-on-one session that we do i can actually take you through any issues you had i did have an inquiry about how you run a an online business that 's purely online and that the answer to that question is that really an online business that doesn 't actually service customers in an area or through a physical location isn 't really permitted to have a google listing it 's not the types of businesses they want to have online there are ways around it and i will explain that in the um in the strategy session with the person that asked that question but um really setting up your listing is quite simple so if you haven 't got a listing what you would do is you go to google.com forward slash business okay so you 'd start here um and most people said that they actually had their listing set up now if you 're unsure if you have a listing what you want to do is you want to google your business name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't come up on the right-hand side so if you 've got um there 's a company i dealt with the other day okay this is the streaming guys i dealt with the other day and he said i 've got to google my business listing i said well it 's not showing for me but it was showing for him apparently i didn 't see it but if you google a business name up here and the business doesn 't come up on the right hand side chances are you haven 't got a google listing however disclaimer with that don 't take that for granted google your phone number your uh your address and google all the information about your business to see if something comes up variations of your name because the last thing you want to do is create another listing that has the same name address and phone number now you may not be able to find it first firstly but if you have duplicate listings what can happen is google will can can delete both listings permanently delete and the reason it does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deleted duplicate listings one because it doesn 't want duplicate listings but two people were creating multiple listings so if i had one business at say ride and i created multiple different listings with the same phone number people were doing that to try and get more visibility on google so what they can do is not only delete it they can actually block you and and basically uh it 's very difficult you 're listing back so you want to check that you haven 't got a listing before you create a listing and that 's not just a new listing that 's if you 're going to create another listing for your business to check every single location you have so there 's one listing per location so if we come up to uh to here you 'll see that once you 've actually got your listing set up you can see here that these are listings that i have that i manage when you go through here you can actually go in and start a new listing so you can actually set up a new listing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those together so let 's say see down here you 've got add a new business down into here so when you 're adding a new business you might be the same business but they 're really referring to a different location every business location is referred to as a business so the key really in this in google really is to complete all of the information here and it is pretty self-explanatory to actually set it all up so you really want to go through and make sure that on your home page um i 'll go through here this business doesn 't actually set those up properly if you look at this okay so obviously going through here and adding all of your information in here as i say is very self-explanatory um listing all the services that you you provide um so rather than go through all that now in each step by step if you have an issue or you 're not sure what what you should be putting into into a certain area or you 're not sure what how it works or if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy session but and i 'll actually go through and have a look at your google listing as well in terms of the back end you should be regularly looking at your insights on your listing as well this will go through and show you what activity is is happening on your listing so it gives you an idea of how people are actually behaving in search and how they 're actually accessing your listing it also tells you to how many actions that they 've done if you look here visits to the website request for directions through maps obviously calls i click on the call button and messages one thing you should always we should definitely set up is messages i 'll take you through have a look here the reason why this is important okay so if we go into so we 're going to this business here this is directly linking out a search okay see down here um never wants to work when you want it to work when you activate messages you can see down the bottom here this will activate this on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving people the ability to contact you directly um and it comes through so you 're chatting directly so that gives you an immediate connection and one of the most important things is to get people to be able to connect really really quickly through through google so messaging is really important for your business in terms of connections okay so obviously through photos down here is where you read your photos but also two videos is added up here as well now google 360 degree content is really important on your listing it 's a key ranking factor for google so you can see here this is the google 360 this links in directly from google maps so from a ranking factor in terms of being more visible on google maps is a google 360 degree virtual tour is important to add to your listing um obviously in video here as well video is a ranking factor as well so if you can put videos on here 30 second videos on your listing and it 's all done under the photos tab and that 's because it used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here but the thing is when you 're adding content to your listing you want to make sure that the content as i said before is all supporting a um you know the the authority that you 're trying to build the message you 're trying to build and it 's either informing or it 's engaging for your target audience down here in posts posts are really important you 'll see this business uses posts here now these posts can go directly to landing pages you can redeem offers now these sit in search to give you an idea how this looks it sits down here in here and if you go into google maps it sits in google maps with your post and sitting in here so what this does is really broadens your it broadens your your real estate i guess in search and maps and it gives more clickable engaging content sitting on your listing so you really should be running three to four posts for different things on your listing at any given time and then that 's proven to increase engagement through google um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute now these social icons down down uh here if you have um at the bottom of your listing this is a thing i get asked a lot you want to have your social profiles listed on the bottom here now you can 't add those into your google my business listing so you can 't just go this is my facebook profile this is my youtube profile it has to be actually picked up from your website so it 's the way you actually structure those profiles on your website to have them listed here so if you look at they 've got um facebook there if you look at say for instance down here you have your main profile sitting at the bottom so that 's how really how it 's structured you can also see through here that we have multiple posts running as well so really from a this is a chat bot that we 've got linked on here we 've always got this linked into to go directly into the webinar i 'm sorry google strategy so we 're linking off to various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion i 've got about five running about five or ten minutes over okay so conversion this is i kind of like this picture because i think that what a lot of people do and i mentioned this before is that they make it very difficult for people to engage with them so you 've got to simplify everything out of search and it 's like the old you know the lolly shops they put the lollies down in front of the kids they don 't have any obstacles or distractions in the way it 's an obvious choice it 's right in front of them and that 's how your marketing in terms of conversion has to be so really when i spoke and i 'll bring up the mobile um earlier i spoke about uh 78 or 72 of people are looking for immediate answers or they 're looking for immediate information out of um out of google so it 's really important you have the ability now everybody 's different so this is why i say run three or four different strategies so out of google you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listing okay so we 'll run an ad here obviously for the webinar so you can go directly through register for the webinar and the beauty of this is it 's actually coming directly out of search so you 're going from search clicking on a button you 're creating something that is appealing in terms of some content to click on and you 're actually taking them through to an action this one here i 'm going to show you through particularly on a mobile device is chat and i 'll touch on that in a sec in a second how that works if i go to brand local we actually have a chat bot which is a facebook messenger chatbot so it runs off the facebook platform um it links directly out of our um it links directly out of our our google profile so if i click on here this links directly into our chat bot so now that person 's clicked on that i actually have their top their their entire facebook profile and this runs them through an automated um you know messenger so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining me in messenger now there 's two optional buttons below the first one we 'll take you through to how we 're helping businesses so what this does is just gives me an immediate connection so i 'll in some cases use uh chat bots some cases i 'll use messenger straight out of google messenger in other cases i 'll use landing pages so you should always be running multiple strategies and this is the idea this is the beauty of posts and what you want to do is continually change these images because sometimes images work and other times images don 't and really i 've been in marketing for a long time and i 'll be honest sometimes you don 't know why they work and why they don 't sometimes the image or the promotion that you run you think it 's going to be great and it 's the worst one so you 've really got to start to really test and measure and this is a really good way of doing it through search and you can see here even if you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this is quite boring over here so this is giving me something for people to click on so you 're using images that that your target audience would be would motivate them or would create curiosity and use those in search and linking to to all different things so some people want chat some people want to go to a landing page some people want instant answers some people want a lot of information so you 've really got to cater for different people and have multiple strategies going at once and then you begin to learn what really works out of search okay so let 's talk about conversion so i i mentioned before that the awareness engagement trust and action and conversion that process is seconds so you really need to be really driving that next action and creating motivation i don 't use the reasons why i 've explained earlier with load speeds and issues with websites and also too the fact that you know you 're sending someone to a web page you should never ever run ever run a google ad campaign and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of marketing because you what you 're doing is you 're really if you 've got say two seconds you get two to three seconds to convert someone you you pay your website takes three to four seconds to load so some people may hang in there but then you expect them to get to your website and they 've got to put all the pieces together and they 're going to leave you will not never convert them in a million years so if your conversion rates are too uh sorry down at zero then that would probably be a reason if you 're sending people to your home page i always send people to a landing page loads faster i can put a a message that is purely to do with that particular offer so if the ad matches the landing page or matches the next step in the um where i 'm taking that person out to it must match it must be congruent with what they 've actually clicked on so don 't send people to a website when you 're running ads or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute ago because it 's instant and we 're in an instant world people want to ask a question when are you open um you know do you sell this can you cater if you 're a restaurant you cater for vegetarian vegan whatever people want those answers and if you don 't you 're not ready to answer those questions or available to answer those questions then people will move on so that 's why i said before is to have the google my business app on your phone so if someone asks a question or someone leaves a review you can reply to that review instantly so you must reply you must reply to every review negative or positive and i 'm going to touch on reviews the last thing uh chat bots obviously are very good too because chat bots where messenger is okay in google uh messenger chat bots through facebook messenger we develop full ai messenger chatbots that can really cater for almost any question asked we can use chat bots to log people into user accounts we can guide people to different products to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bot which really drives the customer conversion process directly out of search so chat bots are a real i guess a more advanced form of messaging and automation and one of the great things about chat bots and i can expand on this if you want to know more about chatbots when we chat is that chatbots are using they use ai and they 're also very good for automating remarketing so if someone as soon as someone connects with that bot they go into our funnel and the actual chat bot manages all of the connection points hey haven 't heard from me for a while and continues that conversation going to really build and push people through a funnel so chatbots are really the way of the future in terms of marketing but having those things linking directly out as a as a an option straight at a search is gold and obviously too obviously you 're trying to drive a phone call or a visit in store or at your premises but really the the four icons the left are all about you know getting engagement directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be structured in this format uh to be this is a proven format that that works and it 's addressing the majority um of your dialogue is addressing the problem that people have and this is why i mentioned before even though you 're using google as a platform so using google as a platform to actually connect with people you need to know that next step and that 's why you 're identifying right here at the beginning when you do your avatars or your customer problems objections moving away goals moving toward goals you 're understanding how to formulate that conversion so on the conversion page if you don 't highlight the problem or address the problem then you 're not going to engage people so you need to really show them that you understand the problem you need to talk about how your product can solve that problem you need to talk about a promise that this is what it 's going to do and it 's a guarantee of doing this and it 's been done before proof is obviously in reviews and case studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order when you talk about a lot of focus on the problem a lot of focus a lesser focus on the product promise proof and process so managing all these different buttons here um this is an alarming thing for me because i couldn 't imagine marketing if someone said to me i can 't use call to actions and lead magnets to actually get people to do things like limited offer um you know get this free free you know ebook or whatever your lead magnet is if i didn 't have that as leaders at my disposal i would would there be no way in the world you succeed in marketing people have to get something instantly they 've got to be able to download for a no risk trial you 've got to actually use these ways of people connecting with you and 72 of businesses according to small business trends don 't have call to actions on their website so this is the problem that when people go to the website they don 't know what to do so what you 've done is you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to convert so it doesn 't matter how successful you are in google or how many people see you in google if you don 't get this off off search process sorted out and and have those call to actions and lead magnets and you 've got to try multiple different ones and that 's another reason why every ad i run and every post i do links to a different landing page it 's all a b split testing i 'm testing every single part of the process i 'm testing how many views i get on search how many people go out of search what my bounce rates are what my load speeds are where i 'm heat mapping pages to find out where people are going and i 'm testing multiple different offers so when i talk about doing offers this is a very generic lead magnet or call to action and the reason i 'm i 'm using this as an example is because people think that a call to action is just a form and a button but really what you want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that you 're um you 're testing the headings so these headings will change and you 'll notice what i 've done in here is you won 't learn these strategies anywhere else so i 'm actually making people understand you this is the only place you 're going to get this no one else is doing this and then under there i 've got instantly received so i 'm meeting that need of people wanting things instantly and then down here i 'm using as less information on on my form as possible obviously they need an email to email the ebook he wants a phone number because he wants to actually call them to be able to convert them into a customer name you don 't want to put too many fields in here because it 'll lower your conversion rates but i covered this in absolute detail on the marketing strategy webinar which i 'm happy to send you an invite to but this is really what you want to start playing around with and it 's not just wording it 's not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your website or on your landing page so you need to have these sorts of things and if you want to know lead magnets you can use for your business i 'm happy to discuss those two when you have that um that strategy session now the last thing here and then i 'm going to get on to reviews now the last thing here if you look at the way i 've done this and i spoke about conversion strategy is it doesn 't matter what platform i 'm coming off what the real engine room for me is what 's happening in this middle section here so these are my lead magnets my landing pages and lead magnets i 'm testing all different lead magnets and i 'm using google posts to push through to these lead magnets without these lead magnets and conversion tools you 're not going to succeed so i could sit here and tell you how to get the number one in google or how to be seen by more people but it means nothing i mean it 's important but it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so you can see in google we 're pushing straight to google messenger we 're also pushing to the website on the main listing social does the same now i 'm running posts on google and similar themed ads on social i use a slightly different native strategy because i 'm having to interrupt on social so the ads are a little bit more entertainment a little bit more kind of social environment skewed whereas these posts here are more informative more information answering questions approach but they lead into here and these these pages speak uh or congruent with these ads that 's why they 're going to separate pages believe me if you don 't run this strategy you 're really kicking uh stones down the road it does not work and we 've run up to for one business i 've run up to 20 or 30 of these at any given time just to test what 's actually converting the best you 'll see here i 'll post always go through a chat bot and as i mentioned before the chat bot actually automates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i don 't have to get involved but what 's actually happening is this is what you want to design here and it doesn 't matter what platform you push to so there 's strategies to get more visible and more engaging on social the strategies get more visible and engaging on google but conversion happens down in here okay let me talk about reviews now reviews very quickly is are really important and the most important thing about reviews is that you respond to every review if you get a negative review it 's a legitimate review and negative how you respond will help you build your brand never ever argue never ever disagree always be understanding it 's yours i guess telstra worker mentality or the air hostess i 've heard this saying before is they they understand everything that really can 't help with anything they 're not argumentative so at the end of the day you want to use that as an opportunity um to to respond where where it builds your integrity in your brand because people read those people love reading through those sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a um with a a response that is um that is uh aggressive or it 's confronting that it only inspires them to do more in there so it actually not would look for your business but respond to every review it is a ranking factor ranking criteria for google um if you have negative fake reviews now that 's not a review that is legitimately an unhappy customer if it 's a fake review and the way you can test if it 's a fake review that when you go through into a review here what you do is you click on the person 's name in the review and you can see how many reviews this person 's left this person 's left one review if that was a fake review and there was no photo there i 'd start to ask a few questions if someone 's left 20 reviews and they 've left a negative one on your review chances are it 's not a negative fake review it 's a negative review it 's not a fake review now say you understand with how things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are if you go through and you have any doubt whether it 's a fake review you can go through your google my business listing and you can request google to review that review i want a better word and what google do they have tools they can tell whether someone set up an account and it 's never had any gmail activity it hasn 't done anything hasn 't logged into anything there 's no activity online except that one review it 'll be deemed a fake review and by the the law in australia with asic is that google must delete it so if it 's deemed deemed a fake review or a fake account that has made that review google wipe delete the account and that takes out the review so it costs you nothing to go through um and check that with google but if they 've got multiple i can say if they 've got multiple listing reviews and some are positive some are negative your chances of getting it removed are not good your only option is to be very measured in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offline so they 're not communicating online reviews are really important because reviews really sway social proof and i don 't know about you but reviews in terms of google reviews for me are really important an interesting thing about reviews is getting five-star reviews everyone wants to get five-star reviews it actually looks better and it 's a better ranking position if you have some reviews at four and a half or four stars and your review overall review is less than five google deems it pretty unbelievable that everyone 's got five star reviews so don 't worry if you get a you know a lesser review and it drops your score what i want to show you too in here with reviews because review is super important if i come into here just a bit of a tip um the other thing too with reviews just be very careful because you 're not allowed to actually sell the set reviews you 're not um you 're not allowed to say if you do a review i 'll give you a discount something it can actually have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i go to there 's a link in your google listing um and if i go to reviews okay so if i go to look here okay see down here on your this is on your home page on your google listing every business should use this and it should be should be on your email footer it should be on everywhere if you 're happy with their business leave us a positive review or leave us a review so if you click on here this will actually give your linking um your review url so if you cut and paste that and put it as a link in your email or if you 've done business with someone and you want to send them directly there this is the link now if you want to get reviews i 've done a lot of reviews for businesses and help them to sort of structure to get reviews to build social proof and what you want to do is if you send off an email and say can you send give me a review your chances of getting the review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building quality reviews what i always suggest is that what you do is you contact the customer you ask them a few questions about your service you write the review in a very very simple format which is reflective of what they 've said so you can ask sort of i guess loaded questions and then what you do is you send them an email with the review and with that link and you say look if you 're happy with this i think i think i 've got what you said down pat if you 're happy that be happy to edit it if you want and just click that review and you can post it your chances of getting that review posted skyrocket because you 've done the work for them and only that too you 've taken the time to go through that process so they 're more likely to reciprocate and put that that review up for you so that really concludes going um basically the webinar but as i said this may raise a lot of questions and i no doubt it will and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for every business to go through and what we do is we 'll cover the um we 'll cover the um the we 'll run some speed tests we 'll run some compliance tests on your website we 'll check the health i guess of your website and and point out what you need to fix look we can discuss lead magnet strategies and conversion strategies and call to actions and how you can use those if you have any issues that are relating to your listing that you need specifically to address you can write those down and cover those off so that half an hour session which you can book uh you need to book it today though um just in terms of cover off my my calendar but if you book that session that is really part of this webinar so this is really just a an overview of all the considerations that you need to to to look at when you 're marketing on google but i 've also deliberately prioritized that it 's not just google that you can do everything so well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on google like this um this accountant and still fail so it 's really positioning yourself on google takes them to the step to the next page but it 's what happens off listing that is really going to determine whether you convert did anyone want to ask some questions that i might be able to answer just to wrap things up you do get copies of the slides hope um what i 'll do is i 'll send out a copy of the slides i will send out some links to the actual speed test so you can actually do your own tests with the links so yeah you don 't have to worry about um you don 't have to worry about really taking notes or taking pictures or screenshots i 'm just going to scroll through some of these questions here okay so um okay this question here i 'm i 'm not a shop front i work from home so i don 't want to list my home address after safety issues i use a pa box and google maps which makes sense i said yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your setup on your on your listing um jean if you want me to show you how to do that we can actually go through um if you 've got your logins for your google listing um and if anybody um i 'll just show you this too if you 're booking for this um for this uh session one thing i 'd suggest you do beforehand um is make me a a manager of your just temporarily of your you can boot me out just so i can actually have a review of your listing before um before um let me show you how to do that so if you go to your google listing and log in because what i 'll do is i 'll do a review of your listing for you over here on the right on the left hand side you 've got users if you go to users you can actually go in here and then just add a manager in here for um i can 't do that because i 'm not the owner of this account but if i was the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add grant at brandlocal.com and and i can actually review that before we go in now you can just go that through the exact same process and boot me out so it 's not and i can 't go in and do any anything uh to it so it just allowed me to go through and sort of highlight i guess what you need to address and jen i can actually look at yours before um the listing and i can actually show you how to to hide your address what 's a front-facing chat bot what goes into building a chat bot and what are the steps there 's a lot of chatbot building tools um there 's two steps really with chat bots that you need to consider is two is up one is architecture and two is technical uh the technical um ability to be able to create it um there 's a chatbot platform it 's quite easy to use called manychat many manychat and that will actually link into facebook messenger but you can actually use it to plug it into anything anything where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media you can actually have links in your social media link through to the chatbot so that 's the manychat 's a great platform to do it um if you 've got some technical skills you 'll you 'll be fine but there 's a lot of tutorial style videos as well related to chatbots but with chat bots the real like anything i guess is learning facebook learning youtube learning chat bots learning landing pages technically the skills you can go on youtube and you can learn the skills if you 've got the time but so it 's understanding really the the marketing approach how to layer that actual um the messaging one of the suggestions i might i always make is keep it very simple to start with and then build on what works the chat bots are definitely the way of the future in terms of automation so for me as a marketer a lot of the larger companies that we deal with we 're building um you know if you log on if you 've used chat through telstra or optus and things like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front-facing it 's really business to customer and the beauty of a chat bot is not only does it get the initial uh connection so if i see a chat bot i 'm more likely to click on it because i can get an instant answer um and it 's like messaging so people are used to doing that on their phones it gets their information downloads it straight away so you 've got it for marketing purposes and then most importantly too it 'll actually manage the remarketing so the chatbot will actually bring that that lead in but it 'll also manage that lead through a sales funnel so you can create that it gets quite technical but for a small business you can use it just simply to engage with the customer and to answer key questions what are your opening hours you know or product questions good thing about a chat bot is it doesn 't have to be totally automated either so what it can do is if the chat bot goes i can 't answer that question um and i might even do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect them with a human so if i 've got a chat bot and 80 percent of customer inquiries are handled through the chatbot but 20 go through to the keeper into sales when that 's a success so they 're good for automation um yeah umira just mentioning too with the home address i can help you with the home address issue um it might be something you haven 't set up quite correctly with that if it 's showing up on google maps no it doesn 't it doesn 't having uh if you don 't have a listing showing on google google what google wants is google wants to know your legit business you have a name address and you have a phone number and that is unique to a listing so you 've got to make sure that you don 't duplicate do not duplicate your name address and phone number on your listings don 't have the same phone number on those listings because it can be actually flagged as a duplicate account um so what i would uh what i 'll do i don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll switch over here okay we 've lost the camera okay interesting so what we 've um basically what we 've um what we 've um uh yeah so if you 've got a um if you 've got a home address that 's listed with google as a home address yeah so essentially okay i think our camera 's gone down can everyone hear me okay if i just switch off that camera all google wants to know is it 's a legitimate business it has um that it 's not an online business or it 's not a fake business um so essentially what google wants is google wants to to just basically confirm your legitimate it doesn 't matter whether it shows um on on the public uh in the public forum or the public space that 's not a problem let 's go through these questions there 's a lot of questions around local businesses hiding address that 's easy to do but you can imagine with um with google you know really these sessions and some the google strategies that i do is a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything out that you need to do but i think that really the most important thing and takeaways from this particular webinar is that it 's not all about google google is an important platform but it 's not all about google if you make it all about google you won 't succeed google is only a feeder of leads into a funnel and i think that businesses that just focus on being number one it 's okay to chase rainbows i always say but you 've got to know what you 're going to do when you get there so the whole idea is conversion and i 'll help you with that as um as much as i can if you sign up for that strategy session so is there any other questions i do apologize because that for some reason that camera 's um decided to go down all right well if you 're interested in doing the strategy session just be sure to um to go to that link and you can choose a time that 's convenient for you and what i 'll do is i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can move through things pretty quickly and um if you want me to go and have a look at your google listing by all means you can just put me as a manager 24 hours before and we can change that back afterwards well thank you everyone for for attending i hope that was um was informative um if you 'd like to leave a google review on brandlocal.com that would be all brand local i should say that 'd be great um and i hope that you do uh do register that strategy session only because it 'll actually start to put the pieces together in a very practical sense for your business so thanks again and i 'm very apologetic that we run over but um there 's a lot to get through you"

rain that we 've had not so good for the beach but absolutely fantastic for the garden and particularly the vegetable garden um i think it 's probably going to be the best year that we 've had for for quite a number of years so if you haven 't started get out there soon um so pretty much all of the all of the fruiting plants eggplants tomatoes etc this is their time so make sure you get those in quickly and for those who 've already got their garden going think about succession planting so things like lettuces only last for a few weeks um so you have to keep so don 't wait until the last lot 's finished start planting the next lot as soon as you you know as soon as the other one 's sort of nearly there for picking plant the next lot and then you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is your time and we have probably got the most extensive collection of chilies and we like them hot so do come and join us and we 'll find the right chili for your palate and with all of this rain [Music] never been a better time to plant a plant a uh a fruit tree so um the ground is moist and the outlook from the the bureau of meteorology for the next three months is for fairly moist conditions which is going to be a fantastic start for a young tree so we 've got a lovely range of citrus olives and many many other fruit trees so come in and we 'll find the right one for the spot in your garden

winners of our final category please sit back and enjoy a video on what special garden plants are available at eden gardens what a fantastic time of year plenty of colour in the garden but sometimes in those shady corners you can struggle a little bit for colour but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants brilliant colors and actually very easy to look after you know they are plants that actually collect their own water at the top of the plant through a little cup and so they really don 't need a lot of soil or or a lot of care they most of them don 't like to be hit by the sun so they 're fantastic for shady spots and you want to avoid getting them hit by the sun but brilliant plants to have a great asset for your garden so come in and get a bromeliad and and for a ground cover in summer shade you can 't beat the hostas there you know they 've got fantastic variegation in the leaves and these cute little flowers [Music] and my favorite special plant for particularly for vertical gardens the artist palette are the huckers there 's you know such a range of of colors and such contrasts they can really make any dim wall absolutely beautiful by these incredibly vibrant colors so coming outside the flowering plants are the stars of the shows amongst them the salvias are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden they can cope with droughts they love the heat and they can cope with humidity so perfect for for a sydney garden and there 's such a such a range of colors and they 're a fantastic perennial you do cut them back in winter but they come back every year and some really great selections and talking about color remember that there 's instant color can come from the from the potted color plants and they 're they 're so cheap and and very easy to brighten up your garden today when you 're at eden make sure you come and enjoy our fantastic display gardens with these beautiful trees the jacaranda and the illawarra flametree and so much more beyond [Music] your final awards for the ceremony are for the large garden category third place goes to philip shaw [Music] second place leslie and peter bertel [Music] first place goes to kathy schofield kathy has bravely converted an underutilized swimming pool into a wonderful feature complete with native fish and plants the plant selection and maintenance were excellent and she is a well-deserved winner [Music] that concludes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you check out the city of rides website for more information on this year 's competition including photos from tonight 's awards ceremony i would also like to

start let 's all right jan i 'll i 'll let you kick it off okay well hi everyone welcome to this webinar with the ato starting a small business being presented from the city of ryde we 've worked really hard during small business month to hopefully have a lot of information education and some inspiration to offer you all and help you along this difficult time and starting a small business is definitely a very big journey and we 're here to support you all we can for our local businesses here at the city of rides so i 'm jan bohari the economic development coordinator here and i work closely with our business community and i 'm so excited that we have lyndon regina presenting to you today from ato you 're going to get so much the australian taxation office you 're going to get so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they arise for you or she may choose to ask you to put your questions in the chat and she 'll respond after the presentation but without further ado i welcome lyndon thank you lyndon thanks jan oh i 've got a clap that 's fantastic um thanks jan and thanks karen and look the the ride city council do an absolutely fantastic job they hit the ground running their level of support is just phenomenal so if you need anything just reach out to the ride city council because they 're there to be able to assist guide and support you through not only covert but your small business journey so today 's session is starting a small business so firstly i 'd like to respectfully acknowledge the traditional owners and custodians of country throughout australia and their continuing connection to land waters and the community look i 'd like to pay my respects to them their cultures elders past and present now look throughout today 's session there 's a couple just a couple little housekeeping bits so we just asked that you stay on mute um and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your webcam off unless you want to go viral all over the world because the whole world knows about ryden city council and all the exciting things that they 're up to so that 's the first thing the second thing is i can 't give you specific advice in this type of forum however i certainly can give you general advice now one thing that usually happens during these types of forums is that we come to them we listen to them we engage with them but we forget to ask our questions and that 's that 's nature that 's normal so look what i 'm going to do is to put my email address into the chat box now so don 't hesitate record that email address take it down and if you walk away from today and you think oh i 'd just really like to ask a question you know what i 've just given you the front door key to the australian taxation office so come on down via that email address and i 'll be more than happy to get your questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run through quite a bit of information but um foremostly i 'd like you to feel comfortable to be able to ask your questions no question is a silly question you know why i can say that you know what i can afford to say that is because i 've asked them all i 'm i 'm not one to be backwards and coming forwards i 'll always put my hand up and i 'll always ask the question because at the end of the day you you know you want to walk away from this session feeling really with information because information and confidence is what 's going to get your small business off the ground all right so look today we 're going to talk business versus hobby what 's the difference i 'll get you across that don 't you worry we 're going to talk business structures and registrations and i will take your questions all the way through the session i usually keep one eye on the chat box and one eye on the presentation so today we 're going to chat about do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the difference i 'm going to draw a nice clean line in the sand between business and hobby we 're going to talk about registering for an australian business number which is an abn number we 'll talk about what business structures there are and we 're also going to talk about business registrations what do you need to be in business and trust me i have run into so many um people who literally wake up one day and they go yeah i 'm going to start a business so they 're going to register for an abn they register for gst they register for pay as you go withholding they 're registered for in you know sort of four months time they start getting activity statements in the mail and then they think oh i don 't know what that is and they just they throw and then the ato sends a letter saying why haven 't you lodged and then we might call you and say well why haven 't you lodged you might be up for a um a penalty for not lodging and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i woke up one day and i kind of thought i 'd register for everything but i never did anything with it well the ato doesn 't know that so this is why it 's really important that you 're attending right here right now to learn what you need to do because the key to small business and starting a small business is starting small step by step you know gain that comfortability around what your small business is all about my biggest saying and call it a country saying because i 'm back from wa but don 't get too big too quick okay that 's the key little baby steps one in front of the other then once you get to the fir end of your first year in business you 're able to look back at your business and you need to be able to look back in business to be able to forecast forward in business all right so look let 's look at an example this teddy eddie loves to bushwalk so eddie is often seen around korringa he 's often seen up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five trails and he just does it just as he likes to do it he 's not committed at all so it 's basically just between his family and his friends so eddie occasionally goes out on a saturday morning he might go out on a sunday afternoon look it all depends on weather and you know those sort of circumstances surrounding what he feels like doing um so you know he he sort of takes two and three people out here and there doesn 't expect to get paid sometimes some people want to pay him but i 'll talk to you more about that in a minute so because um he doesn 't have any intention to make a profit um it 's sounding like he 's still got a hobby plus he 's got a full-time youth working job so he works monday to friday as a youth worker so this literally just is a beautiful hobby that he loves doing sometimes does on a saturday sometimes does it on a sunday some weekends doesn 't do it at all because it absolutely pours cats and dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a one-man band it 's just him his back his backpack and his boots he doesn 't have a business plan and we 'll talk more about business plans in a minute and his hobby well it 's not really conducted as a business so look remember when i was saying some businesses like to pay try and pay eddie a little bit of money um so when businesses do voluntarily pay eddie for his services they may request an australian business now a business does this because when they pay for a service they can in turn claim a tax deduction so if they don 't quote or if eddie doesn 't quote an australian business number the person paying him can actually withhold 47 of that payment for tax purposes so that actually means that eddie doesn 't get 47 of his payment however in eddie 's situation he doesn 't have a need for an australian business number because he 's not running a business he still wants to get paid of all of what 's being offered but he wants to try and do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gives them and he gives obviously this to the business that 's going to pay him and by filling out this form it means the business he 's supplying doesn 't have to withhold any amount of money from his payment eddie gets the full payment so eddie gets the full payment the person paying him may get a deduction for paying him it 's a win-win situation so eddie actually fills out this box and this box so have a think about that if you 're still a hobby all right so it 's 12 months down the track word of mouth has spread eddie 's family of friends are starting to promote eddie 's business and eddie 's seriously sitting here like hundreds and thousands of other businesses around australia and he 's thinking well hang on maybe i just could turn my hobby into a business so eddie thought what can i do how can i do this so firstly he sought some professional advice he went to ryan city council and and said look guys i really need a bit of help and you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and said you know what we can give you um all these different places that you can reach out for a little bit of help and so this is what got eddie started so if it wasn 't for ride city council eddie would have never haven 't embarked on thinking of changing a hobby into it into his small business so through the advice that he received from um right city council 's associates eddie started up a website and he thought yeah that 's all right i put the registration link on there and he started to get a lot of people registering for his bush walks eddie then started to think you know what it 's all very well you know him being fit and and you know used to bushwalking what about those people that have never been into the bush what about those people who um you know may have um some incapacity to do these types of walks but still want to kind of have a try um what about those people that just didn 't see that tree roots just sticking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that really like to push life to the limit and they go to the edge of that cliff face what happens if someone got hurt in eddie 's business so eddie decided to invest in some business liability insurance for the just in case eddie also thought you know what i 'd like to cut down on my carbon footprint and the way that he can do this is by buying a van so instead of 10 cars driving up to the one walking trail eddie now goes and meets them at a central point takes them to the walking trail so eddie 's intentions have changed he 's paid out money for the insurance liability he 's bought a van and now he 's got a website for peter people to be able to register register through and he 's also ramped up his marketing on on facebook because you know as well i 'm not telling you anything but you know you can get those free facebook pages um that you can um sell your business on so eddie 12 months down yeah i want to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because eddie um he now is a youth worker monday and tuesday so he 's cut down from full-time to part-time and he 's actually um um started doing his bush walking wednesday thursday friday saturday and sunday yeah bless eddie he loves to work so his activities now regular his size and he 's got himself a new facebook page with a bit of brand marketing um he 's got himself a van so he can actually um you know drive his bush walkers to the trails instead of 10 vehicles going out to the same trail um eddie still doesn 't have a business plan um and eddie 's um business is being conducted as a business now let me just go back to that business plan okay when you start a small business when you start any sort of business the business plan is like the bible to your business and as i was saying to you before it 's all about that comfortability level so there 's lots of business templates big business plan templates on the net but the aim of the game is firstly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city council because they 've got plenty of avenues to be able to assist you with but secondly when you 're on google and you 're checking out a business template a business plan template find something that 's simple find something that you understand and the reason why i say that is because this is your business find out how you want to run it and a business plan is going to give you that lovely ability to have an overarching view of what 's happening in your business so you can actually record what income has come into your business and what expenses have gone out of your business now without if you don 't do that you 're not going to be able to have the vision of how you can grow your business so let 's look at i always use this the kayaking business you 're probably going to guess where i 'm broadcasting from very shortly but if i was to start up for a kayaking business in july now i know july will it 's cold so july and august pretty chilly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy mountains i tell you yeah i 've done it and it 's cold so if if july and august was slow a because i 've just started my business and b because it 's cold i need to work out how can i get my word of mouth out how can i spread the cheer of my kayaking business um so we get into september october traditionally really good months because they 're school holidays and the parents want to get the kids off the gamers and get them outdoors november look if the borders were open november 's beautiful weather in sydney december january fabulous months we 've got school holidays boom love that february the weather 's still gorgeous here and it 's usually quite humid so people want to be on the water march and april you usually have easter fall between the 26th of march and the 14th of april plus you 've got school holidays may traditionally quite lovely weather up until about the 20th of may after the 20th of may into june she 's starting to cool down so now i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i made my money where haven 't i made money where can i make where can i how can i turn not making money into my so this is where i can go to places like um right city council to ask i can ask you know who can you suggest that i speak to in relation to starting my small business sorry excuse me so eddie 's eddie 's now decided yeah you know what a business plan is a great idea because without a business plan i can 't look back to be able to forecast forward i can 't grow my business i can 't work smarter i don 't want to work harder i want to work smarter so business.gov dot a u has got a fantastic business template the choice is completely yours that 's just a mere suggestion but the aim of the game is with a business plan keep it simple okay don 't get too big too quick follow your steps find that lovely level of comfortability all right so if you 're in the creators or you perhaps you 're an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists in in the right city council um precinct you may want to go to business.gov dot a u fill this out answer it to the best of your ability it 's going to tell you if you 're if you 've actually still running a hobby or perhaps you should get into business so this is where we draw that lovely clear line in the sand between running a small business and having a hobby firstly you 've made the decision to start your small business you 've gone to the australian business register website you may know it as abr so you 've gone there and you 've registered for an australian business number you intend to make a profit oh yeah i plan to be the next bill gates of the nepean river in my kayaking business let me tell you um the size and scale has increased dramatically so eddie 's got a website he 's got insurance liability and he 's also got a van to be able to um transport all of his walkers to the trails um his size and scaling look it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry as his so how do you do that let me place something into the chat box it 's called benchmarks so benchmarks is a fabulous place to go to if you want to gain an idea before you know perhaps changing your hobby and starting a small business or just before starting a small business go to benchmarks it 's going to give you an overarching view of what you can expect to spend to be able to open up that sort of business and what you can expect to earn on average okay so the average spend and the average earn now this is going to tell you if you 've got enough money to be able to start your small business also it 's a great comparison tool the track go back to your benchmarks on ato.gov dot a u so that 's all you 've got to do go to ato.gov.edu type in benchmarks into the search function and uh and the industries will come up you 'll be able to see it just follow your nose so go back to the benchmarks 12 months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you not earning enough maybe you 're earning lots and you 're not spending much that 's always a good thing but this will give you an idea in relation to how you 're faring with your business now if i was to place my auditor 's hat on because i sat in auditing for a number of years within the australian taxation office this is like our bible this is the auditor 's bible and the reason why i say that is because a lot of income tax returns come across our desks and their expenses are higher and their incomes lower the reason why everyone 's going to declare their expenses that 's a natural thing to do but are everyone going to declare their income that 's the question so this is where i have the conversations with people that i 've audited and i 've said do you know about benchmarks and this is why your income tax return was picked up because your expenses are higher than your income give you a quick example with that my mate bob owns a chinese restaurant i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bob um spent fifty thousand dollars on rice for that financial year but bob only declared that he earned twenty three thousand dollars in his tax return so i said to bob bob how can you spend fifty thousand dollars if you 've only earned twenty three thousand dollars how does that happen teach me i 'd love to know so then i go and do a little bit more digging and i can see that bob 's got three children at private schooling bob 's been in and out of the country a number of times throughout the year bob 's um got a few flash cars and a couple of yachts sitting outside the front of his mansion so that 's when i say to bob hey bob your spouse doesn 't work we know your three kids are under 18. where 's the money coming from so benchmarks is a really really handy tool just to keep you on the on the on the level okay to keep you keep you focused give you a bit of hunger to be able to strive towards the average income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you can cut down your expenses as well okay so let 's talk structures there 's only types of structures okay so there 's sole trader there 's partnership there 's company and there 's a trust and it doesn 't matter which one you start off with but just a little bit of humble advice start small you want low cost and you want low complexity okay so as you can see the scale grows it means the cost to register for each of these entity increases the amount of paperwork that you need to lodge to be able to meet your taxation and superannuation obligations is more and obviously you know all your supplier needs your client needs so have a think before you get into small business what 's going to best suit you and just say you did start with a company okay and then 12 months down the track you think uh you know what it 's not quite for me maybe you might go back to being a sole trader because the simplicity of it suits you and then from there you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you met the love of your life you might want to stop being a sole trader and head into a partnership you can go any way you want to go okay the the options are completely up to you so the types of business registrations you need oops you need to register for an abn number you 're going to need a tax file number for your small business you may need an australian company number if you 've got a company if you change the structure of your name so for example if i was to call it lyndon regina 's kayaking i haven 't changed the structure of my name but if i was to call it lyndon 's awesome kayaking adventures i 've changed the structure of my name so i need to register for a business name if you earn over 75 000 for the year you 're gonna need to register for gst okay so from from one dollar up to 74 999.99 anything past that you must register for gst two things if you 're ride sourcing so if you 're a taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register for gst immediately you don 't have a choice with that alternatively let 's flip the coin if you are starting your small business and you need to buy a lot of equipment for your small business does that equipment have gst on it because if it does can you claim back that gst and you can do that by voluntarily registering for gst and claiming the gst credits because you 're going to be using that equipment for your business and then once you 've bought all of your equipment you may choose to deregister from gst i 'll just plant that seed and leave that one with you if you 're an employer if you 're going to employ people you may need to or you will need to register for pay as you go withholding and if you 're a company you may be providing fringe benefit tax allowances so that 's something else to look at depending on what type of business you want to get into perhaps it 's food catering so if that 's the case you may need some local council permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you say look i 'm planning to open up this type of business what do i need how can you help me and i 'll tell you something the tremendous team at ride city council they 're going to help you with this so feel supported the whole way let 's look at some examples so maggie 's um maggie 's real name is margaret smith and maggie 's a mechanic and she decided to open up a mechanic business so she 's got two employees and she plans to make more than 95 000 for the year so because maggie changed the legal structure of her name um she 's needed to register for a business name she 's also needed to register for an abn number okay an australian business number and you can go to the abr site to be able to register for an australian business number maggie 's going to use her own tax file number because she 's a sole trader sole traders use their own tax file number you don 't need to apply for another one because maggie 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to register for gst now let 's talk pay as so maggie 's smart maggie doesn 't want a tax bill at the end of the year now let me just stop there 60 of small businesses fail in the first three years usually because of two things the first thing bad record keeping can 't see what 's coming into the business can 't see what 's going out of the business what does that mean can 't see how much i 'm earning and how much i 'm spending so um the other second thing is debt and this is where pay-as-you-go installments come into it so traditionally a small business you know you 've got the intentions to do the away your taxes for all the dollars that you 're earning but sometimes business and life gets in the way and as i say we have good intentions but come tax time we go and lodge our tax return and boom we 've got a big tax debt it 's very very difficult to move into your second year of business with a massive tax debt hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's painful that 's why we see 60 percent of small businesses fail in the first three years don 't you let yourself be one of them so pay as you go installments you 're we 're going to have a conversation with you you 're going to call us or contact us and you 're going to say i 'd like to get in the system you can even do it on the business portal and if you 're a sole trader you can do this via mygov so you can register for pay-as-you-go installments tell us how much you reckon you or you think you 're going to earn for the financial year we 're then going to work out your tax we 're going to divide your tax by four by four quarters we 're going to send you an activity statement once a quarter and we 're going to say to you you 're going to need to pay this to be able to meet your end of year taxation obligations now take my kayaking business as an example six months of the year i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year i 'm probably not going to earn great money because of you know it 's seasonal so this is where in the in the six months that i that i don 't earn my money i can vary my pay-as-you-go installment to zero because i 'm not earning any money but in the other six months of the financial year that 's where i 'm earning my money so that 's where i 'm going to vary my pay-as-you-go installments upwards and i 'm going to pay all my tax that 's going to be due when i lodge my tax return i 'm going to pay that in in those six months in the second six months so when i actually go and lodge my tax return i 'm not going to have a tax debt because i 've already paid my tax pay as you go installments is pre-paying your tax takes away that headache have a think about it i 'll leave that one with you so maggie because she employs people she um registers for pay-as-you-go withholding and she enrolls um she goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single touch payroll into the search function now what comes up is software that 's now that you legally now must use if you 're paying people so what single touch payroll software is on the day that you pay your employee is the day that you report the data through your single touch payroll enabled software to the tax office so gone are the days of payment summaries um and annual payment summary reports or you might know it as a group certificate gone are those days gone we now put your data on the day that you pay your employee to the tax office we 've already got that data so this is all part of the black economy you may want to google the blacker common economy but basically what it is it 's money going missing it 's people charging you gst when they 're not registered for gst so they 're pocketing that money it 's ensuring that workers are being paid fairly and ultimately it 's making it 's making a a level playing field for everyone why should you have to pay more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fair so single touch payroll is enabling playing field all right so maggie she lodges her tax return via my tax which is on the connected line which is in your mygov account if you 're a partnership a company or a trust you need to register for mygov id if you want to lodge online so once you register for mygov id you can then go and link to ram and ram is basically the key to the business portal door okay more information head to the ato website so maggie lodges a tax return to the ato maggie receives a 13 small business income tax offset what does that mean it means that you 're going to get taxed less because your taxable income is going to be reduced by 30. so maggie 's costs and complexities are pretty simple she lodges one tax return she uses her own tax file number and she lodges those four activity statements for the year that 's going to have a pay-as-you-go withholding on it her gst and her pay-as-you-go installments pretty simple let 's look at a partnership so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and they love making furniture they love working with wood i totally understand where they 're coming from because i do too so ashley and kevin don 't have any employees and they expect to earn 85 000 for the year so ashley and kevin they need to re australian business number they need to get another tax file number for the partnership so ashley 's got a tax file number kevin 's got a tax file number partnership has also got its own tax file number because they changed the legal structure of their name they needed to get a business name because they earn over 75 000 for the year they needed to register for goods and services tax ashley and kevin are smart they don 't want a tax bill at the end of the year kudos to ashley and kevin alright so let 's have a bit of a look this is how the lodging goes ashley lodges his tax return kevin lodges his tax return now let me be very very clear in relation to how you can set up a partnership so a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go okay so if you if in this particular scenario ashley owns 50 of the partnership kevin owns 50 of the partnership so that means ashley declares 50 of the income that he 's earned through the partnership and so does kevin that means that ashley is responsible for fifty percent of the debt for the partnership and kevin 's responsible for fifty percent uh debt for the for the partnership both ashley ank get the 13 income small business income tax offset then the partnership has to lodge a tax return because the ato will match up what kevin said so what ashley said and what kevin said as to what the whole partnership return says to make sure that all income and all expenses have been declared so now you can see the cost and the complexities building because the partnership needs an extra tax file number okay and there 's going to be a little bit more to lodge with the partnership so this is where i 'm going to head back to the right our fantastic team at the ryde city council and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right city um all the exciting things that are going on and you know jan if i was to move to ryde city council and i 'll tell you something that 's been on my mind for a while i expect to do when i was there well there 's so much happening in the city of ryde we 're very spoiled for open green space lancome national park borders macquarie park and things like that so it 's a great place to be but it 's really a great place if you 're running a business and can everyone hear me okay yeah absolutely yes it 's a really great place to run a business and i 'm really proud to work for the city of ride and the support that they provide for small business and i just want to take you through our guests through some of the support programs and events that are on now you may

diverse group of women very supportive all the women in our group we have over 150 members and when it was before covet we were meeting monthly at wesleyan csiro and we 'd have 35 to 40 women

and no one had to shut down their business now as i said there 's a lot of diverse businesses but please get along to that group on the website where it had all the uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment we 're doing it online as as you would through covert we also have a home-based business group so often starting a business you might be still at home starting this business so i 'd encourage you to go and check out the home-based business group you could send through to council an expression of interest to be part of that group and we 'll get you on the mailing list and make sure you 're kept up to date with everything that 's going on so i do wish you all the best with whatever business venture you 're in and i look forward to hearing what linden has to share for the rest of the presentation and i 'll meet you at the end again sounds fantastic jen um and also uh they 're coming this saturday on the 17th the one that particularly stood out to me emma emma the yellow wiggle she 's uh she 's going to be live on facebook oh my god i love the wiggles hot potato hot potato i just have a little car that looked just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tune in i 'm really excited i 've now got my weekend set you can tell i 've got kids can 't you absolutely yeah yeah i know crazy all right hey thanks jan and i tell you something um the business support and what 's going on at ride city council as i said it 's phenomenal there 's something for everybody and you know if english is your second language um there 's so much support available for you um you know there 's lots of translator services and there 's lots of different types of webinars and online forums that have been hosted uh in uh your native language so again don 't be afraid to reach out to ryan city council because you know you 're in the best hands so let 's head on into companies so sue 's bush tucker catering company look she 's got three employees and she plans to earn over 150 000 for the year so it 's sue um for running a company she needs to get an australian company number and she would do that through asic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of her name she needs to get a business name um she also needs to apply for an australian business number and the company needs its own tax file number now because she 's earning over seventy five thousand dollars yep you got it she needs to register for gst she 's got employees so she 's gotta register for pay as you go with holding and because sue runs a local um you know food type business she needs a local council permit and she needs to apply for it and pay for it so in this case her council permit cost is six thousand dollars for the year so these are things that you need to check out depending on the type of industry that you 're going to get into so this is how it works the company lodges the tax return showing um all that it 's earned for the financial year sue then lodges her because she 's going to show how many how much um that she 's withdrawn in director 's fees because soon needs to obviously live and she needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small business tax income offset the reason why is because company tax rates are lower head to ato.gov dot a u and pop in tax rates and you 'll see what i mean so now you can see the cost and the complexity grows as you as you go from soul trader to partnership to company now we 're going to talk about trusts so welcome to the morton and albert family trust this family trust has got five children and six grandchildren in it now the trust would like to be able to provide for all of their children and their grandchildren so the morton and alberts look they 've engaged a local tax agent by the name of ruby now ruby 's now the trustee of the trust so the morton and alberts will continue to use ruby 's services to establish the trust now ruby 's going to be resp for managing all of the trust tax obligations including registering the trust in the tax system and lodging tax at the trust tax income tax returns so look on behalf of the trust ruby 's required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file number and before the trust can legally operate the trust has got to have a compulsory legal document called a trust deed so the morton and alberts engage a solicitor to draw up the deed so as you can see the cost is growing and the complexity of lodging paperwork and filling out paperwork is growing so the dress the sorry the trust deeds include uh the trust deeds include things like the name of the trust uh the name of the trustee the purpose or the reason of the trust the rights and obligations of the trustee and when and how much money will be given to the beneficiaries so as the trustee ruby must follow the trust deed and operate the trust on behalf of the beneficiaries so ruby can use the trust assets to cover any debts owed to the trust now when ruby receives trust dividends she distributes the money evenly between the beneficiaries as set out in the trust deed now if all of the profit is not distributed the trust will have to pay 47 tax on any money that 's not distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example so my parents had a company and they also had a family trust i was raised on a dairy farm in western australia and no joke uh uh i 'm not joking when i say this the day i was born was the day my parents applied for a tax file number i 've even got the date of lodgement it 's quite sad really but anyway my parents were determined that they were going to look after their family and that i was then known as beneficiary so as a beneficiary i had to lodge my own tax return i mean obviously my parents did it on my behalf um you know until i was 18. um but um so i wasn 't even 12 months and my parents were lodging a tax return because i was known as a beneficiary so to operate the trust they need an australian business number the trust needs its own tax file number they had to register for goods and services tax because they were going to earn over 180 000 for the year and this is how the lodgement works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget you leave money in a trust you 're going to have to pay 47 tax on that money now each member of the morton and albert family they have to lodge a tax return because they 're a beneficiary they must declare how much income that they 've earned as a beneficiary from the trust now each beneficiary is going to receive a 13 small business income tax offset and let me just remind you if you weren 't already aware that the um last year 's small business income tax offset was eight percent so it 's actually um up from eight percent to thirteen percent it 's another covert measure to be able to assist small business so now you can see the difference between a sole trader what 's required a partnership how much it costs and what 's required to be lodged a company what 's required to be lodged um and what needs to be applied for and the and a trust in relation to how a trust deed works engaging engaging your tax agent in relation to being trustee of the trust um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we highlight we encourage that you seek professional advice so head to your right city council ask them what where can you you know how can you help me who can you send me on to to get a little bit of assistance in this space um and again i my um email address into the chat box just in case you

taxes so you can pay people like me to be able to educate you win-win really isn 't it all right so look let 's keep going so if you want to have a full vision of what 's going to be required to be able to run your small business head here head to business dot gov dot a u but head to abbas abilis is going to ask you some very simple questions it 's going to ask you in relation to how you 're @ @

cuppa and have a bit of a think would probably be the first thing but the second thing is google a business plan have a look at a business plan and if i 've helped you with sending you to business.gov

relation to what do i do next well i seek professional advice talk to others in the industry check out the benchmarks do a bit of education because chances are if you educate yourself you 're going to be a success and i really mean that you will be a success if you educate yourself and if you 're not afraid to reach out put your hand up ask the questions so i say this with a smile but um ato is

every year to celebrate our diversity and our harmony is something that this council support year on year recently we 've joined two great new campaigns to bring together our community even more the racism not welcome campaign headed by craig foster will be a fantastic way for us all to celebrate our diversity and to call out racism where it exists in our community we 're also part now of a group of councils called welcoming cities where we make positive statements about welcoming diverse communities here in the city of ryde we 're so lucky to live in such a fantastic diverse city i really hope you enjoy this year 's online version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you again perhaps at next year 's harmony day in person uh so we can celebrate our diversity together thank you hi victor i 'm an elo minister for customer service member for ryde can i begin by acknowledging country pay my respects to all this both past and present can i also wish you all a very happy harmony day when i think of harmony i think of this beautiful korean proverb that says a great river never refuses small streams and when you think about it australia is that great river over the years she 's accepted streams of people from all around the world streams of people from iran from italy from indonesia from ireland and every time a new stream comes into the river it brings in new nutrients new foods new histories new lessons and in exchange what does the river provide it provides a sense of direction a place to call home a place that is safe a place where we can belong and over the years every time a new stream comes into this beautiful river the river gets deeper it gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world stage australia is one of the most magnificent rivers so i want you to really think about harmony day think about where you 've come from in my case i have italian heritage and i 'm so proud of my italian heritage but i belong to australia so please on harmony day celebrate your heritage celebrate who you are but also celebrate the fact that you belong to this beautiful australian family so happy holiday good day everyone namaste niihau konichiwa assalamualaikum satsriyakaal i 'm gary patney a resident of mars field in the city of i 'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land the value medical people and elders past and present so why is it that we celebrate harmony day each year i suspect that if i were to ask a random sample of people on the street not many would be able to tell me this day has a solemn origin it was proclaimed by the united nations general assembly in 1966 in remembrance of the events that took place in sharpville south africa on 21st march 1960 on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacefully against apartheid laws killing 69 people and injuring 180. the observance of this day is meant to remind us that the world cannot be complacent about eliminating racial discrimination especially in a country as multicultural as australia around 45 percent of australia 's population has migrated to australia or has at least one parent who was a migrant i 'm a part of this percentage as i 'm sure many of you would be multiculturalism is such a deep-rooted part of australia 's national identity and is something all of us must work together to support i think one of the greatest achievements a city of right could strive for is the ability to exist together in strong communities in which people see each other for who they are as people first without defining them by a race or religion putting the effort into understanding another person 's culture and beliefs is a way of creating such relationships and showing acceptance is something each one of us can work towards implementing not just today but in our everyday lives in order to understand what harmony day means to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations here are some snippets [Music] [Music] and i 'm a counselor with the city of right and the chairperson of its multicultural advisory committee and i would like to welcome you all for today 's online harmony day event i would like to start by acknowledging the william daigle people who are the traditional custodian of this land i would also like to pay respect to the elders both past and present of the direct nation and extend that respect to other aboriginal and torres strait islander people today we celebrate harmony day and it 's his theme of everyone belongs as you know the city of ride is an amazing diverse community made up of people born here overseas and speaking many languages like myself it has been the work of its council to put into place many practical strategies to ensure that everyone feels that they belong and have an opportunity to participate and contribute to the for all communities various communities coming from everywhere to participate in it and performance all of their backgrounds religions language arts music folklore dance even foods and sweet stalls excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this day is for those communities from various directions to work together and to communicate with each other and to accept each other and this is the real meaning work of them bringing together communities and understanding each other 's religion their customs their tradition which in turn helps understand each other i think that 's very important and that way we can you know participate in each other 's festivals in different traditions thereby bringing harmony to this beautiful country it 's all about inclusiveness and i think that 's what i feel harmony is thank you harmony is a result of removing the fear of the unknown to become the truth we fear people because we do not know what different cultures have i think harmony is a tool in order to expose the unknown to become known so therefore we accept the differences and celebrate it and i think this is very very important and this is what makes australia unique and that 's what makes it a competitive advantage for a lot of australians we understand different cultures quicker than the rest of the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we understand uh scavenge the differences and once you know the differences the next part is i accept you and for me to accept you as different it 's the biggest celebration of a strong way of life so that 's what we see so i think that 's why celebrating harmony day within the australian society is such an important aspect because it celebrates diversity it celebrates inclusiveness and it brings us brings us all together i think he helped every single one of us um overcome the cultural shock it allows us to understand the different aspects of the australian culture because we meet new people we learn through their experiences and um initially when you come in as a first generation migrant you might you might be you might go through cultural shock and then i think being a part of a specific community whether it 's through volunteering groups or if it 's through your work environment um being able to connect with people who have shared similar experiences it allows you to connect and feel a sense of belonging so when i came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you feel a bit lost but there are people from australian community who came to us and helped us to integrate and take us to events and all of that but people who are coming now they are it 's more easier for them to integrate into australian society because they are every community around for every different cultural background but i think there should be more interaction between different communities to not just sit on one side okay we have between different communities and that was my dream from when i was in india i should see the movies as you see different different things but then when you come here you see that you 're all the same people are people right regardless of color or creed or religion but one thing that i also love that you 've got to give as well you can 't sit back you know it 's it 's give and take when you give and take with the other communities only then that you feel a sense of belonging and people respect you you know but if you get isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the new migrants who come here who can 't speak you know as you put it you know there 's a lot of new uh migrants are having a lot of facilities and that 's why you know there 's so many different interpreters the different socioeconomic groups there 's you know counseling services you know and we are one of those that we 're doing right now you know to impart knowledge of you know of new migrants in the city of ryan so i think uh it 's very important that the awareness is on you as well to interact and you know try and mix mingle with different communities i 'm really appreciative of um australia 's government to take this initiative of uh making this harmony day really out there and then be presentable to uh accessible to a lot of people of every culture and from every nation because um when you feel you 're welcome then you kind of feel like you can also do something back for the society so then it 's more like an active um interactive sort of like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh being pushed back and paid back by the people uh in that way we 're not just coming to this country to take because people came here they took but they also start to give and we came here to take and then it 's also for us to give so that when the new people come then they can feel this is really welcome back hope you found these conversations insightful the city of ryde is fortunate to have such a large culturally diverse population with a rich colorful heritage and history several of our community members are talented artists cmrc and the city of right council took the opportunity to invite these members to submit their videos performing their art here 's a compilation of those videos [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music]

he comes from iran and the teacher was she was from yugoslavia background and she was explaining some of the english things and all the students had their picture people to understand and translate the words according to our language because we all knew didn 't understand the thing and and then the teachers talked about marilyn monroe and i mean get the dictionary check it out because i don 't understand so we didn 't even know that marilyn monroe was an actress and foreign story indicate to us that how much the australian government has put into the system and processing the program to allow all these migrants to be together we had the iranian we had the greek and all these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know can speak english and we one of the one of the australian teachers here will get the sheila and none of us knew what she learned you know and then the guy i think was in the canteen with a guy called david and we asked david what does sheila mean it 's a girl it 's a girl so it 's but and you think about it it is this combination of a program that allows people like me and like kevin and like everybody else to learn english i could not speak one single word at all i mean it was very good in french i was very good in arabic but my english was almost zero and the system was that you go at my 12 weeks program and after 12 weeks the government will not pay you to attend because they used to pass 20 dollars and then i rely then i realized that at nighttime they do an english course so i did it for eight years because i knew it was free i couldn 't believe it so i go to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it for eight years and then i went to university when i was 32. but the question is it is because of this problem that the government put that as a result of this initiative like the holiday day that actually will find the benefit of it not now for generations to come and that 's that story of harmony right for me even i came here with my kids and i don 't know anyone i came as a refugee but not the condition that refugee 2006 in lebanon there was very bad world and all the hosanna government brought them to australia so we came here my husband came after two years i said i don 't know anyone here but the community our community took us we attended the new useful armenian community church everything that one is one of the maybe good and bad opportunities that you can 't mix with the other cultures but later i tried to mix with the like i worked with look good feel better as a cancer counselor with the australian to practice my english and i couldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me but now i 'm feeling that i have to go and emerge more in the this community and this is why the harmony that you meet introduce the people that you feel they are they are good for you and you have to help them and give whatever you have but i uh that time army and even his community our neighbors were only venice so i couldn 't go to see other cultures it was the street that i was living they are all rebellions i speak arabic i can live with them and armenians also so i couldn 't have that opportunity to go more but now i 'm trying to be to meet other interviewers friends customers much more example meeting with one or mixed with one community or the armenian or lebanese and that 's it but in the harvard page you can see everyone like people from middle east south africa south america europe middle east and so on so this is the the power of the the word i can say and believe me it is in australia and the new south wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too and every year of course the australian government they got like a number of events and anzac day australia 's day remembrance day one of those important day is the harmony where all those communities comes together in a showcase to say their fault lord their dance their music diversity language religion so very colorful very powerful one so keep going as communities all together working together accepting israel understanding each other working together so this is the most important thing and to keep it for the next generation to continue that and that is what we do in jail and we can see the different cultures there coming together study them but at the same time mixing with each other and then it starts what we are doing today which we can see there and then that somewhere our wedding was starting maybe 25 years back journey here yeah which is very she 's told it as she feels you know because a lot of people like she didn 't need because her community supported her exactly and she had other responsibilities with her kids and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that hey now it 's my time to give and mingle and understand the other cultures and perfect that 's a great example that it comes all together like what usually you do in the few years before in the we 're doing the karma we call it carnival at ryde park yes unfortunately we can 't do it it 's so beautiful like most colorful one and all of them like someone entering to the garden full of roses and flowers but every single rose and every single flower is different than each other different in the same different color different in in the design different and everything and the same thing we are and you listen to that particular language and you learn something from them listen to that in music you listen to even part of instruments which is never ever see something like that and comes from their mouth is so beautiful and this is a character multicultural for her for example which is like a good example meeting with one or mixed with one community or the armenian or lebanese and that 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from middle east south africa well uh look looking at the future all i can and from that point of where we are we have been successfully integrated into as a migrant into the community now and looking at the future uh i think we need to have more outreach programs towards the society particularly for example k what she told and [Music] from that background and there are many communities which if you can what you call understand that they have their own barriers so the more programs we go and do the outreach and then bring the successful migrants out to support each other i think it 's a good way to looking for and australia still is a young country and it 's a small population and if you look at the media today they 're expecting because they 're all worried the migraine is being my the immigration has stopped and a lot of people are worried in the government area that we need to make have more migration whatever right in terms of the economy so this is going to go as well and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is required welcome back hope you found these conversations insightful the city of ride is fortunate to have such a large culturally diverse population with a rich colorful heritage and history several of our community members are talented artists cmrc and the city of right council took the opportunity to invite these members to submit their videos performing their art here 's a compilation of those videos [Music] oh [Music] is [Music]

so much further let 's all make harmony day a day where we truly come together to celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you for watching and wishing you all a happy harmony day [Music] g 'day [Music]

    "text": "thank you everybody for attending this electric vehicle webinar this evening my name is diego zun i 'm council 's senior sustainability coordinator for transport and environment and i 'm leading the electric vehicle innovation program for council we have a fantastic lineup of speakers tonight that will draw on their personal and professional experiences to provide an overview of electric vehicle technology in australia just a few housekeeping rules before we get started if you have a question please type it into the q a box and our speakers will do their best to answer towards the end of the webinar the questions that we cannot answer today will be addressed at a later date and will be sent to your registered emails also please note that council is not endorsing these specific businesses that may be associated with our presenters and yes this webinar is being recorded and will be circulated both events um i would now like to welcome our mr mayor councillor laxalt to provide an overview of the latest initiatives by council regarding electric vehicle transition in our city thanks diego and hello everybody my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ryde and welcome to this awesome webinar that our staff have put on today thank you to the amazing speakers who no doubt give us a lot of information about electric vehicles and it 's really exciting that as a council we 're putting on this event because we 've gone through quite the transformation over the last couple of years when it comes to things surrounding the environment climate change and electric vehicles for the first time we 've also purchased some electric vehicles and we 're trying those out and we know that um we saw feedback on electric vehicle uptake across our city and three out of four who responded said that they 'd be looking to purchase electric vehicles uh to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to transition away from fossil fuels it 's something we 've done as a council and it 's something that we 're keen to encourage our community to to do as well to reduce our local emissions footprint as part of moving towards a cleaner and greener future obviously one of the biggest barriers to electric vehicle update is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like as charging and i 'm pleased to announce that later this year we 'll commence a pilot roll out of electric charging stations in this in three town centres across the city of ryde so we 're going along with this process too um we hope you can join us and that you know the city of wright can be a leader in the uptake of electric vehicles and renewable technologies again thank you to our amazing staff who have uh driven this transition as well no pun intended obviously and um and i i 'll hand it over to our host and and our amazing speakers thanks and thank you to everyone um you know who 's joined today and hopefully um you can have some of your questions answered and um take up that you know that next car you buy can be can be an electric one cheers all right can i throw to bryce to kick us off oh yes thank you i 'll quickly do my share screen so if you 'll bear with me for a moment whilst i get the technology working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to get a view and a full screen mode how does that look for everyone beautiful okay my name is bryce gate and i actually come from the australian electric vehicle association and i 'll try and keep myself to a good 15 minutes so i 'm just writing down the time that i started just to be sure okay i 'm going to quickly go through for what why when guide to ev choice in australia so basically to start with a bit of pv terminology because i have a bad habit of using a whole lot of terms that people may or may not know i also will go through what 's available in australia in the world i 'll go through why it benefits both you and the environment to buy an ev and then i 'll go through when might be the time to move to an ev in your household so first up um i 'll be running an exam at the end by the way people this is the ev terminology that gets thrown around a lot of the place these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with plug-in electric vehicles are those that plug into some sort of power outlet and whoops i 'm getting a bit of feedback i plug into a uh outlet um so you 've got your battery electric vehicle your bev you 've got your one your plug-in hybrid vehicle which has both plug and oil petrol which or diesel with all run then you come to the hybrid electric vehicle which is the original priuses and those types of things which are electric motor saving power to the battery on braking and then reusing that power to save petrol into the future so you can say between about five and fifteen percent of the petrol which we 're using i tend not to call them their electric vehicles anymore because they if you run out of petrol they stop because they 're based on petrol electricity and the fourth electric car that 's often talked about is the hydrogen car or the fuel cell electric car they do run on hydrogen but they use hydrogen in a chemical reaction to create electricity and then run the electric motor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run because the hydrogen basically will run at a very constant pace it doesn 't take acceleration very well and it can 't regenerate hydrogen you can only redo it by filling in a fuel station type setup you know they 're the basic types i 'll be sticking to the battery electric vehicles today uh another common term that 's used by people is an ebse uh commonly or somewhat erroneously in some cases called car charger but that 's what we call them today you can have your ac types which is the type that 's used with your power points or general electrical supplies and households they 're the three on your left and on the right of the big dc type ones that you use in the highways uh for instance those ones i 've managed to do melbourne to canberra to sydney and then up to coffs harbour and then because of the bushfires last year i came back from costa before in two days and i just use the nrma network of those big ones on your right there and i could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very successful improvement on that trip that you don 't get slowed down anymore by any electric car over a petrol anymore okay moving to the next slide i also try to remind people that electric vehicles are not just cars and we have everything from trucks bicycles motorbikes it 's a whole eevee revolution all transport is moving toward the 50 and getting rid of the fossil fuels everything in that picture by the way except for one that 's at the bottom left uh so bottom right is available either for order or for sale now the one at the bottom right is exists why everything there exists but it is a low-speed test vehicle built here in coyote in melbourne australia so yeah don 't forget it 's not just cars but that 's what white sport today will be about what 's available in the world well bucket loads would be uh the short short answer and there 's lots more coming there 's many dozens in fact working out to i think about 100 and something electric vehicles both plug-in and full battery available around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here you 'll see it looks like the vw copy that 's called the id buzz that should be 2023 the one at the top with a sort of the red stripey effect on the blue is the vw id3 which are literally rolling off the production line at the moment and that will be hitting european showrooms in very large numbers very soon you can actually start ordering and i think they 're just starting to deliver them now and then the unfortunately we won 't be seeing that one in australia by the way that will be getting what 's called the id4 which is that red sweeping one roughly in the lower center anyway lots available lots more cutting australia not quite so much we i was looking better than it was another year or so but we have oh i 've actually just realized as of yesterday i 've got to delete the renault zoe that will no longer be for sale so we have we were up to nine we 're now back to eight so eighteen we 're up to eleven we 're now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being a smaller car manufacturer in australia supplier in australia as opposed they are the biggest light vehicle manufacturer in the world the renault alliance but they just couldn 't find it easy selling a small market car for them versus hyundai and nissan can sell these in much larger numbers because they have much bigger presence in australia so sadly what was quite an icv has now been pulled but anyway they 're sort of numbers i won 't go through them in detail there are a whole only two small number coming out of the selection of the overseas ones i showed mg zs should be here quite soon later this year there you go if you start ordering them now they were from forty seven thousand dollars on the road to the first hundred patches you order it um the ones i have question marks on i 'm relatively hopeful to be here next year i 'm sorry with this year uh a tesla model why i put that as a dark course because it 's ahead of schedule on production so i 'm hoping that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year which i 'm talking about comfortably ahead and i 've actually just shipped a couple to new zealand for testing so that 's and by the way there 's actually if you look at the ev automotive one here the ec-11 then that 's a one three-quarter ton van with a really good range and that 's being brought in by a private importer and that should be available in quarter four this year so just under a hundred thousand dollars but a very good range a very good vehicle um you can buy second-hand ones here in australia so you do have some options there i won 't go through those in detail but there 's a number options and these are all delivered to australia by the manufacturers as you may have heard there 's a number of people bringing in what are called grey imports and that 's the next slide uh you can actually buy some of these vehicles that are brought in mainly from japan they 've been brought in and they 're secondhand vehicles due to the japanese requirements for cars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and force people to update and buy new cars to keep the market going we get the option of quite low mileage quite good cars coming here there 's a couple of schemes being set up for important numbers and providing some sort of warranty and technical support but there have been have been a number brought in by private importers and there is issues there that they have no warranty and that no dealers or dealers don 't want to touch grey imports generally the schemes are being set up like for good car it 's up in new south wales and tasmania and we 'll be in victoria again once the covered restrictions down here have re-lifted again but they are setting up warranty and dealer networks so worth a check out there 's some of the longer range leafs related model lists you can buy the emv van the mia mini up basically the media mini cab is a based on the iv it 's the similar mechanicals um for those of you are feeling really daring you could pick up one of the converted plated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now but they 're not they 're an interesting vehicle but i 've got a reputation for fixing them although i think i 've got post-traumatic stress disorder from from doing them because just about every one of them was a different vehicle to the previous they 're all effectively prototypes there 's about 50 of them around you pick them up quite cheap if you 're a hands-on person but i wouldn 't go there if you just buy a car to drive day-to-day anyway we 're going to look at why an ev benefits you and the environment uh first of all for the moment you get no tar pipe pollution so in inner city areas or city just city corners school yard parking areas you don 't have that power pipe pollution the overall emissions which i 've talked about next are reduced overall and negative emissions are using solar wind power you get reduction in waste coolants oil brake pads plugs all that sort of stuff um yes there are some issues sourcing the minerals for them but that applies to a lot of needles digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with labor market practices and basically mining and should need to clean itself up there so i don 't think ev 's are the single cause of the problem anyway um moving right along for you definitely your service costs are reduced and i 'll talk about that at the moment all electricity is definitely cheaper than petrol and if you 're using the right terrace and charging overnights you can be very cheap and if you 're using your own solder effectively free okay uh a lot of people ask you this question so i 'll just quickly bring it up if you 're driving a new or 2017 in this case corolla for 10 000 kilos a year you 'll put out roughly two tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year for that driving if you 're driving around in tasmania buying an equivalent size car which is the bmw i3 you 're putting out a quarter of the time because of the hydroelectricity component there and even in victoria with our horrible brown pole for the city cycle you 're still putting out less carbon dioxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less emissions than you would be from an equivalent new petrol car and the other side of the coin is as the grid cleans up that gets better and better if we 're moving towards south australia 50 mix or tasmania with a very high proportion of hydro we 're getting rid of that carbon emission very nicely by the way if anybody 's interested in the detail of these slides because i am moving quite quickly you can email me i 'll put the email address up at the end of this session um i will do this very briefly if you 're looking at a renault zoe which is a quite efficient little small car deposit around town or around sort of the outer melbourne or outer city regions you 'll be spending 330 dollars extra in your electricity bill but it 's not spending 1200 in petrol for that roughly 10 000 k 's so you 're saving over nearly 900 petrol to start with fuel costs you 're saving significant amount of petrol so for every 10 000 k 's roughly you 're saving eleven twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking at okay again i 'm not going to go through the detail tonight these all actually come from an article that 's written and circled down the bottom on the driven but it 's there 's a whole set of criteria when you might want to consider so if you 're looking for something that does 50 kilometers or more per day pretty much every ev available now will do it if you 're doing 400 more kilometers or more a day then you 're looking at the tesla 's the hyundai camera and that 's about it above it so but and everything you 've seen in between if you 're looking for the carpet towing pretty much at the moment the model of three tests of the kangoo zd jaguar ipace and the model x will do it and that 's about it at the moment i could talk more to that one another day um if you 're looking for something around the 60 000 or under there 's not a lot of choice the ioniq and the nissan leaf and a few demonstrator konas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kangaroo uh if you 're looking at a used one which i mentioned there 's a number of vehicles that if you 're beetling around a town or country really short region area then pretty much they 'll always do it too and you 're getting something under 30 000 or even 20 thousand dollars for the finance and beliefs if you 're looking at the practicalities of the navy then you 're getting to you need to think about your switchboard and street cable as you see there if that 's an old switchboard you may actually have to upgrade because of the electric cars fault that you 're upgrading it it 's it 's just sort of triggered the need to do it i 've written a number of articles on these things uh we new magazine put out by the review organization edition 143 there or our australian electric people association newsletter ev news also has that if you have somewhere else to charge the street like i have with my previous car vendors and leaf that 's quite handy if you haven 't not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe some fast charges around the place or the local service status locals shopping center may in fact have a free ev charging point there you need to work out your electricity tariffs because they can make it quite wary or less expensive if you 're charging at the higher peak rate during the day you might be paying four times as much as it would overnight an electric car unlike an air conditioner you can choose when to charge it whereas any condition you need to run it at a particular time and no other and you might need to buy some extra adapters and things but that 's a few extra doors so that 's the practicalities there 's also when you consider you don 't have an option anymore and there 's a number of countries and more jumping on this bandwagon where they 're actually setting dates for the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles um and some of them with large automotive automotive manufacturing capacity are starting to set those dates so things like france uk has set 2040 2035 and the uk are about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2032. so eventually we 'll not be able to buy them anymore um if you want to find out more about electric vehicles we have a website with a whole series of fact sheets available that 's the ava.asn.edu site and if you 'd like to join and help us in promoting evs and helping eb owners get the best out of their cars it 's not a very expensive membership for an individual it 's 50 concession rate it 's 25 and for a corporate member that 's 325 a year and you get a quarterly newsletter which is about 64 pages magazine size and quality and a whole lot of access to data and information as well as helping us put government submissions together and the like um also we 're having what 's called the 2020 eb vision e-conference it 's now in our third iteration due to all the covert restrictions it was going to be a big in-person conference in melbourne it 's now then moved to an online format and there were the current restrictions we couldn 't actually get businesses to actually commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually had to flow it out a little bit to 27 but that is definitely our set follow the aver website to see what the list of speakers and things the formal program will be listed later this month as i say there the future is clear ev 's are here 20 20 vision um if you 've got any burning questions at the end of all three please make them at the end of all three talks coming up next is brent clark and i 'll quickly swap over my share so i 'll stop sharing i 'll give you a quick intro on brent as he 's finally getting himself organized uh brent is the ceo and founder of energy consultancy work block and what blockers assistant department building buildings housing over sixty thousand residents with solar feasibility energy efficiency and electric vehicle charging reports quad blocks projects include working for advanced queensland new south wales department of planning industry and environment and north sydney mossman and volara councils friends specialises in breaking down the barriers of solar and specializes in ev charging for strata and apartment buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's uh fantastic to see ride council getting right behind the ev revolution with this webinar today so for the next uh 10 minutes uh we 're going to be looking at apartment blogs and if you are an apartment dweller in the city of ryde then you shouldn 't feel like it 's too hard for you to join the electric vehicle charging revolution so we 'll jump straight in and we 're going to have a look at an apartment block that 's located at 133 bowdoin street in meadow bank and we consider this to be a green apartment block a future proof department block and a template for what all the apartment blocks in sydney should be aspiring to be so uh this is a complex of just 58 units and you can see here a photo of a 30 kilowatt solar system on the roof of the apartment building interestingly if you look uh down the rest of the street no solar panels on those other apartment blocks something will hopefully try and fix in the future now the 30 kilowatt solar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart meter network that connects all the apartments and the common area meter in the building which means the solar power is actually uh run helping to run fridges in each of the 58 units during the day and down the bottom you can see there 's an electric vehicle charging station in the basement car park so this is actually has been approved by the strata committee in this building and the thing that we 're really uh excited about is if an electric vehicle were to connect to that electric vehicle charge station during sunlight hours um they would actually be getting solar powered ev charging inside an apartment block right here in the city of ride so this building um developed by sasko and they 've had such a good response from this there 's a second building they 're doing opposite top ride shopping center at 176 back blackstone road and they 're going to do exactly the same thing again so hopefully this is a model of how apartment blocks will be moving into the solar powered electric vehicle charging future and as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sydney this one that we 're looking at right here so i 'll just move on to the next slide uh we 've previously done an eb and strata report in consultation with tesla agl evercharge and the city of sydney and the scope of the project we interviewed over 700 residents uh living in 80 different uh strata schemes and we did deep dives on 20 of those apartment blocks just to see what could be done to get them road mapping their apartment buildings for electric vehicle charging and here are some of the participating uh strider buildings that we worked with as you can see electric vehicles are coming into the premium buildings first and then they 're going to slowly come down into the medium apartment blocks and finally uh we 'll be retrofitting our 60s and 70s uh three-story walk-ups so some key findings 79 of people living in the apartment buildings uh wanted a user pay system for electric vehicle charging and 78 of people were in favor of installing charge systems right now uh most importantly people want the charge station to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people are wanting that um unfortunately um only eleven percent of people knew the location of the nearest public charging station and we just heard from the mayor of the city of ryde that uh three um public charging stations are going to be uh scoped out over the coming year in the city of ryde area and as the awareness of where fast charging is located and potentially some slower charging inside your apartment building um permeates through the community more people will be um you know buying these electric vehicles um so just if you 're in an apartment block a couple of challenges you 've got to make sure you 've got enough capacity on your switchboard um you uh you may have to put new cable trays through your basement car park to get that faster charging speed to the individual car spots we 'll come back and we 'll talk about uh visitor parking a bit of a contentious uh issue inside our strata schemes but now is the time to get your bylaws in place new bylaws perhaps for charging in both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment building so as i mentioned in our apartment blocks um there 's not typically a lot of extra car parking space um you know strata schemes are trying to make sure not too many people are parking there for too long particularly residents inside the building so maybe this is not the best place to be putting a communal car charger maybe we should be uh working on those solutions to get the charging into the individual car spots this is what 's happening today this is a real life photo a couple of challenges here that basement car park has actually flooded in the past uh it 's a trip hazard cars are driving over that uh power cable so this is absolutely not the ideal way to charge an electric vehicle in a strata basement car park and a few apartment buildings have meter boards that look like this and uh you know electric vehicles are a perfect opportunity to get a refresh of your electrical infrastructure in the building and prepare for that new energy future um also think about car share spots in strata it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car share spot that might be available to people outside the building or if you 've got a block of 100 uh or so apartments uh there 's now companies that will provide you with a dedicated uh tesla model 3 that can be a car share that can be put into one spot in the basement car park are opened with a mobile phone app and only used by people inside that apartment building so um i 'll now hand over for the next section to evan darm uh he 's the director and principal consultant of charge works an independent consultancy in solar pv battery storage and eb charging he 's an ev driver himself uh committed to clean energy and is providing consulting and training to local and state government agencies across new south wales he also teaches foundations in renewable energy and sustainability at the new south wales tafe so over to you evan thank you brent thank you for that presentation okay so i believe i 'm sharing my screen um brent just because i know you 're still available can you see my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away thank you very much okay right so a bit about charge works we do a lot of our business in car parks um i 'm not the most fun to take on holidays you can ask my wife whenever we go on holidays here here was our trip to cairns and we went sightseeing as you can see to um to the end of the fast charge network that has appeared in in queensland my consultancy is an independent focusing on uh what charging technology is available what um electric vehicles are coming to uh to australia um i 've personally been driving electric vehicles for for five years now um and i um help councils and small businesses uh to look at how they can introduce ev charging infrastructure into their sites as well as looking at ev vehicles for for their fleets so that 's about me i 've traveled all across new south wales um and charge works have um pretty much wherever we go we have a look at what the charging infrastructure is in the in the towns and cities that we visit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles than there are in australia we 're starting to see what the future is going to be like for australia playing out in other markets around the world so that 's a very good insight as to what 's coming because we we just need to look over at the more mature markets to see how they 're doing it and take the best ideas and um and makes the transition for australia a little bit straightforward because we can see how other countries are doing it so what i 'll be talking about is the projections that i 've been seeing in terms of future ev growth that are that are happening around the world and in australia i 'll be talking about the benefits of an ev as well as the barriers to ev adoption here in australia i 'll be talking about charging technology as well as the link with solar and renewable charging and also a bit about my own personal experience because you may be sitting there thinking should i buy an ev what uh what what are the pitfalls and the benefits how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my own personal spin on it before we get to a q a because i know brent and bryce have had their own point of view as drivers for for many years so i 'm going to start off with um referring to bloomberg new energy finances 2020 electric vehicle outlook and basically they 're saying that in the next five years evs will hit 10 of global sales rising to 28 in 2030 and 58 by 2040. now if we refer to um the this chart on the left here which is uh ending in 2023 we can see that china is really driving sales much higher and what and there are other lag guards such as in um in india and in sub-saharan africa that are a little bit more of a laggard but what we 're seeing is that there is a quite a difference in where you look around the world as to what the uptake is so whilst we might say okay it 's only 28 by 2030 if we look at 2030 we 're going to see more than 50 percent of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales that is and and other countries such as europe are not far behind so within 10 years the the basically the majority of sales in in those more mature markets will be all electric um and whilst others will be laggards basically we 're saying within 20 years more than half of all of global sales will have gone electric but it 's very interesting to note that china is really leading the way and they have a um a big sway when it comes to this disruption now the main driver of ev adoption while sustainability and action on climate change is of course an important and important motivator to switching to a low emissions transport really what 's driving this disruption is dollars the price parity between an internal combustion vehicle that you may be driving today and an electric vehicle that is the the price that you will actually pay to drive it off the lot is expected to to intersect with um internal combustion engines by the mid-2020s so within five years um we we would expect in australia that say for thirty thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they should be about the same price now large cars in europe where fuel excise um and other um taxes and incentives mean that within two years we may see the capital cost of electric vehicles and internal combustion engines reach price parity within two years in europe whilst some of the smaller vehicles in india and japan which are very cheap to make internal combustion engines today it may be 10 years before price parity occurs so we 're talking about the capital cost of buying the cars somewhere within the next 10 years is going to is going to reach parity starting with the large cars and then moving to to the small cars but ev ownership isn 't just about the upfront cost the total cost of ownership of a vehicle especially if you drive it a lot may already be at price parity today so for example if you buy a 50 000 electric car such as a nissan leaf or a hyundai ioniq such as the city of ride have purchased you 'll find that you break even around about 126 000 kilometers so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year then you 'll basically break even on buying an electric vehicle over over a cheaper petrol car um by the time you hit that sort of mileage so if you if you do a lot of case say 20 000 um kilometers a year within six years you 'll have made your money back so we 're almost at price parity already electric vehicles that are a bit larger such as the kona or um or larger suvs they they are more expensive so you have to drive them more in order to to recover the fuel costs so about 150 000 kilometers and big utes that that um you know are um much more expensive such as the tesla cyber truck and the riveon r1t that are more than a hundred thousand dollars you have to drive them a lot to save enough fuel to to break even but as we see the capital cost of those vehicles come down we 're going to start seeing that break-even mileage come even closer and whilst you might be looking at these numbers saying well it 's it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to consider is that some people are so if you think about things like transport as a service providers such as goget or potentially car next door or other new business models that may come up um brent just talked about a ride share within a strata building they may be doing high case so taxis for example or other ride sharing services may be doing a quarter of a million kilometers within a couple of years so electric vehicles are already making sense for them and the day that autonomous vehicles are permitted where these cars are basically driving themselves without needing to sleep and they 're driving continually rest assured a 200 000 electric vehicle that can drive itself is cheaper than a 50 000 petrol car simply because of the total cost of ownership so whilst we might be saying that adoption is 10 to 20 years away if things like autonomous vehicles are sooner than that then basically the ev becomes cheaper to afford straight away now as brice mentioned um the transition may happen well before 2040 because uh for example in norway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2025 in norway and even in india and and israel and ireland and these other countries here they 're basically saying we 're going to ban the sale of petrol cars by these sort of dates so whilst the bloomberg outlook just looks at the the economics the government may enforce transition even earlier it 's interesting to note that the uk have targets around 2032 uh they 're a large right-hand drive market so what will that mean for australia if if the uk and the right-hand drive vehicles you can 't buy them anymore maybe manufacturers will only make electric vehicles it 's an interesting thought to think when will australia ban the sale of the internal combustion engine it 's pretty hard to imagine that it 'll be in our lifetime but uh you know quite potentially the the economics could drive this to to make this happen anyway or we simply won 't be able to buy them because nowhere else in the world will they be available we have approximately 12 million electric vehicles sold in globally in 2019 and that 's driven mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year alone the united states and europe were were second and third and all others made up a fairly small proportion just in australia we have six thousand seven hundred and eighteen electric vehicles sold last year which is a hundred and fifty percent year-on-year increase that was mainly driven by sales of the tesla model 3 and to some extent the hyundai range of vehicles the total amount of electric vehicles in australia is now around about fifteen thousand so we 're getting there but in comparison to what 's happening in china with three point three million we 're we 're fairly small in in the grand scheme of things and we 'll really be driven by what 's happening around the world to put in perspective of what china is doing uh shenzhen for example they have a population of i believe over 20 million they have more than 20 000 electric taxis on their roads and that represents 99 of the of this particular taxi fleet and these vehicles are all electric so you can imagine the scale of production that 's happening in china to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what we 're seeing this scale of production is driving down the cost and making electric vehicles more affordable to manufacture at scale also what 's interesting to note is that shenzhen have a 100 electric bus fleet which they completed in 2017 here they all are about 13 000 buses run this city and they 're all electric and each one of these buses has enough batteries to run a run a small building so the amount of batteries that are being made in china is what 's really driving this transition and getting that cost of say fifty thousand dollar car down to a thirty thousand dollar car over the next few years simply at this sort of scale of production you don 't have to go to china to jump on electric bus if you happen to be in london whenever you 're allowed to travel again the uh london have more than 60 electric buses or if you 've flown or been to the domestic airport in the last couple of years out of sydney or brisbane they have fleets of electric buses that transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and act also have a couple of vehicles on trial new south wales government has announced the plan to look at 8 000 electric buses over the next couple of years and basically transfer transform the entire metropolitan fleet over to electric and going back to i was talking about where if you 're doing lots of case it makes sense to go to ev now just on dollars alone this is why we 're seeing buses in china other countries around the world and also in australia here transferring to electric vehicles also what 's happening other than the bus fleet initiatives but the new south wales government this year have announced their future transport 2056 plan which includes electric and hybrid vehicles and i 've included the link here um in the in the presentation materials when they 're distributed but i 'm sure you can find this if you have a bit of a google but there are two key elements within the new south wales electric and hybrid vehicle plan the first is a set 10 target for excuse me for the new south wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months so a 10 target for electric and hybrid vehicles and as brice mentioned in his presentation the fact that government is now going to be purchasing these vehicles and turning them over in the next couple of years it may mean that new vehicles for government that are fifty thousand dollars enter the second-hand market at much more affordable prices so if you 're thinking that a 50 000 electric vehicle is a bit too dear for you today um keep an eye out for the uh the um secondhand market in the next couple of years which is one of the key tenets of this new south wales plan the other interesting thing that 's being done by the new south wales government is looking at regional fast charging to unlock the regions all the way from from border to border and from coast to um to south australia and looking at how can we make fast charging more accessible all around new south wales now as it happens i 've i 've got here an overlay of where you can currently fast charge here in new south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the networks that are looking to be supplemented by or supported by the new south wales government is um is in complement to a network that already exists so you may not be aware but you can actually drive pretty much anywhere east of dubbo and up and down the coast without any hassle you can find a fast charger somewhere on that network but the new south wales government is looking to enhance that as well the benefits of electric vehicles are numerous one of the most striking things is never buying petrol again is quite a nice thing to do the cost savings are absolutely clear and i 'm going to talk about that in just a little while you 'd be surprised about how much nicer it is to drive an electric car because it 's quiet it tends to handle better and perform better interesting to note that electric vehicles whilst being quieter also mean that electric trucks are able to deliver after curfew so when the um covert really hit and woolworths and coles were doing their deliveries 24 7 woolworths were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are now continue to deliver after curfew because they 're able to without those noisy trucks the other clear benefit we we can see with electric vehicles is lower emissions so let 's talk about that if you refer to the australian government 's um fuel guidelines the the the um the published emissions forecast uh basically the fuel that you use to drive your car emits 2.36 kilograms of co2 per liter whereas electricity from the grid is only 820 grams per kilowatt hour now there 's about a two to one ratio in terms of kilowatt hours to liters but basically if you have a car that uses 10 liters per 100 ks it 's equivalent to an electric car that uses 20 kilowatt hours if you have a car that 's more efficient you 'd expect an ev equivalent to be less but basically just you from charging from the grid today it 's 31 percent better for the environment to to use electricity um on the in australia than it is to to use fuel so that 's better straight away um if you live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future in new south wales as the grid gets greener we 're going to see that improve as well or you could look at how you can use solar power to charge your electric car so this is six solar panels and i wanted to put this in perspective because six solar panels isn 't really that big that 's enough to generate enough energy to drive your car for a year the equivalent number of petrol barrels is around about nine and a half so you 'd have to stack barrels three wide and twice as tall as as the average person in order to drive a car about 1500 liters in a year so you can see side by side that there 's a lot more fuel required than than the amount of power that 's generated by a solar panel but the thing is that solar keeps generating year-on-year but you don 't renew oil you just have to buy more of it this what it looks like after five years and this is what it looks like after 10 years six solar panels can drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like 100 barrels of oil in order to drive your car for that long so driving using solo is a great way to to improve your sustainability and this really makes it clear if you want to drive net zero putting solar panels on your roof if you can of around about one and a half to two kilowatts is usually enough to offset the average user for a year um alternatively if you like me and you can 't put solar panels on your roof you can buy green power for something like 150 a year should be enough to completely offset all of your um your all of your emissions associated with with generating electricity that you get from the grid and effectively then your zero emissions if you want to drive directly from seoul without doing some kind of an offset what you would look at is something like a five kilowatt solar system where you have enough available energy during the day to directly charge your car in a reasonable time frame so if you have a rooftop solar system chances are you can charge your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric vehicle adoption is the affordability of vehicles um concerns around range anxiety and just general awareness as i mentioned earlier affordability is a capital cost that may cross over within within the next 10 years but affordability in the terms of the total cost of ownership is something that really needs to be looked at when considering electric vehicle typically you you save around about one to four thousand dollars a year depending on how you drive the vehicle now let 's talk about range anxiety the two most common questions i get is where can i charge and how long will it take well here is a picture of ride council turns out there is already public charging available in ride council already so top right have charges um the macquarie center has charges chatswood which is outside the lga but they also have charges as well so there is already a network of public charges and as the mayor has introduced earlier there is more public charging coming into ride council but the fact is that 70 percent of users actually charge at home almost all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging looks like is simply if you have a power point you can charge an electric vehicle you don 't have to go to public charge of the charge if you have a power point you 're ready to charge or you can install a dedicated fast charger like the photograph i have here sorry excuse me not a dedicated fast charger just a dedicated home charger now a regular powerpoint delivers about 180 kilometers of charging overnight which is four times the daily needs of most drivers there 's no additional cost if you 've already got a power point in your in your garage although it is less convenient and can be a little bit of a safety consideration if you 've got old wiring whereas a dedicated charger will um introduce about uh daily needs of the vehicle in about one hour and overnight will charge from from flat to full it costs about one to two thousand dollars to install a charger depending on what infrastructure you have but usually a dedicated circuit such as what you would install if you 're installing an oven you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an oven it 's basically the same process to put in an electric vehicle charger that amount of capacity about a 32 amp dedicated circuit i find a dedicated charger much more convenient similar to a fuel browser you just plug in and go now if you 're interested in charging directly from solar there are two products on the market one is the solar edge inverter the other is the zappy charger both of these are able to directly put solar power into your car and only ensure that the amount of available solar is what is used to charge the vehicle something you can look into as well now if you 're interested in public charging using fast chargers such as this petrol station model here offered by chargefox all of these public charging chargefox ev networks and nrma provide electricity as fast charging but it is from 100 green power so if you charge from from these networks which is all the available public networks of fast charging available in australia today it is 100 emissions free so effectively it 's it 's it 's renewable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power i 'm just going to sum up by saying that the lessons that i 've learned from overseas is that the mature markets offer all kinds of charging now anywhere from a powerpoint to a dedicated fast charger we see different offerings around the world and by offering different models of charging everywhere it basically means the answer to where can i charge is everywhere and that means mass adoption so here is the city of oslo in norway and this is all of the fast charges available in the city and whilst that may look like pretty good coverage wait until you see what it looks like in terms of level two the kind of charging the council might put in that 's the the public charging available at uh kind of that dedicated whereas level one the sort of power points that you might have in your regular garage this is all the public power points that are available that kind of just trickle charge so by offering all three different types of charging basically it means that where can i charges everywhere now this is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in australia already so you might be surprised to see that there is actually a lot of charging available and initiatives such as offered by the new south wales government and um and councils means that this is only going to increase my own experience of driving electric vehicle is that anywhere in sydney is faster and easier than petrol pretty much anywhere i can get home to charge um is is is easy and i don 't have to go to petrol station even for five minutes anywhere on the highway to dubbo brisbane or melbourne is no stress don 't even have to um to really think about i just might want to plan my toilet stops along fast charging um stops and i have been into country new south wales and whilst it used to be really hard it 's now actually quite easy because of the nrma network and the forthcoming um other networks from chargefox and ev networks as well as the new south wales government this is the the uh targets that new south wales government are looking to to go after as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three and a half thousand dollars a year is how much i save driving electric vehicle it 's definitely quieter it 's definitely safer and it 's definitely more fun i drive with grain power so no emissions and it 's certainly nice to be able to to contribute to healthier air so in summary uh what we 've seen from the survey from council is that there has been a positive response from from people within right council to support electric vehicles and councillors responded by buying their own so this is the ionic that council have um and councils supporting this disruption as well as um generally in sustainability and the new south wales government is also supporting it so there 's a lot of momentum now happening in australia as as councils and governments are looking to support it and more and more people are buying electric vehicles so i 've seen a lot of questions of have kind of come up in the chat while i 've been talking and i 've gone a few minutes longer because because i guess i wanted to answer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what i 'd like to do now is maybe throw over to to diego to facilitate the q a and um we 'll we 'll get into the panel discussion for the next 10 minutes until um the end of the presentation diego have we got you yes i 'm here can you see me yes can see you now bryce and brent you can see you 're on the line as well excellent oh hang on i just need to make sure i stop sharing okay so we should be back into the main meeting all right what questions have we come in on the chat we 've got quite a few questions um it 's just a little bit tricky at the moment because i 'm from my using my phone what i could see is most of the questions have been addressed already uh by bryce brent and even yourself the questions that we 're not able to um answer today will be addressed via email um so i 'm sure diego if you like yep that would be great kindly thank you okay good evening everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with diego as well just to help put forward some of our questions some of you may or may not have seen them the first one that we have is from an anonymous attendee who asked how do you persuade more strata blocks to upgrade their systems and install eb charging stations okay i 'll jump in and i 'll take this one um look try and present it as moving the entire apartment block into a renewable energy future and um it 's not just about preparing for the electric vehicles it 's like there are other benefits of renewable energy instead of paying 1.33 for each cent of hot water in your block you might get that down to 13 cents for hot water you 'll reduce the the cost of electricity inside apartments and you you 're increasing the valuation of every apartment in the building so len lise did a study and if you put these new technologies into a building it loads an extra 10k of value into each property each individual apartment in the building so property valuation uplift [Music] fantastic thank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do you know if i can find out what the ev road markings are for new south wales okay would you like to throw that one over too well i 'm not exactly sure what the question 's asking into well electric vehicles just like any vehicle that 's got a steering wheel and pedals and you you drive it along the road there 's no particular requirements when you 're actually on the road as for parking uh what we 've seen is councils start to put restricted parking conditions that are only allowing electric vehicles to charge and as far as legislation point goes local governments have passed requirements specifically for electric vehicle signage around that but pretty much anyone can paint a road or a parking spot green that 's not necessarily a requirement but it is a way to advertise where charging can go but i do know that the um the the sign markings for for um restricted parking only for electric vehicles is some legislating that has been passed um gentlemen any other points of view on that question i would actually probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the legislation is to get the exact markings that are supposed to be it was quite a lot of variability in the markings and the ability to find the signs for where some of the charging gets put there 's a couple of times i 've had difficulty plugs here tell me where it is and you can 't fight sure i guess it really needs to catch up that 's really the um the the summary is that um there 's a little bit of a lag in terms of the sign markings and for specific for electric vehicles thank you for that um just a bit of a statement here kai has posted in relation to electric buses and taxi power um saying that the disadvantage of electric buses and taxi is power shortages problems caused after heavy rainfall therefore we should keep a proportion of them as an internal combustion glass do we have any comments on that i i could comment on that the event of the especially the ones in shenzhen that were shown they got quite large batteries they can run for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really an issue it 's it 's power outages would be at most for an hour or two and generally much less so much much much much less than the time that it 'll take to run them flat you and hope is asking the panel what is the average cost of using a public installed charger i might dive in uh the chargefox network at the moment charging 40 cents per kilowatt hour roughly uh ev charging a bit more for that as our new south side uh tasmania are charging for that but they 're the sort of numbers but ever do you ever um a lot of public charging is free um it 's like um if you go to mcdonald 's you can get free wi-fi you no longer have to pay for for for wi-fi it 's actually quite similar if you go to top right shopping center it 's free if you go to macquarie center it 's free if you go to chatswood westfield it 's free to charge and that 's because they want you to stay maybe a little bit longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a 10 um coffee and cake or or a 50 top so a lot of public charging is free um personally when i 'm going to um to my local stocklands in balgala i could use free charging but i actually like to park right near the front door because if i go home and charge it cost me about three dollars so um you know it 's it 's a it 's a tough decision but usually i leave it for someone who might not have access to home charging and relies on on that public charger in order to be able to charge so on a highway it might cost you 10 15 20 something like that for a full tank but public charging can any can be anywhere from from from three to that amount of money yeah i actually forgot that i was talking the dc fast charger type stuff evan 's talking about mainly the ac stuff etc slightly slower charging um also the nrma network is currently free to all users and will be remaining free to automate association members after that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association for that continued free charging for the dc 50 kilowatt charges we 've got a couple of questions on the chat in relation to will the webinar be available for replay yes it will for the next couple of weeks and diego has just put a reminder saying that any of the questions that we can 't get to today we can address via email to those participants that have already registered so thank you for that justin has asked what does maintenance for an ev look like time between services costs skills required etc i might jump in on this one because i 've looked at in a lot of detail nissan for example they have cat price servicing for their electric vehicles and for their non electric vehicles or internal combustion engine vehicles and if you just look at the cap price servicing it 's half it 's half as much for the nissan leaf compared to an equivalent passenger vehicle my own experiences has actually been been zero my my vehicle electric vehicle basically needs no routine service um it 's just if there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no oil changes there 's no brake changes nearly as often because of the way the vehicle slows down by putting energy back into the battery there 's no air filter changes other than in the passenger sell once every six years so servicing is a lot less but if you wanted to do an inspection nissan charge 200 a year cap price servicing for their electric vehicle and i 'll jump in with my experience with the kona that 's 165 dollars for 12 months or 15 000 k 's and for that you get a renewal of the annual roadside service and you get an update of the maps so just on those two alone it 's worth it 155 dollars for someone to just check and rotate the tires up there perhaps that 's pretty much what they do they just inspect the vehicle they don 't actually change in their consumables and tesla have no service schedule it 's just the car will tell someone when it needs to go in for something that needs do otherwise they have no service excellent thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she 's said if i 'm in an apartment is it possible to get this technology in my block even if everybody else isn 't on board and how do i get this started yeah so what we 've done is um we posted up uh into the chat uh a sample bylaw so the very first thing that you need to do is approach your strata committee uh say here 's a sample by law um don 't get greedy with the speed that you want um to charge if you buy a tesla you 'll get a charge point with that car and just say i 'm happy for single phase 16 amp charging nothing that 's going to put any strain on the building and if you drive 25 kilometers a day um to and from work you 'll get your charge at that speed in about three hours inside the apartment block so um uh download that sample bylaw and take it to your next agm or um strata committee meeting that 's a very good question and it 's one that we as council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to enact sustainability especially relation to solar relation to electric vehicles and and i think that 's one thing that does stop people from actually trying because they don 't think they can do it but the technolo the technology is definitely there it 's enabled both solar and dv so and i want to jump forward yeah i should just jump in and say um there 's passage through the new south wales government at the moment of the uh sustainability infrastructure amendment to the strata schemes act probably coming in around september this year and that will lower the bar from a special resolution where you need 75 at present to get these new technologies into the building down to 50 so after september this year new legislation making it easier to get that passed through strata committees fantastic liz has also put in a couple of other questions too can we expect charging infrastructure to keep up with the uptake of electric vehicles and how do we find out where ev charging stations are located well the short answer on ev charging locations is.com and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for and most of the new charges are going up there first before anything else and i was the only public question was the where the charges it really needs a federal policy to promote and support an ev transition um that the states and the council 's gonna do so much so much we need an overall general direction from the federal level and that 's just not happening so they may or may not keep up in australia we 're so slow adopting them at the moment they 're comfortably keeping up what you have to remember is that 70 of charging happens at home so that 70 of you drivers will be out of charge at home if you have somewhere to charge at home uh even if you live in a unit block like me i have charging at home um you pretty much don 't need public fast charging uh at all other than if you 're maybe driving a long distance to melbourne and what we 've seen from the new south wales government well and certainly in new south wales that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's that 's probably ahead of the curve um and is is a of priority so i expect that on the major routes it 'll be okay um if you 're going to broken hill it might be a little bit harder um and we might see a little bit of lag out until there 's a national framework across those sort of distances um and also another question from one of our counselors within the city was asking when i look up the fuel watch app from the new south wales government it shows no charging stations in ride how do we change this just following on from what bryce was saying even if you don 't have the plug share app you can actually get on google maps and you can type in the words electric vehicle and it will show you all the charging locations uh what they are how many there are and if they 're free or they 're charged that 's another reason so you can use as well so over to the fuel watch app i think bryce you responded to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel watch app from the new south wales government it isn 't showing charging stations in ryden how do we change this and you put in there all right yeah there 's the answer bitter i didn 't miss that tab so i 'm just trying to find my answer um what was the question i have to i can 't quite remember ah that doesn 't show any um locations in ride under the fuel watch app and how do we change this uh as i said the plug share is the best way to find them i don 't know the fuel watch app okay yeah and the same counselor has just asked will the council policy change that comes to council later in the year also have targets to transition the percentage of fleet from combustible to ev um i can probably respond to that we 've been working in this space to assist council towards transitioning to lowered emissions vehicles for approximately two years i 'm sure um the panelists here can assist me when i say as far as fleet goes it 's a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits tax that is associated with it and although that would like to transition to a hundred percent straight away would be the short answer there 's a little bit more complexity around that which does unfortunately um inhibit that transition so we are looking at that um and it is a priority for council to be able to lead the way in that space and we 've done that the introduction of two of them in this year and we 'll be aiming to increase that and we 've just recently released our new fleet guide and list and we 've been able to increase that significantly at least with hybrid and petrol ev and the inclusion of one ebay as well hope that helps i found the comment on the field watch out for whether there are no charges in right rather than getting fuel watch updated if you haven 't got any charges in your local area it 's partly lobby the local council and that 's probably i suggest joining us tonight your legal association either that i 've mentioned earlier because we have people you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically hand to you to get sent to your local council in support and with our sort of support with that and you can also get local members to write in so if you 've got people with evs the more people saying to the council we need charging um that will happen but again as as evan said the majority of charging is done at home but it is nice to have safety community centers or your libraries an ac charger just available for that occasional top up okay i think we 're just about out of time so i might hand over to diego and thank you all that 's right um yeah we just went seven minutes over time it only shows that um this is a really interesting and evolving space uh i guess it 's safe to say that um we 're all learning as we quickly move into the ev space one of the main takeaways from today might be that it 's just a matter of time before ev 's become mainstream uh and as well it 's not that hard as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um including charging solutions but anyways i 'm not gonna extend even anymore um we 're ending the webinar now and on behalf of uh council i would like to thank all the participants including the speakers um we hope to uh touch base with you soon uh i guess i believe it 's been a very informative session and i hope you all enjoyed uh this will certainly inspire us to run similar events in the near future have a good uh have a good evening everyone i 'd say well done thanks diego"

    "text": "now before we begin i 'll start by introducing myself my name 's catherine blizzard i 've been a business advisor for the last six years but i 've owned cafes for the last 30 years you could say hospitality is in my blood now my my superpower is actually building local favorites and also building cafes into million dollar assets that 's what i 'm best at so understanding your numbers let 's start with some really interesting facts did you know actually that 75 of the australian population drink coffee of the 75 35 actually make their coffee from home that leaves 40 percent of the australian population who drink coffee that 's 7 million kilograms a year of coffee and of the 40 percent who do buy their coffee 23 just over half are buying takeaway coffee and they 're paying by card so 65 of people are paying by card so if you 're if you don 't have fps facilities you 're actually missing out on a lot of money another thing that we do is we often sell combos breakfast combos and we sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll but in fact most people prefer strong coffee in the morning they prefer a strong coffee and it 's a great opportunity to upsell even on that when they do ask for that combo oh would you like a strong coffee with that that 's an extra 50 cents for you and it all adds up at the end of the year but interestingly 95 of all cafes are independently owned and however as owners with best practice in our cafes we 're earning 10 profit from from our cafes 10 profit before tax is what the average cafe owner earns a lot of cafe owners at the moment they 're paying to go to work and what is pain to go to work with look like well it 's when we 're propping up cash flow with our personal cash and credit cards when we 're really dreading the wages each week because we don 't know what will be left over when we 're struggling with work life balance we 're working long hours for very little return we 're unable to pay our our ato requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about inconsistent sales and the list goes on and one thing that we all do is that we are totally preoccupied with cutting costs what when we 're paying to go to work what this actually means is that we 're in a startup phase it 's a very natural phase for business to feel like this at startup it 's some businesses are what we call in a startup phase for just six to 12 months but other businesses stay in this startup phase for years and it 's actually working towards getting out of that startup phase into a phase that 's called return on investment so we need to move out and hopefully today i can help you with moving out of that startup phase and into the return on investment phase but there 's a silver lining because when you are struggling like that when you are paying to go to work you 're running a lean ship and there 's nothing wrong with that you 're cutting a lot of costs but the biggest problem is that cafe owners feel comfortable in two areas they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of house where they 're serving customers and what often happens is they spend all their time in those areas failing to take time out to actually work on the business because to work on the business takes a lot of time it 's not easy but once it 's done it 's only done once you get into that habit and it 's life changing because it starts to make you money now the what uh the a successful business a cafe owner is focused on the numbers they know their numbers but that 's a very small portion of cafe owners who know their numbers a lot of my clients will say to me catherine i 'm not i 'm not good at the numbers you know it 's not my thing well it was never my thing either i dropped i dropped maths when i was 16 years old i didn 't even do maths when i was in years 11 and 12. maths was a weakness i was in a class called maths in space i was a space cadet i was so weak with numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what i had to do in business and there are numbers you need to know you need to know how much do you need to sell so that you cover your costs you need to know what are the profits in what you 're selling and you need to know what your overheads are and how you 're managing those costs because they are they can they can really impact on your bottom line now there are three little steps that you can do to understanding your numbers and their crucial steps if you 're not good with your numbers the best investment you will make is finding a bookkeeper because a bookkeeper will give you the information you need to stay on top of those numbers the bookkeeper will do a number of things for you so the bookkeeper will help you understand where you are now what are your sales now and how what is the shortfall the bookkeeper will set you up with an annual budget so the bookkeeper will tell you exactly how much you can spend with your current sales and give you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking even and covering all your costs a bookkeeper will also prepare profit and loss reports one of the biggest mistakes cafe owners make is they rely on the accountant to do the profit and loss reports at the end of the year that 's too late 12 months of being behind with bass p-a-y-g super it 's too late because you 're going to incur such a great debt you need weekly or fortnightly profit and loss reports because you need to understand your percentages now explain what percentages are in the next slide you need to be paying your super monthly and you and the bookkeeper will help you and register you for monthly payg what this does is alleviates cash flow issues so you 're paying little chunks at a time rather than big chunks every quarter or every year so it 's important to get yourself set up with a bookkeeper and to do this as a matter of urgency if you are propping up your business with your own money if you are struggling to make ends meet so let 's look at what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cafe on the left we have a profit and loss statement it 's an it 's a sample and on the right is what i talk about when i say percentages now a profit and loss doesn 't look this small in a cafe we 've always got a profit and loss that gives us our sales it gives us our cost of goods our cost of goods is the food all the ingredients and drinks we buy to produce the items on our menu now on the far right column of the profit and loss statement is percentage of sales so you can see in this example in the red circle the cost of goods here is sitting at 36 of sales so this person is cost they have to they 're spending 36 of their revenue on food on ingredients to make their sales that 's a high number you don 't want to be at 36 percent and that once you take the sales you remove the cost of goods you get the gross profit in this example it 's 45 sixty four dollars wages here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sales which is a very good number and there are other expenses they 've actually split rent with other but an accountant or bookkeeper today will put the rent into the other expenses and they 're sitting at 18 12 percent for rent six percent for other expenses so this person here has 36 of sales they spend on the cost of goods they spend 26 of that 70 202 in sales on wages and 18 in other costs now if we look at the right hand box the blue one the cost of goods sold a typical range in a cafe today is between 28 to 36 percent now the 28 percent is really um more franchises who have that low number because they have a lot of buying power and they do buy their ingredients at a lower price and 36 is a really high end for a cafe and that would immediately tell me if i was looking at their p l 's that they 're either paying too much for their stock their pricing is too low or they 're wasting a lot of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice is 30 that 's where your cost of goods needs to be your labor costs including super needs to be at 30 of sales and your other costs now your other costs are huge right i 've actually created a little list rent insurances car leases electricity gas telephone internet accounting bank fees the replacement of crockery and cutlery equipment maintenance the list of expenses is huge and it mustn 't go beyond 30 now a profit and loss statement if you get one tomorrow you and look at your percentages you will immediately see where you 're going wrong especially if you 're exceeding those 30 marks because the higher they are the less profit you earn and i hope that makes sense now the the problem is in cafes and restaurants is that people are relying owners are relying on gut instinct rather than facts the profit and loss statements give us cold hard facts and every week a profit and loss statement will help you get back on track in fact i always had mine in the back of my pocket every week to see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs if i could save 30 minutes a week on labor well that 's 20 for me or whatever it was fifteen dollars depended on the number of staff so there are ways in which you can reduce your costs to maximize your profit and the bookkeeper is the one who can do this for you regularly because your accountant is someone that you only need to meet once a year now with understanding your numbers number one of course is get yourself the bookkeeper number or a great accounting software package if you are really good with the numbers step two is to open a separate bank account i used to call this bank account not my money bank account because in this bank account every week every day in fact i 'd arrange a direct debit from my working account into this other account a direct debit of money that actually wasn 't mine because bass p-a-y-g and super is not our money it belongs to the government so why are we spending it throw it into that other account and you will probably find that you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your obligations in your business as well and the reason i did this on a daily basis was because my turnover was different every day on a monday it could be three thousand dollars but on a saturday it could be ten thousand dollars so what i all arranged for direct debits was using that historical information through my point of sale and assistance with my bookkeeper to determine how much money i should be arranging for that direct debit each day of the week and the last thing that you could do is contact your sales reps this is interesting and this can save you thousands of dollars a year you 'll be surprised how they can work with you when you start talking about setting up a 12 month fixed pricing contract so fixed pricing is crucial think of all the milk the bread the dry goods we buy or the the chickens the meat so you can arrange with these suppliers by speaking with them and saying i want a fixed price for 12 months on these ingredients and i will stay with you and not buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do cost your food that you are making the profits that you 've planned to make because you know nothing all of your ingredients are at that same price because the sense that these suppliers add to our stock each week we don 't even notice but they all add up and it 's very hard to notice when you 're busy how much they 're increasing different products each week or even each month now once you know you know your numbers you know you 've got a budget you know where you 're at you 've already got clarity you already feel comfortable you may feel uncomfortable because what your accountant is or your bookkeeper has told you is that actually your revenue is not meeting costs so you need to do something about that but at least you know what that number is and at least you know how much revenue you need to get to achieve that break even point and the revenue you need to get to go beyond that so you 're making profit the other thing you need to do is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to build a million dollar cafe your rent needs to be five percent of your revenue that 's the goal if your rent is a hundred thousand dollars your revenue need target needs to be two million dollars per year that 's if you want to build that million dollar cafe that is great practice five percent of revenue the rent to be because 2 million is about 40 000 a week so it 's a big revenue target but if you 're happy with a nice wage and it 's a job and you you want a comfortable lifestyle then rent at 10 of revenue is best practice so how far are you from that think about your rent today and it has to be 10 of your revenue so where are you now and where do you need to go to and that may well be your sales goal or target that you aim for now how do we make these sales you know a lot of people say to me catherine my revenue is 400 000 a year and i need to get to one million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way yes i agree but at least you 've got four hundred thousand so we 're part way there we 're almost halfway there the sort of things that worked for me is loyalty programs not a lot only one program but they need a strategy if you implement a loyalty program buy nine copies and get the 10 free then you remind your customers hey have you got your card with you or have you tapped into the screen remind the customers of the loyalty program so they 're using it and when they do get that free copy they actually get very excited if new customers are coming in hey you 've been in twice would you like to have a loyalty card it will save you money who doesn 't want that so it 's a very great way to increase sales and i guess to retain customers and add some extras you need to be doing social media every day every day you need to be top of mind want your customer when they 're thinking of coffee you want them to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of you because they see you every day online claim your business on google reviews really work there 's a great uh city of bride webinar on this so go to their website and take a look i used to actually create a monthly newsletter i 'd get an a4 piece of paper a4 fold it and i 'd print a newsletter the newsletter would sit by my coffee station so when people waiting for coffee they could read it and the newsletter was very simple didn 't have a lot it would include i 'd have a quote i 'd have a recipe that the chef would put together we used to have very creative stuff one of them was a movie buff and he 'd talk right about his favorite movie and you know why everybody should watch it we 'd introduce new staff in the newsletter we 'd tell people about staff who were leaving staff who were going on holidays and where they were going things new things on the menu specials that were coming up it was a great way to build familiarity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite is all about familiarity and the newsletter is free it takes you one hour to put together and it 's something that sits there and is great for your branding and for your community other things you could do here is things to consider online ordering apps hey you for example and online reservations customers like to visit their cafe or might want to visit your cafe but want the assurance that they 've got a table so online reservations can be quite good as well for increasing sales but these activities here quite frankly are more branding activities i do feel that they added some value and they did actually work but what really worked was upselling that 's what really worked that 's what added thousands of dollars to my revenue each each year the upselling there are two types there 's upselling where you have to train your staff and there 's upselling where you don 't need to train your staff so let 's look at training your staff and what that upselling looks like because you know mcdonald 's when they implemented would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that and when to say that so what we did and what i do with my venues is i organize menu tasting evenings for the staff twice a year and this gives them the opportunity to taste all the food on our menu they rate it we talk about it we talk about optional sides because upselling is not just about us uh yeah making all that money but it 's also about enhancing customer experience the customer will be really happy if you suggest the side that they may enjoy with that meal so menu tasting is really important for teams in cafes because when staff do recommend things to customers it actually comes from a genuine aspect it 's not fake it 's not something they 've been taught to do they tried the food they know what it tastes like and they can make really great suggestions that will work for us as business owners the other thing of course that we train staff is how to sell coffee and drinks customers remember the first and last thing you say to them and they particularly remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two sizes of coffee would you like a regular or large but if you have three sizes you would say would you like a medium regular or large you put the cheapest option in the middle because it 's the one option that they will remember the least you want them to order the larger of the coffees the water is the same would you like steel tap or sparkling the cheapest in the middle the most expensive been the last because that 's what customers remember and one of the biggest things you need to train your staff to do is when they 're walking around your cafe especially if you have dine-in service they they ask their customers would you like another coffee i have two examples one 's a good one and one 's a bad one and let 's call these case studies i was in broad beach last week and i walked into a cafe my daughter and i ordered the cheeseburger combo the girl at the till asked us if we would like aioli or sauce without chips we were excited of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like tomato sauce that 's an extra two dollars so if that venue made twelve dollars in that day from those sources that 's four thousand dollars extra per year for their revenue just by asking that simple question on a two dollar sale so imagine what it would be like if your staff were doing this for coffee as well would you like an extra coffee or giving them suggestions for other options the the bad case study here was one i went to in cronulla it was a beautiful cafe very modern me and three girlfriends went we sat down we ordered we ordered food and cocktails we were there for 90 minutes in those 90 minutes they cleared our table there were that many staff yet no one approached us to ask us whether we wanted an extra drink whether we wanted an extra coffee or even dessert they totally ignored us i actually had to wave my hand to get their attention so that we can pay the bill so that 's a really bad example on a number of different levels because what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even implement key performance indicators the first kpi that they should have implemented is employee revenue you 've got that many employees it 's table service are you monitoring how much each of your employees is earning for you they didn 't have that because if they did i would definitely have had someone approach me to ask me if i want a dessert or an other another drink the other thing they have failed is they have failed to understand an efficient business they were very inefficient when we have tables we want them to turn regularly we want people to leave and more people to come and giving the customers the bill is very important and being and communicating with that customer is crucial this cafe didn 't do any of that so i would guess that they 're struggling now there 's upselling that you can do that 's requires as i said no stuff training the baker 's delight method add some food samples to the front of your point of sale where they 're ordering with some toothpicks let them taste some of the goodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale people love that it makes them buy and that 's what you want you want to increase sale have you taken advantage of the dine and discover new south wales vouchers the city of ride 100 000 people who are eligible for these vouchers 100 000 people in your lga have 50 dollars worth of dine and discover food vouchers that 's five million dollars in your lga have you registered as a cafe business because you 're missing out if you haven 't how about creating combos and promoting the fact that you do you are participating in the dine and discover new south wales program it 's a huge opportunity to increase those sales and of course finally clever menu design now clever menu design is crucial to making money believe it or not eighty percent of cafes do not cost the food that they are selling they 're basing their prices on competition and that 's really dangerous because if we compete on price we do die we need to add value and think about value that 's what the customer wants they don 't actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food is consistently fresh and delicious if the venue looks amazing they will pay they don 't care about the price so but venues are not costing the menu so to make money from your main source the menu you need to understand how much every item is costing you to make so the first step you need to do in this area to we 're still on upselling right but we 're talking about what you 're going to do before you start up selling this menu is you need to cost every single one of those items on your menu so you need to understand ingredient wise how much each of those things cost you in ingredients then and you may not have to you may not be able to do this alone you may have to do this with the help of one of your staff because it is a big task the second thing you need to do is print off a point of sale report that lists every single item on the menu from most popular to least popular so you need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much each of these items are costing you you know how much you 're selling them for and you know how popular or not popular they are so what you do then is you create four columns one will be the stars labeled stars the second will be plow horses the third will be puzzles and the fourth will be dogs so using the information you have you will put each item on your menu in the appropriate column because you have just identified the stars you know the things on your menu that have high profit and are really popular but you also know the items that are low profit and load no popular not popular so this is a crucial exercise because this is magic for profit and sales in your business now the puzzles are interesting you 've got this menu item it 's got high profit but no one likes it so when you do that menu tasting with your staff and you should do that after you 've done this exercise is you can talk to your staff raise it in a meeting say hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you suggest what can you suggest we do and you 'd be amazed what your staff can actually say to you because they 're the ones talking to the customers and the plow horses the low profit that are very popular we don 't want many of those on our menu they do bring customers in but we need to think about what can we add to these what can we suggest to customers that will increase the profit like a side what side would work really well with these that we can upsell on to improve the profitability so once you have this information again you 're very clear you know exactly which item on your menu is making you money and which item is not and of course at the end of the day do you want the dogs do you want items on your menu that don 't make you any money and no one likes we call this flogging a dead horse but what it allows you to do is create a menu design that will make people buy more and what does that look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you know the stars on your menu you know the ones with a high profit do something with them put them in a box put a little asterisk next to it you know how many restaurants do i go to where they have a page on chef 's selections well those chef 's selections are the high profit margin dishes in your cafe think about each of your categories you might have breakfast sandwiches burgers how many categories do you have desserts so each category you should identify the stars and highlight them now you can 't really highlight too many in fact with this sort of exercise i wouldn 't be highlighting more than one you can add a photo that 's good but you can 't add too many photos so you can add a photo for every category on your menu or you can box something that 's really high profit and really popular because that 's what you want people to buy the things with high profit the other thing you should be doing on your menu is don 't have a list of prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bad practice why because the customer looks at that and really makes a decision in this situation and they do can sometimes base it on price you do not want your customer basing their selection on price you want them basing their selection on what they like the most so best practice is where the tick is put the price at the end of the description and remove the dollar sign because the dollar sign reminds them of money and we don 't want them to be reminded of money now other little things that you can do of course you 're going to describe your menu items but you know use evocative text crispy cucumber crunchy cucumber crispy lettuce juicy tomato that 's evocative description for your menu mcdonald 's gets away with it they just they can put lettuce onion and so forth they don 't need that because their whole way of selling the menu is through images and they do that very cleverly but we as cafe operators don 't have the budgets of mcdonald 's so we 've got to use our own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will make customers want to buy it and mention brand names if you 're using lint chocolate for your hot chocolate mention that if you 're using pepsia butter mention that mention brand names humanize your menu mama effie 's rice pudding if you 've got something that was your childhood favorite cake angela 's childhood favorite caramel slice so humanize it as well cavities do really well with that but the yellow section here is really crucial remember that the way you list your menu items is really important when people look at a menu they often choose the things on the top of the menu or off top of that category or right at the bottom of the category so this is the psychology of how we look at things and so when because you know your high profit items and if there are those dogs on the menu that you want to keep because a couple of customers really love them then all your popular items for each category need to go to the top of the category so for example burgers you will have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other high profit burger right at the bottom the last item of that list the dog the burger with the least profit will go just above the last item on that category i hope that makes sense because the item that people rarely choose is the second one from the bottom of each category so keep that in mind because if you want people buying items with the most profit that 's what you need to do with your menu you want people buying those items you don 't want them buying things with no profit of course the last thing is how many pages do you have on your menu a single page has the least sales because people look at that list they 're either looking at the top where most cafes list their toast their scrambled eggs all their cheap items and then they 're looking at the bottom which are the drinks and a coffee so what did cafes sell toast scrambled eggs and coffee the best type of menu is a two panel menu a two panel menu is say an a3 size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually um look at it and they feel like they 're getting a full dining experience and that 's the difference because if people feel like they 're getting a full dining experience they 're going to order more from your menu and that 's how we increase our sales now the one last thing i will mention about clever menu design is that you shouldn 't really exceed seven items per category seven sandwiches seven burgers seven breakfast items you know already we 're at 21 items maybe you 've got a dessert menu maybe you 've got share plates so you already that that menu looks pretty heavy but if you 've got pages and pages of menu you need to really think about that carefully i went to an italian restaurant in parramatta about a year ago and that 's what i was given i was given a book full of pictures and and a whole lot of items and at the end i ordered a veal scallopini now that veal scallopini came to me with a side of bok choy now why did it come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes on that menu that they probably ran out of broccolini and ended up putting a chinese ingredient or an asian ingredient into an italian dish it didn 't work it actually didn 't taste good so these are the risks you take by having huge menus you 've got more training you 've got to buy more stock there 's more food preparation and there 's a higher risk of inconsistency by doing the exercise and identifying what people really love work on that menu to determine what you 'll actually keep and what you can actually throw out if you 've got a menu that 's too long so some interesting information you 've got my number and you 've got my email on the screen so please don 't hesitate to contact me"

by melanie athen hi everyone my name is mel i 'm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be celebrating some of the best native and habitat-friendly gardens in the ride area which is really exciting for me native plants are super super important to me and to our ecosystem and they 're really enriching to the garden native plants are obviously really striking in their flowers and their foliage they come in all different shapes and sizes you have things like your kangaroo paw here which is really structural and gives a brilliant colour pop they 're also great for pots so if you don 't have a lot of room these are the guys for you and things like lamandra which are just a classic but they come in so many different forms and are super fine or super thick in their foliage so really great options for smaller spaces too native plants also provide a huge range of habitat and food for our native wildlife and key pollinators so things like birds and bees they love to get stuck into your bottle brushes here which have a lovely a red flower and our gravillas which are super nectar rich so lots of food for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you can keep them lower so really versatile also it 's important to provide homes for all sizes of pollinators and animals so providing larger things like this is great but also having lower growing ground covers are important as well for smaller things to hide in so your chrysocephalum here which is this beautiful ground cover with these little button-like flowers and a silver foliage so great contrast and scavola which is a fantastic coastal succulent ground cover just a huge carpet of flowers so really great these are all drought tolerant low maintenance made for the australian landscape and this will really help reduce our footprint and our water usage

members together to share their expert knowledge in the interest of helping each other to learn and grow to their highest potential so before we get started i 'm just going to run through some quick housekeeping points uh so let us know if you 're having any audio or video issues in the chat box ask us any questions um at any time sorry uh you can use the chat box to ask these questions and we will be having a q a um at the end of the session uh and this session is being recorded and you will be able to find a uh the recording of our at the uh city of ride uh website and this webinar today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by new south wales treasury for the small business month so now without further ado i 'd like to introduce today 's presenter realized business advisor and marketing expert sarah berry thank you courtney good morning everybody well welcome to today 's webinar why you need an organic social media strategy for your brand and i do like my workshops to be interactive so please um make sure you shoot any questions that you have into your chat box there okay so as courtney just ran through realize business is a not-for-profit um and this webinar was brought to you today through the city of ride and small business month so my name is sarah berry as mentioned i am a realized business advisor and coach and marketing strategist i work as a sounding board and accountability partner for many of my clients and my goal is to teach you how to sharpen your strategy tighten your focus increase your reach and grow your business the most important thing i work to deliver with my clients is a strong make marketing capability not marketing dependency and by that i mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are confident and understand how to deliver marketing in your own business to reach your goals and flourish so i 'm a marketing professional with three decades of experience across a number of industries including hospitality retail and professional services i am the owner of marketing sense um celebrated my eighth year in business this year and a specialist in transforming and building brands during a period of transformation and disruption so specifically i 'm experienced in working with small businesses um to identify ways in which their business can cost effectively grow their brand and increase their relevance to the customer and sustainably grow their business so the aim of today is to really take you through um social media now most of us are aware that social media are rapidly becoming pay to play and in order to reach your audience you need to pay but today i 'm going to unearth a few tips and tricks on how to use your social media through unpaid also known as organic social media strategies so having a social media presence for your business is vital for building your brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one hour webinar i would like to show you how to improve your unpaid social media reach and engagement and how to create an organic social strategy in a pay-to-play world so starting off first it 's really important to point out that social media is part of the digital marketing mix not all of it it 's part of it and within that we 've got a nice little acronym here peso paid earned shared spray paid earned shared and owned and here 's a little framework that i put together so here you can see um four quadrants with earned paid owned and shared in each quadrant so the purpose of your digital marketing strategy is to have a mix of each of those so each of these enable your prospects and your clients to get to know like and trust you so the basic idea is that some channels your website and social media platforms coupled with different content content types assist in the customer 's journey where they come to know you like you and trust you so at each stage in the price process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business you are building brand awareness customer relationships clarity on your service offerings credibility with your client visibility engagement and long-term organic seo so that you are found on google so i 'm just going to skim through today oh sorry i 'll do it i 've skipped forward a slide and i 'll probably mess up by going backwards so i 'm just going to stick on this one now so the first part of this is paid so paid media is the media that you pay for like google adwords facebook advertising paypal pay-per-click or any other types of search or display advertising so when you use paid you need to have clear calls to action and the use of keywords and content needs to address the platforms or solutions that your potential customer is looking for so the clear advantage of using paid advertising online is targeting capability so facebook and google have access to a great deal of data on behavior that you can leverage from when you 're looking to target your customer so you can also use the data to understand your advertising with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly facebook and google can provide access to powerful resources that help you to make insightful business decisions okay so then moving on to earned so earned media is basically online pr and media relations so if owned media sites are the destination then earned media is a vehicle that helps people get there so um what good is a website for example or social media if no one is seeing or interacting with it so that 's where earned media comes in earned media is essentially online word of mouth usually seen in the form of mentions shared reposts reviews recommendations or any other content that is picked up by third-party sites so on to owned so owned media is the most important in your digital marketing strategy and is the center of all things digital engagement as your website so it is your content hub and where you provide all the answers to your clients on their decision making journey so the more owned media you have um so in essence the more content you have the greater your digital presence is so in this instance your content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which improves your ranking so especially when you 're looking at using relevant keywords so your website is your opportunity to share everything you have identified through the marketing process what makes your organization different um clarify your services address the client 's pain points and how the clients will life will be improved through the use of your service should all be explained through your website and your blog content which is your owned media and onto the final your share and this is obviously the main focus i wanted to take you through the other parts of peso today so that you had an understanding of the context but shared media is where we 're going to be spending the time this morning in unpacking uh social media and word of mouth referrals so shared media primarily encompasses using social media your social media to distribute your content um including um basically it helps your audience and guides them back to your site which is why i talked about owned having a website um is the goal using shared media gets these prospects and clients to your website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh that the wonderful free lunch that was social media is long gone and largely these days to be seen on facebook you do need to look at ways to prime the algorithm so this does mean there is a lot of effort needed on posting super engaging content um that uh really go about building your brand and your brand story um as a priority to your actual spell um so for those of you that are sitting out there today talking about how the fact that you 're getting very little um interactions engagement on your uh social media um don 't be disappointed as i said facebook is now and a lot of the platforms not just facebook uh are now becoming paid to play but that doesn 't mean that you don 't use your social media um to show the personality and the personal side of your business so posting on facebook as i mentioned also helps with your seo and helps your customers move through their decision making process um so you 're using social media with the goal of building your business 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your social presence um with the idea of getting more eyes on your content which will then bring them back to your website so there are a number of um social media platforms today as you know with that uh without wasting too much time going through them all in detail um we have facebook instagram youtube pinterest linkedin twitter snapchat and tick tock um i 'm not going to cover all of these today that is something obviously that you would need to look at in a one-on-one session but i 'm going to go through some of the more popular ones and really unpack um some of the tips and tricks around how to get engagement on your social media so one of the things that you need to be aware of is that facebook according to the yellow social media report of 2020 is the most popular platform followed now by youtube watched by over 54 of australians i do think that this is going to increase quite a lot um when this report comes out next year um given the amount of time that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is definitely going to have seen an increase um in in uh use but what we do most importantly have to remember um and i 'm sitting in the corner of this so it 's not a very good place to have it so um number one here reason for using social media is to catch up with friends and family and that 's sitting at 83 um so think about why you yourself use social media for both men and women really is a way of um keeping in touch second um on quite with quite a low uh i think a decrease in percentage is uh sharing photos or videos at 39 and when it comes to sharing on social media women are more likely to post photos or videos than men the other popular reasons for people using social media is to watch videos um finding or connecting with people who have similar interests is at 31 and catching up on news and current affairs is up 30 what 's important to understand here is if we scroll all the way down almost to the bottom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage with brands so that 's why it 's really important to understand where social media fits in in your overall sales and marketing strategy so when you 're busy running your business it 's impossible um to find time to be active on every social media and i went through the list and you know there 's quite a long list and also also multiple ways um of sharing on those platforms as well now so it is overwhelming i will admit um so narrowing down your choice to just a few platforms will really allow you to focus your efforts and get the best return on your time investment and really there are a number of ways of doing this um in a smart way which i 'm going to unpack today and that is um identifying your target market understanding their needs and then you 're able to really um pick the best platform for you so for today i 've created a nice little framework for you um feel free to take a screenshot so this is really the social media funnel that i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through and unpacking today but if you just have a little photograph of this in your mind and try and remember when you 're doing your content it 's important to get a nice mixture of content across each phase of this funnel and really understand each part of this funnel and how it works in your business so we have at the top of the funnel awareness so here you really need to grab the attention of your audience and create a strong first impression so the goal here is to get attention grab your audience so you know really the best way to do this is to know your ideal client so that your content is relevant and resonates next down in the funnel is engagement so the prospect is now aware of your brand and the next phase is nurturing them and engaging them and trying to be memorable so um you know we live in a sea of likeness and what you need to do here is um make your customers remember you next phase down and the most crucial crucial stage for all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business strategy is the acquisition phase so here um as a marketer it falls on you to nudge your prospective customers to really take action so this is where you need to think about the whole strategy and in particular your website so what is um what is an acquisition what does an acquisition strategy or uh action actually mean to you in a business it could be um take the form of signing up to a newsletter a free trial um downloading a brochure or making a purchase um and to actually understand this a little bit more in detail i have created a blog which is available on my website um all about uh product ladders um so again that 's one of those things that we can talk about in more detail in a one-on-one session or feel free to head over to my website and take a look at that blog about product ladders in order to get a better understanding of the type of um acquisition techniques you can use next step down oh and actually also not to forget within acquisition um for facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retargeting you should make sure that you have the facebook pixel installed on your website so that you can retarget using um facebook or instagram so the next one down is loyalty so once a customer has purchased you need to work really really hard to retain them the reason being is it 's actually three to ten times less um in terms of cost than acquiring a new one to keep them loyal so once a customer has made a purchase from you is the time that you really need to step up your marketing efforts to make them a regular and one really good way of doing this is to use your social media to provide really amazing customer service and to show your client love and finally last but not least this is actually my favorite part of the funnel is advocacy so this is where you turn your loyal customers into your advocates we all know right that people trust a brand recommended by their friends and family and this part of the funnel is really coming into play more and more and something i will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of belonging to foster an emotional connection with your brand okay so let 's have a little uh look more at awareness so i mentioned the most important part of uh getting awareness is to produce content that is relevant and engaging so the goal here is to really see things from your customers perspective one of the things i see day in day out working as a coach um and as a marketing advisor is people tend to think about their communication in a very internal way you need to really think about what it is that your business offers to your client and really try and get inside their heads um spend a day in the life of your customer and this is an exercise that i do with my customers all the time really get to know who they are the psychographics and the demographics of their behavior um so understanding goals challenges frustrations and how your product or service helps your client is paramount cannot stress that more and those of you that know me and have worked with me before know that i love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now also use another technique called jobs to be done um but basically this really is the place where you need to do the homework um this is something i still do myself in my own business i have two white boards one here and one affordable one down here and i use them all the time to reshape and reconfigure who my client is and this is really knowing the mind of your customer and spending some time understanding their challenges what you hear might hear them stay in relation to their frustrations and how you might overcome some and help them um achieve some of their challenges so let 's have a look at some good examples of how to create awareness so this is an ad from worldwide breast cancer and you can see here this is something that is going to immediately stop you in the fiend um it 's colorful um it 's actually a little bit left to center you know why are there lemons uh in an egg carton um and so straight away this is grabbing the audience 's attention so breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they use this awareness campaign know your lemons really as a way to encourage women to check the signs of breast cancer and you can see from this it 's really tongue in cheek um they also at the bottom you can see where is the hashtag somewhere on there may not be on there and they use that to your hashtag called know your lemons and created a platform where survivors were telling their story um and also you know you can see by the use of the lemons um it 's just a very tongue-in-cheek way of dealing with a very serious subject matter so what can you learn from this um that even the most difficult of topics can be made visual and engaging um using the lemon imagery was done so that the symptoms and signs of breast cancer could be quickly identified by users meaning they could catch the eye of the scrolling generation and even those like myself with uh poor eyesight okay moving on to another example um innocent juices a favorite of mine again people that work with me out these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i do like to um highlight they do some great work um and this was an instagram post where over 3 000 people took comments um and what innocent did was basically um created this campaign around saying that the drink was blue like this is really simple stuff here um it 's tasty it 's blue it 's good for you and it 's blue um and then what started was um a whole people jumping on the post to actually say hey it 's it 's not actually um blue it 's in fact green um and later on i don 't know i actually saw some of these there was a boy band around the time um actually called blue and um they used the singer from the boy band to appear in their video asserting that the drink was actually um blue so again quite simple but uh managed to encourage a lot of awareness and engagement another one of my favorites although i 'm not a huge fan um of starbucks this was one that caught my eye and i can 't remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the summer before and mainly because this is um the their unicorn frappuccino campaign and you can see immediately how this would get awareness um on someone scrolling on facebook um beautiful bright colors and i 'm really intriguing um so the um this really was um i remember my daughter at the time being into unicorns and i as i said i 'm not a huge fan of starbucks and i actually messaged the page to say hey you know where can we get this um we don 't have a local uh starbucks are they doing this in sydney and actually turned out this was only something that they were doing in america at the time um so the whole feed for a week was basically taken over by the bright colors glitter and all things unicorns which at the time was you know the the thing of the thing of the year um so the campaign was hugely successful and generated more than 155 000 posts from customers um who are just wanting to go out and try the frappuccino so this actually is an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember probably going about five or six years ago and there 's another one i use when i 'm doing these types of webinars was the freak shakes there was a business in canberra developed these weird looking freak shakes some of you may remember um so they 're a great way of really getting some good engagement awareness and interaction uh from your followers um so next here i 've actually just highlighted a couple of video platforms but the point to make here is at an awareness level the social media algorithm on all platforms right now loves video both long form and short form videos are the most shared content on social media unbelievably um one thousand two hundred more percent more shares than text and image updates and this is one of those things that i talk about a lot now in my one-on-one coaching is you know how can you quickly create video um here i 'm sharing a couple of platforms one is way video and the other is vitable i 've actually created videos myself quickly cost effectively and efficiently using the biteable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ australian startup and the other one that you can see there on the left is the wave video platform which is an online video editor and creator so you know the cost of creating videos um is certainly within the reach of most small business owners today so i urge you to get on there and make some videos um now i had actually organized for this um to play live i realized i 'm going to have to come in and out to show you uh but basically what i wanted to talk about here was instagram reels anyone using reels yet hands up um so like i mentioned you know there are endless um platforms and endless ways of using them instagram stories reels um you can now share tick tocks to reels that 's the latest thing to do but basically instagram reels allow you to create short videos via the stories feature so if you 're on instagram go up to stories and then you can record a real from there this actually only launched a couple of months ago and is the latest thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the app ideally i think that it 's 15 seconds long not long at all is the maximum and then you share it to your feed reels are um i 'm not like stories that stories disappear reals actually stay so they 're evergreen content and the idea is to really just communicate one key idea or message um okay so you 're wondering why bother um the reason i would strongly recommend that you jump onto reels is because they are great right now for reach and uh discovery um so they 're an opportunity to be seen um and also to find a new um audience and the reason for this is because they are currently being shared to the instagram explore page which is something that you 'll be familiar with that 's where all the reels and videos all come up so what this means is that it 's actually really good for getting new followers because right now the algorithm is favoring wheels i 'm going to keep moving rather than show you this one um but this was just a cute like i said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly a solopreneur and she basically was jumping in and out of different business outfits uh taking on different roles within the business so it was a really um quick and easy way of getting awareness um okay so another way to get uh really good awareness is through a live video on facebook um so this is just a really nice screenshot of me in my own uh facebook group making sense of marketing um the the reason um we would do lives at the moment is because like facebook reels this is a platform which is really rewarded by the algorithms you actually do now luckily have the opportunity to um review and delete so it 's not live like it was uh initially the bonus to doing live videos apart from uh the fact that the algorithm is currently rewarding them it 's also a great way um to actually get immediate interaction uh with your followers and fans so they can react comment share post questions while you 're actually um live so it 's interactive um so you can talk right back as people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out so it 's really good uh interactive content okay so moving on to the next part in the funnel which is engagement so the customer is now aware that you existed the choice among all the other brands um and so now you 're really looking to get um interaction so if you 've been managing a facebook page for a while you know that organic reach is in decline and we all know that the best way to get engagement is to get people to interact with your posts um so in 2011 uh facebook abandoned the edge rank algorithm um and is now favoring interaction so content that performs well as i mentioned are native and live videos um also if content is shared over facebook messenger obviously if the content is liked or commented on and if it receives multiple replies it shows that there 's an interaction between users so engagement is critical for organic social media so what do you need to do to make the algorithm work for you so five tips for working with the facebook algorithm start conversations that get people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um the key ranking signals is interaction so the best way to earn engagement is to be genuine be funny be curious be interesting or inspiring um and probably best not to seek out too much controversy um tapping into a strong emotions will do the trick um so just experiment if you haven 't been using social media confidently experiment um have a play you can always use your insights um to look and see what sort of opposed to getting the best interactions um but the most important thing is to start conversations that get people talking to each other the other thing is to post when your audience is online again not going to go into great detail we are um against the ticking clock today but you can see um on your own phone um you can look into uh your insights on all of your platforms to see when you 're getting the best engagement um generally the feedback is that business to business brand um posts perform best between 9am and 2pm on a tuesday wednesday and thursday and business 2 consumer brand posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i found that information online and it was repeated um so that is something to take into consideration but i always go back to your own analytics okay so never post content that will get you down ranked um so you 've got to be really careful with any fake news misleading information um there was a period there where there was a lot of click bait type of content um obviously with cambridge analytica a lot of that has now gone um but yes just be very careful don 't post nothing that 's likely to get you down ranked also videos as i 've already mentioned um high quality videos actually longer than three minutes are also now um seem to uh being quite valuable um for the facebook algorithm a lot of people um are watching past the one minute mark um but really no longer than three minutes um and then obviously what you can do is repurpose uh those videos for other um platforms and the other thing very importantly probably should probably come under as number two under starting conversation post often and consistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing that is to create some macro content which would be like a blog and then create micro pieces of content from the macro content for your social media i 'm sorry if you can hear my dog barking um i do apologize the wonders of live webinar right um so consistently and often they don 't just sort of pop up post manically for a week and then just every two months i try myself in my own business to work to show up at least three times a week across my platforms okay so also in engagement um looking at this here this this is a competition so this is you can see here like versus share so what we 're looking to do here is have two simple options that make it really really easy for someone to engage with your content um i particularly um when i was scrolling through to find some examples this is actually a walmart one but um i liked the use of the images um so and and it 's nice and big there so it makes it really easy but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to do the other thing about this is the seasonal relevance um so this was obviously shared during the spring and summer time um when during a time when people are already thinking about you know making this type of purchase this again comes back to your larger strategy and then um the other thing that 's really useful with this type of post is the re-engagement aspect of it so if you 've ever entered into some kind of competition or um something you want to check back and see you know um you know how the content or the contest is running um so for you how can you make this work for you think of two similar products that you sell that appeal to people with um with different tastes and then just do a very similar type of um post you could also use it just for general things that aren 't even related to business so batman or spiderman facebook or instagram um some of those sorts of things so this is another type of post that you can use to get engagement called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is really really simple um instead of choosing um a boring you know pick the one you like they 've gone for some really appealing language here so which flat is your favorite before obviously this is an american one but you can change it to food yourself and this post is um you know great call to action really clear what you 've got to do you can see on this has got a really really great engagement another one that 's really good for engagement is um giving a sneak peek so giving a sneak peek is one of the more complex um facebook posts but it 's got a good lasting time so simply buy something that your users uh haven 't seen to offer a preview so you can look at a project or campaign you 're developing a product that you just got into stock um or if you 've got a really exciting blog or new announcement coming up seven ticks to saving um so any upcoming development product or even new hire new staff member can be used with the sneak peek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts weeks in advance of a release date um so not only do they gain followers but it also really helps to hide whatever it is that you 're um going to be introducing one of the things i want to say on engagement is you know with the whole pay to play and the algorithm working as it is hopefully i 've given you some ideas about how to encourage engagement but we do also need to remember that a large proportion of social medias are what we call silent users they 're lurkers so they 're consuming your content but they 're not necessarily responding and again you can see this um i might one of my favorite platforms is linkedin and um quite often there 'll be posts i 'll get a lot of engagement on and others that i 'll get nothing but i can see that they have been viewed and clicked on um by the analytics so don 't always assume because someone isn 't engaging with you that they 're not connecting um and building an a connection with you it just means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly quickly moving on um okay so acquisition in the acquisition part of the funnel glossier um is a really good example of a of a company that just does all of this really really well and what i 'm using here is an example to show uh a concept called uh uh pr pro pro shimmers prostimus instead of consumers where pro posthumously never know how to say it anyway basically approxima um has developed meaning professional consumer to meaning product and brand advocate so in this um facebook post here or this post here we can see where they 're actually just using real women to market their product glossier was actually um one of the early innovators innovators of using um their customers and clients as micro influencers or super fans um as they are called um so glossier 's uh ceo emily weiss actual mantra and reason for setting up the business was to actually get women involved in the business and feeding back what they liked and didn 't like and being really involved as brand advocates to shape the company and and their offerings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i see done not very well quite often um is to make it easy for your prospects to find you find your website on your social media so here is um link tree and on here you can see by using linktree there 's lots of opportunities to click on these and then be directed back to a website and this is um actually found in your bio on instagram if you can see it here underneath the profile you actually can use linktree for free and that helps to get people back to your website another important aspect of acquisition these days is the creation of facebook shops so shops make it easy for businesses to set up a single online store on both facebook and instagram and what i 've got here um for those of you that are interested uh you can actually just uh go to uh facebook 's learning platform blue blueprint i think it 's called um and there 's lots of information in here about how to set up your facebook and instagram shop and you can actually customize the look and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors so here is an example this is ink meets paper and this is an example of their facebook shop so on instagram there is a little section called stories you can see at the top there those little circles so if your current audience likes instagram use the stories feature this is really really powerful for acquisition you can also know say now save your story so you can see those little stickers at the top there the circles that 's where they 've actually been saved under various categories so you can share content such as tutorials behind the scenes and some of those sorts of things but um next but last i 'm really gonna have to speak really really quickly um loyalty so depending on the industry you 're in retaining a current customer as i mentioned can cost you three to ten times less than acquiring a new one so it is really important to pay attention to how you 're using your social media funnel so this is about um encouraging customer reviews one of the things that i do know about millennials is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products and services they want to help you to shape new products and services um so include your customers and clients in your process and be responsive um you know every time i see an unresponded to comment on a social media um page a little bit of me dies inside so you know it 's amazing if people are commenting um you know comment back um always engage you know with your loyal customers talk to them so here is an example um it 's a big brand example it was difficult to find some smaller brand examples which is what is my preference but this is marriott hotels and they actually have a um separate page for their loyalty members here which is called marriott bomboy so they share um their bonvoi loyalty page to their hotel page to show the exclusive offers that their members are able to get so you can use your social platforms to offer rewards incentives and discounts to your loyal customers this is another great example of loyalty this is my shell beauty and this is a great promotional tool so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see here um they shared a really bold image on their instagram account in their copy in their captioning um they 've been really clear about the value of their loyalty program they 've got some great eye-catching color um enthusiastic uh caption letting their loyal customers know how the program works um and these are really these sorts of posts can be really quickly created those of you who haven 't already used canva it 's quickly quick and easy to create these types of posts um and if you uh have seen any of my social media well i 've shared them a bit today but i do all of my content creation through canvas if those that you aren 't using get onto canva another example of loyalty one of my favorite brands on social media patagonia um and so here um a good way of really um creating loyalty with your customers is sharing your company values so your company 's fundamental principles really will encourage brand loyalty from people with similar beliefs so create posts about the causes and charities that are that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands for so this is a patagonia example here and obviously most of us would know um they have made environmentalism a really important part of their brand identity so southwest airlines is another one that does come up over and over and using your socials as an opportunity to offer amazing customer service this is one of the things that i think small businesses can really really leverage from so i 've talked about responding quickly to comments queries and messages that is a really clear path to creating loyalty and good old-fashioned customer service so people will switch brands following a poor customer service experience and your social media is a big part of this so you can see here um this guy has posted uh onto their page and they 've replied straight away um with the with the query so another way to encourage loyalty is through a private facebook group so they 're really good for building connection and ongoing relationships so this is my i do have my own facebook group making sense of marketing and in your own facebook group you can create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really help them to feel appreciated and increase the likelihood that they will stay engaged and active i had a whole bunch more to say about that but i 'm money at a time so i 'm skipping on the other really important thing with anything to do with social media or your brand generally is to maintain a consistent identity across all your platforms please please please please if you learn nothing else from today go and have a look at your platforms and make sure that you are showing up consistently and easy to identify across platforms so if someone finds you on your website can they easily find you on facebook or instagram if they find you on instagram can they then easily find you on linkedin okay so maintaining consistency in both your design and your tone of voice is really really crucial eliminates any kind of confusion finally advocacy and my favorite part and probably something that you 'll want to talk about more if you book me for a one-on-one coaching session advocacy is how you turn loyal customers into proactive advocates for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends or family has and always will be the most powerful form of advertising so 92 of consumers believe suggestions from friends and family friends and family more than advertising so you need to really understand your super fans and engage them um you probably don 't need to look also any further than your employees if you 've got even one or two employees to crop to find a group of social media advocates so your employees are more likely to speak on your behalf of course because they 're invested in your businesses success so looking at advocacy you can see from this the good old days of customers listening to you blah blah blah with your marketing pitch are going so social media is very much about recommendations um or um sorry i should say generally word of mouth marketing has always been important but with the rapid communication of social media it 's on steroids so you can see sitting at there 92 recommend from people i know um so you know it 's really important um that your marketing strategy embraces um the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing okay so um again i do have a blog um on my website that you can have a look at but also this is something that we can work on one to one on one together conscious for time um there is a framework that i have that goes through this whole um unlocking the power of word of mouth marketing that i 'm happy to talk through in more detail so advocacy look at glossier this is a company that knows this really really well so the main thing glossier stands for is the power of the individual to choose their own style to make connections with other people to ask questions to understand better the things that they may want so glossier exists purely to serve what we hear from those people about what they want and this is very much in the dna of their company and in wrapping up really what i wanted to talk about in terms of advocacy social word of mouth has a lot to do with this new generation of disruptive brands that are really shaking up business i 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that know their customers really really well they invest in an engaging and aspirational brand um they build their cultures um values and ethos into the business from the ground up right and they develop exceptional end-to-end customer service experiences and they use technology to deliver it so they also combine clever storytelling with paid advertising um and they use social media not just as a marketing channel but as a way to interact with their customers um so hopefully you know what you can see from from koala uh and glossier and some of the people that i 've highlighted businesses that i 've highlighted today is the importance of building a solid brand and genuine relationship with your customers and creating an exceptional online as well as offline experience through using your social media platform so in some ways it 's kind of like a little bit of a switch to think differently about how you actually use your social media platforms i 'm sorry i had to rush through the end there lots and lots of content um courtney i 'm gonna um hand back over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes um if anyone 's got any questions but just remember that if you do any need to help any help with your marketing you can book in your free 4-hour advisory with me thanks courtney perfect thank you so much sarah what a great presentation and as sorry i mentioned we do have a couple of minutes so if you do have any questions just pop them in the chat box uh and we 'll get through them so we did have a couple come through and so we had one from selena which she 's got um what can i do to increase the followers quickly out of the very beginning when i only have a few followers oh how long is a piece of string um what platform i guess is important um i 'm going to guess we 're looking at instagram in this case um obviously one of the things i mentioned today with wheels also stories using reels and stories um if you 're doing reels make sure you use all of your 30 hashtags um spend some time doing some research on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers but also ones that are relevant to your business and also some local hashtags um but yeah that 's something i 'd be happy to discuss a bit more in a one-on-one session but hopefully that gives you a little bit of insight but really i think um creating some engaging content sit and think creatively um and what you can execute something that 's bright colorful and really resonates with your target audience who are your target audience that 's the first thing yeah okay perfect and i know you just um so i mentioned hashtags um just in your answer there when it comes to sort of hashtags how many would you recommend uh say if it was on instagram how many thirty so you can post 30 and you should post 30. yeah okay perfect and so we 've got another question so uh would a b to b professional business be better off in linkedin or facebook um okay so i do the professional services company myself i do post on all um but in terms of the best results 100 linkedin works for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page which i 've spent um the last month or so trying to build some engagement and followings on but by and large linkedin for me on um your personal profile but also facebook is really really valuable from a customer service perspective um so and also having a facebook group is also quite valuable so i 'd say those three are king for me yeah okay great um so anna had a question so um what can a time for sole trader do quickly to increase social uh marketing so i know you sort of briefly covered that but um i think pick pick your platform and then put some energy into that um so really that is a strategic type of question um but i think really fundamentally knowing knowing your clients and knowing what they want from you and how you can use that platform to offer that so remember social media can also be a channel for your customer service i know for me i never ever ring a cafe or a restaurant now i always use facebook messenger so just think about how you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other things as well okay great um so we probably have time for one one more question um so it came through from anna so she 's got how do you research hashtags um i do have a blog on that on my thing uh which is uh i 've actually got a search bar on my blog page they could just put in instagram for business um so have a look at that because it is quite convoluted um process depending on your type of business and there are actually a few free apps that you can use as well hashtag buy was one i 'm not sure if you can still use that for free but to be honest with you immersion immersion in your competitors your business um you know just really i what i would do is i would sit on instagram facebook and all of the uh my competitors as well as people that i admire in my profession and i would look and see what they are doing yeah okay great well that 's what we have time for i thank you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of one final thought thought that you 'd like to leave um everyone with today oh no not really hopefully i 've covered as much as i can i can see that the chat box is going mental and maybe if we 're able to um collect some of those questions um i 'd be happy to even i don 't know if you guys you know would want to i 'm happy to answer them in some form or another and share them um if that 's valuable sorry i talk too much no no no no it 's a lot of information so um well that 's what we have time for today thank you for everyone uh that jumped on board and uh watched the presentation we will also uh just to let you know have the recordings all the recordings that we 've done over the past month will be available on the city of ride website so you 'll be able to go on there and watch the recordings but um thanks again thanks sarah and thank you to everyone that joined us today see you later"

    "text": "welcome to our webinar firstly thank you for joining us today my name is courtney sandor and i 'm the events assistant here at realise business so today 's webinar is brought to you by the city of ride and funded by new south wales treasury for small business month so realize business is a leading social enterprise empowering people to successfully run a business uh through our events we bring our presenters advisors and members together to share their expert knowledge in the interest of helping each other to learn and grow to their highest potential so before we get started i 'm just going to run through some quick housekeeping points so we ask that you stay on mute for the duration of the webinar let us know if you 're having any audio or video issues ask questions at any time we will be having a q a at the end so just put pop your questions in the chat box and this session is being recorded uh so now without further ado i 'd like to introduce today 's presenter realized business advisor james of avenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got a few of you there so fantastic and thankfully i don 't now courtney um if you could just unmute for a moment people can see the screen but they can 't see my face correct uh so we have your video on so they should be able to see oh look okay i 'm really i 'm really sorry everyone as you can see i 've got a great face for radio but the reason that my head looks this way i had a number one haircut a fortnight ago because i lost a bit so i 'm sorry that you have to look at me this way i usually have hair but not today anyway thank you very much for coming this has been brought to you as courtyard just said by the city of ryde in realized business thanks to funding by the new south wales government right so a big shout out to new south wales government fantastic okay so let 's move right along now um as courtney had said we 're going to have a q a at the end but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means ask a question via the chat room okay so without further ado here we go fantastic okay now just going back that screen if you sell to other businesses so if your small business is selling to another business linkedin is the platform to use okay so this is the title of this morning 's webinar okay so linkedin is the platform to use okay so let 's let 's continue now that 's me really boring you can see my head that 's what i have here so yeah i 'm an old guy so i 've been around and done things so anyway so moving along okay so today two-thirds of our time together will be spent in me presenting the content of using linkedin when you sell to a to another to another business the remaining third is for q a because i hate going to online uh online um the web sessions and and face-to-face workshops and so on when when they talk for an hour and they give you three minutes to ask a question that 's not enough so i 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be q a so make sure you think of some really good and hard and difficult questions and please raise them at the end so moving along again okay now here 's a question for you how many of you have more than 500 plus first degree connections on linkedin if you can just raise your hand in the chat room okay how many of you have more than 500 connections so when you see this i need you to act upon something okay so this is an interactive webinar to keep you awake to keep you engaged so when you see this particular slide it means that you have to do something okay so basically raise your hand in the chat i 've got the chat open so i only want those people who have more than 500 first-degree linkedin connections to raise their hand come on people you know how to do it open up the group chat and i only want to see those people who have more than 500. if i don 't see any hands i 'm going to assume that you have less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings a bell fantastic norman thank you yes uh sarah 420 come on sarah you can do it fantastic okay some other people come on come on we 've got more than chris and norman and uh and sarah come on don 't be shy okay so essentially of the group we have three people essentially that have 500 or close to 500 more it 's really important okay um that you have more than 500 only because of the fact that in your profile it 'll show its total as 500 plus now you may have 501 and that 's great but it will just show it as 500 plus those other people who have 10 000 uh first degree connections will also have 500 plus i have 30 000 first degree and mine will show 500 plus because if you have something less than 500 it shows the the actual sort of number and it it implies that the person who had particular profile isn 't serious about the linkedin so that 's just a little tip to start them all rolling okay make sure you get sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of you okay as much as you can just invite people it 's not that hard and so on okay so moving along now let me just go to this arrow here great now um what is linkedin okay linkedin 's been around for a while okay it 's been around for i was one of the first users and i remember using it i think it 's been around for about 12 years now and it predates facebook i think by a year or so anyway so what is linkedin put really simply this is what it is okay you can read that i don 't need to read it read it for you but it 's specifically business professionals now that business professional could be working for a large corporate they could be working for a government departments they could be um working for a not-for-profit or whatever but people often are you know linkedin 's for big business no it 's for all business small medium and large and everything else in between okay so please don 't think that linkedin isn 't for you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for you okay so people can say to me oh you know linkedin it 's just uh it 's just a um it 's like facebook for business i 've only got one thing to say to that folks wrong it is not facebook for business i do not want to see what you had for breakfast i do not want to see as a linkedin user where you went for your break i don 't want to see the new car that you just bought okay i 'm not interested okay with complete respect of course because linkedin isn 't for that okay so although it 's a social network take out the word social and put in the word business it 's a business network for business people doing business okay if there 's one thing that you take away from today which i 'm sure you 'll take away a lot it is a business network not a social network although that slide that i showed before the definition of linkedin describes it as a social network it 's not it 's not really the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facebook instagram or their of networks great uh linkedin is not okay so please keep that in mind now because because of the time that we have i 'm not the sort of person to cram in 27 things for you to remember okay i 'm only going to emphasize two really really important things to consider to think about and actually do when you are using linkedin for your business okay just two not nine not one not f just two okay keeping it really really simple now um sorry i jumped ahead a little bit um uh the two things comes a little bit later the reason that the two reasons why why linkedin is important are two reasons one google okay the reason that linkedin 's important that if i if you google my name okay chances are my first result although i 'm quoted in other places and done some things and have my own site and all that probably the first one or two search results my linkedin profile because linkedin is so pervasive in google okay it 's really important that your presence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can possibly to make it okay and we can talk about profiles and so forth some some other time but what 's important to know is that your presence on linkedin okay is crucial you 're going to appear in search results all the time because linkedin is everywhere okay now the second reason why linkedin is important and needs your attention apart from google is this company microsoft now you may know this you may not um in two in june of 2016 microsoft bought linkedin for 26 billion dollars u.s microsoft did not pay that amount of of us cash to have linkedin sitting on a shelf linkedin um in the last four years has has just grown and grown and grown and it 's been integrated into all of microsoft 's offerings when it comes to the business um to the extent that i had a friend just the other month send me a cv to review and i 've never seen this before um i 've seen i 've seen i 've seen cvs before of course but i 've never seen this particular link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word doc i opened it up and up came this pop-up that said hey we just we 've just noticed that you 're opening up a cv would you like to compare the best cvs in sydney in the same market segment that we 've found on linkedin so it actually read as it were the cv of my friend knew it was a cv knew that he was an accountant and wanted to present him a curated list of the best of the top 10 accounting cvs in the sydney market in real time it 's just just amazing it 's incredible and that 's just one aspect so linkedin is everywhere it 's really important so those two reasons google and microsoft make linkedin very much worth your while okay now one one key thing to remember about linkedin okay cliches are cliches because they 're often true linkedin is a great example okay of something that you only get out of it what you put in okay um because i 've been using linkedin for um a long time people often come to me when i speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh james i 've been on linkedin now for three years hasn 't done a thing for me so i say okay well let 's have a look at your profile so bring up their profile on their phone and it 's got no photo this person has 14 first degree connections okay and the only bit of information on this individual 's profile is that he went to uh dundas infant school in 1959. that 's not a good look it really isn 't consider linkedin as a way of people finding out about you much more than a pile of business cards because i don 't know about you i 've never come across a sort of business card that told me information beyond what the individual 's name is what their contact details are what their current job isn 't on the thing with linkedin it gives you all that but it gives you their previous job whether they went to university where they went to school who recommends them projects that they 've worked on okay groups that they 're a part of even even their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to have as complete as you can possibly to make it okay and there 's lots of things out there just google okay how do i improve my linkedin profile and there 's a lot of stuff out there okay good stuff so moving along okay let 's talk about linkedin and business okay linkedin and business two things this is where i got confused before i 'm sorry i want you to learn two things about linkedin and when it comes to linkedin and business in today 's uh okay just two things okay just two things now these two things okay they 're not a silver sort of bullet they won 't um it 's just not a silver bullet it 's not it 's not a miracle it 's not a shortcut but these two things work but they take time that old saying from their famous ad on tv a few years ago it won 't happen overnight but will happen but these things are slow burned okay it takes time but i guarantee that these two things work because i 've used them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth okay they use them because they they basically work but it takes time okay with anything worthwhile it takes time so these two ways uh or i 'll say it up front are very very very simple but they take time to build okay so let 's move along okay now the number one thing okay that i want you to remember about using linkedin when it comes to your business okay the number one thing is this don 't sell i repeat don 't sell linkedin is not amazon it 's not ebay it 's not gumtree you are not there to sell okay i can 't stress this point enough now there are people selling on to linkedin but they are doing it the wrong way okay they 're doing it completely the wrong way okay it 's too in your face it 's too brash okay so the number one thing that i want you to remember about using linkedin when you 're using it for your business is don 't sell so i hear you thinking if that 's doable thinking well so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what else am i doing okay so here here hands up okay in the chat box okay hands up okay and i want a few responses okay what 's what 's if if you don 't sell okay what can you do or what should you do in linkedin now i 'm going to open up the chat box and i hit the um the next slide by mistake okay so in the chat box if you 're not selling what should you be doing on linkedin okay we 've heard from chris norman and sarah in terms of the size of their first degree networks okay um selena thank you share your expertise anna branding and education very very good okay some other people come on up sarah communicate finding information read people yeah yeah yeah good good good fantastic come on some other people so far it 's just the women where are the men come on come on men you can do it you can do it i know you 're out there i 've got great responses from selena anna and sarah come on man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your network very very good very very good yeah one more blog come on one more bloke we 've got three women and one bloke come on just one more blow uh hope i hope you 're a woman aren 't you fantastic your links in context that 's great i love the name hope it 's wonderful uh okay your links in context okay good if you 're not selling what do you do um you 're definitely all on the right track now i need to hear from one more bloke come on we 've got four women and two blokes come on norman where are you come on anyone a bloke courtney i don 't know these blokes gee whiz they 're thinking they 're thinking all right well let 's not let 's not labor the point too much you 're all on the right track okay so thanks for sharing those things okay just get rid of this fantastic um right so we 've just answered that there are two things okay if you 're not selling you are wanting to do two things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things are not selling these are things that actually help you set yourself apart by informing by adding to value to your audience okay through education and through influence okay those are those are nice things and so on they seem a little bit soft but people often ask me well well james how okay how does one educate how does one influence okay on linkedin believe me there are so many ways so so so many ways you 've done this already either directly or indirectly but you 've probably done it in an ad hoc way just every now and then okay so what are some of the ways uh by sharing the website that you have in linkedin believe it or not by blogging youtube clips twitter pinterest other social networks people don 't realize that linkedin should be a channel for your own site okay so if you have your own website which you have your own blog or your own youtube channel and so on linkedin is just one other channel what ideally should happen is that people find you on linkedin they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can read your blog or they go to your youtube channel or whatever okay so think of linkedin as a front door into your your world okay into primarily your website okay so those are just some of the ways but linkedin has has some incredible um has incredible power to basically connect across the internet to so many other sort of platforms but the big ones are of course you can share it share it onto the facebook um that 's not really my cup of tea but certainly youtube i 'm very much into blogs but anything that actually helps the person into your world okay linkedin can provide okay these are some really key ways now moving along okay here are some other ways okay a linkedin introduction a linkedin endorsement updates on linkedin recommendations in mail okay these are things that these are really simple devices within linkedin that basically help you um be active in the network now i just want to ask let me just bring up the chat again i just want to ask the quick question who here has used i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flipped the mouse too much okay who here has actually used at least one of these devices you 've endorsed someone or you 've recommended someone or you use an introduction or you 've updated just give me a sense please just a yes or no thank you chris yes it 's good someone else no sarah yes indoors thank you norman some other people i know from selena no from anna no from hope anyone else okay um it 's probably the reason that you don 't know what you don 't know these things are actually really important i 've used all of these um with intent and it actually helps okay so without burning up time now i would really like you afterwards okay again you can google this inside you know i mean we could talk about this for days okay but what i 'd like you to do is think about a way in which you can engage with your audience more your first big thing of course for those who don 't have a network of over 500 is to get there okay but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these things updates is really really straightforward linkedin introduction allows you to introduce someone in your network to someone else okay that 's pretty easy you can endorse someone that 's self-explanatory but just try some things okay in male is basically the internal male male sort of system within linkedin but it 's very very very straightforward i would i would look at a couple of things i would start to update once you reach more than 500 and i 'd like you to see because this talks about you but i 'd like you to serve people these three linkedin recommendations endorsements and linkedin introductions serve others okay so i 'd like you to do this because this serves you but i 'd like you to do at least one of the other three okay and you can read how they work and so on on linkedin itself okay but it 's actually really important because you 're serving people okay you 're actually being active all right so let 's let 's move along okay now as we said before the uh the other thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to stand out you want to have influence look at all these you know these dead bulbs here okay and here 's one i don 't know if these other bulbs are led but this one 's on and it 's standing up and it 's bright and that 's what i want for you when you 're working with linkedin okay so how does one do that so how does one build influence on linkedin hands up here 's another question for you to be interactive okay can you open up the chat again can you please tell oh gosh this mouse sorry hands up you 've got a bit of ink there hands up how do you build influence within linkedin how do you build influence into the chat and give me an answer please how do you build influence or gain influence in linkedin come on everyone come on come on anna and selena and norman and chris post share other articles norman very very good very good someone else how do you build influence the question is how do you build or gain influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else come on come on there 's more ouch there 's more out there than norman come on don 't be shy there 's no right or wrong answer write something original selena very very good yes very very good who else apart from norman and celina come on you guys guys in a generic sense share interesting articles as opposed to boring articles yes yeah people don 't like reading things that aren 't interesting why would you life is way too short so thanks for that chris come on two more please two more we 're not going to proceed until we get two more come on come on you can do it you can do it come on two more please you 've heard from chris we 've heard from celina we 've heard from norman come on two more two more you 're holding everyone up you 're holding me up come on uh liking other posts sarah very very good very good okay one more please come on male or female doesn 't matter ah here we go anna subject matter expertise sharing oh it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right track okay but the way to really stand out okay really stand out on linkedin is as some of you have suggested is writing an article okay it 's actually right one but let 's open up this okay currently as of i think august of 2020 there are 660 it 's a million members of linkedin now not all of those are active but let 's assume that half were active okay that 's still a huge number huge number now for a um virtual mars bar okay who here can tell me how many of those 660 well let 's say 330 okay because half are inactive how many as a percentage okay how many linkedin members publish an original article so that means that they 're not sharing an article they 're not reposting or anything like that that they found something online or they found something in a magazine or whatever how many actually post something original something that they themselves have constructed okay they themselves have instructed open up the chat and let me know okay as a percentage i 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got okay hope i said 10 norman said less than five one three oh maybe a one uh rider with one percent selena three percent chris less than two anna one percent that 's not very nice anna come on surely they 're more engaging than that sarah 50 oh well sarah is very being very very sort of generous now i think the club i think a couple of you got very very very close uh drum please call me for a virtual mars bar and the number is hands up we 've just done that the number is point five of one percent so it 's not even one percent it 's half a percent okay so this is uh that 's um of that huge number of active members okay only half a percent actually write something that they 've created themselves so this brings up the obvious statement if you really want to stand out if you really want to stand out on linkedin you write something that is interesting that is engaging and that 's origin you might be thinking oh james i can 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write you can do it but it 's going to be something interesting engaging okay and your first one will suck but your second one will suck a little bit less than your third one so it 'll just get better and better now i 've because i 'm very old i 've done i 've done quite a few things now i 've actually and i 'm not saying this to show off i 'm saying it because it 's true of uh written um six books okay the first two were self published um and the last four have been published by a large house called thompson reuters have trouble saying that who in my field of professional services accounting law tax and so forth um very very big names my last four have been done with them my first book as my boys said at the time dad this book isn 't it 's not actually sort of rubbish it aspires to be rubbish one day it will be rubbish so the whole point here my first book was complete and utter garbage the second book was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more that you do it the better you get at it okay and especially when you move from the fact that you do things yourself and then you 're backed by a large firm you 've got to get things right but the point is the more that you do it the better you 'll get now that 's writing books and they 're very long and so on but with posts okay um uh with an article you would have seen this on the internet and the train 's been probably the last three to five years that this has appeared um it actually tells you um in lots of places on the internet um how long it takes you to read something so the average reading time for 100 words is 60 seconds okay so if it 's 200 words it 's going to take you two minutes okay my suggestion to you is to never write anything especially when you 're starting off that is longer than you know to read than two minutes so that means 200 words okay and you might think oh 200 words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article that you write you talk about one thing just one thing okay and if you don 't like your style get someone else because it 's very hard to edit because you 're the writer and so on but that when i first found this out it 's an absolute shock one-half of one percent so if you want to stand out on linkedin write original stuff and share it now so the first big thing okay is to educate and influence okay don 't sell educate and influence don 't sell educated influence that 's the first thing okay the number two thing is be consistent and follow up be consistent means that if you 're going to post original stuff don 't do it once every three and a half months if you 're really going to do this do something do something small but do it well but do it consistently if you 're going to do it if it was me i 'd do it once a week or if that 's too too often try once a month okay but you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you didn 't think of anything you 've got to do month one month two month three month four i um on this other project because i wanted to improve my google ranking for this project that i was working on on the time i blogged original things which i shared through linkedin and so on but it was on my own website i blogged three times a week every week every month for nine months and my google ranking in terms of the search index climbed from i think i was on page the bottom of page 17 up to the second organic search result okay and that took a lot of hard work but it brought fruit okay so this is the second big thing about linkedin and business be consistent and follow up so moving on to the next slide okay these things these are things that you can be consistent okay and you sort of follow up the only time that i 've made income from linkedin is when i 've done these things when i 've actually introduced someone when i 've endorsed someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just doesn 't mean to say that you just live in linkedin and you 're not allowed to phone someone up or send them an email as opposed to an email okay there 's no rule against that okay the only time that i 've made a fee from providing my my services in my own middle to business is when i 've taken the conversation out of linkedin and taken it offline taking it into the real world okay that 's really important be consistent and follow up with people now the best times that i 've made a fee is when i 've done this i 've actually had a cup of coffee with someone because people buy from people okay so just don 't just don 't feel that ah it 's got to be all online no no no no it doesn 't doesn 't have to be in fact if anything and you don 't do this with everyone that you are that 's part of your own network or whatever you 've got to be judicious you 've got to be selective but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 years i 've i 've used linkedin for half of that period and the only time that it 's made an impact for me is when i 've taken it offline and actually met with someone over a cup of coffee now moving along story time story time now i won 't give you the name of the person this guy was a senior partner in quite a large accounting firm here here in sydney okay and it was a top 10 firm if i said the name to you you probably would have heard of them okay so he was head of their aged care division okay and he was working for clients all around australia and he thought to himself he thought you know there must be a better way to actually share what i know with people so probably about maybe five years ago he started to build up the things that he was doing in linkedin he um got his profile um sort of updated had a good photo of him he had more than 500 to start off with and he started to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the aged care sector around australia now people think oh yeah well this guy 's a gun isn 't he 's probably 30 35 no when he started he was i think he said he was 59 when he started now he 's older of course but he got to the stage where he was sharing things and people like he would be at at an event and someone would come up to him and say hey you 're john smith aren 't you i 've been reading your stuff on linkedin it 's actually really really good would it be okay if we got together because one of our one of our own clients has an aged care facility that that is facing you know some series through you know some serious challenges can you help out and that and that just came with nothing that that was an indirect approach now this guy let 's call him john that 's not his real name john smith he um had to go to perth one day okay um so he had a few days a few days to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be in perth um at the end of this week and um and i 'm doing this and this and this out of that one update he had two potential clients from perth contact invites to linkedin and say look and this is the first time that they have been in touch with him said look we 've been reading your stuff on linkedin and you seem to really know what you 're going on about you know sorry like you seem to know what you 're on about can we arrange a time to meet when you 're in perth it 's a cut a long story short he met them and i think not on both occasions straight away but on one of those two to the meetings he got work straight away but that meeting was like a third meeting because the first two meetings as it were in terms of people getting to know you and so on was already done through linkedin so he walked out with uh i don 't know what the fee was at the time but it was quite substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty thousand okay from one of those new people and the second one he got i think a few weeks later because they wanted to do stuff by the phone via email but but this really surprised john because he said that the indirect benefit of people saying that you really know your material you really know your stuff and you 're sharing it on linkedin he didn 't sell once linkedin positioned him as a thought leader okay and he 's invited to conferences and so on to the extent that um a couple of years ago he left this big firm and set up his own firm focused primarily only on the aged care sector and he 's doing really really well so that 's just one true story okay and that 's in sydney and it 's not from some young tech savvy sort of person it 's from a guy and and this guy john is not tech savvy he 's just he 's just a well he 's an accountant so he 's methodical and he just thought well if other people can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true story and he 's done really well out of it now moving along i notice the time okay let 's keep calm okay there 's lots of stuff to do but keep calm and let 's wrap things up so moving along what are the two things okay i 'm going to open up the chat and again for a virtual mars bar i want you to start interrupt where do we write the charity word articles okay i will get to that selena in the q a okay i will tell you where that is okay um now uh question okay what are the two things if you can write in the chat room that uh that i want you to take away from today in terms of what you are doing with linkedin and your business what are the two things don 't sell sarah virtual mars bar for you that 's very good and what 's the other one so one is don 't sell oh sarah what do you do when you 're not when you don 't sell what are the two things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true but that 's not part of the two things the influence uh fantastic sarah thank you the other one had had two things in it okay we 've already got don 't sell but the other one is be consistent uh fantastic be consistent and follow up very good hope thank you so that 's what it is don 't sell and be consistent and follow up if someone sends you something in linkedin don 't ignore it respond to it okay respond to it and you 'll come up with rules and so forth now i want to remain true to the time we 've just hit how good is that courtney courtney how good is that it 's 11 40. exactly two-thirds in we 're now moving to our q a now um uh if you want a question asked um pl or sorry if you want to if you want to ask a question put it in the chat and we 'll respond to it but courtney is it okay if i respond to selena yes of course yeah now i 'm still sharing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm actually going to show you live um if that 's okay how do i set up a linkedin business page we 'll get to that can we repost our website blog yeah let 's get to that but but this will help everyone so i 'm going to be doing a a new shift that 's okay so i 'm going to go to linkedin um let me see do i have firefox open good okay so i 'm gonna share this oh am i sharing good i 'm gonna go to linkedin now uh courtney can you please confirm that you can see my screen yes okay and now should be blinked in um it 's just slowly loading up yep yep oh the nbn has been a bit slow this morning i don 't know why but hey okay so everyone if you can just look at the screen footage at the moment um linkedin is loading up um coming to you live from monaval in sydney and it 's incredibly slow and i don 't know why it 's usually a lot faster anyway so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um i 'm just waiting for it to load up i 'm sorry selena where do you basically share the words case see this thing here this little box share a post if i click on that okay if i click on that it 's not i don 't know why it 's not loading okay i want to do something okay so i want to write something okay so i want to just start writing okay uh to anyone um and i 'm sorry that it 's really slow loading if i hit this it 'll be anyone anyone on twitter connections only or whatever so essentially and i won 't bore you with the advanced stuff but all you have to do to start a post is click on here which is at the top okay and essentially you can start to write you can put in photos you can put into the video you can find an attachment but but you right here okay you 're actually right here and if you and it doesn 't give you a word link so what i tend to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length and cut and paste it and put it into that so i hope that helps okay so courtney if you can take us through yes we 've got a couple of questions um so we had one come through from hope uh so she 's got can we repost our website blog yes yeah okay um usually a website depending upon what you have if you 're using wordpress or you 're using wix or squarespace and so on there are these little tools little plugins that allow you to repost the article to linkedin or facebook or twitter or a whole range of things but the short answer is yes yeah okay great um so we had one come through from chris so how do i set up a linkedin business page um i wish we had time to do that just google it it is really really straightforward but before you do that chris i really want you to have a very good chris personal linkedin page okay because the two are linked okay so make sure your individual profile when people google your name and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as good as you can actually do it it 's got to have a good photo it 's got to have a good headline it 's got to have some activity some detail and so on so google how you set up a page for your own sort of business but before doing that make sure your individual one is top notch okay great um so we had one from anna so what are the exceptions against using linkedin what are the sorry can you please repeat it so she 's got what are the exceptions against using linkedin what are the exceptions against using linkedin sorry um sarah uh is it sarah that asked that i have sorry um and i don 't understand the question are you are you asking one of the times to not use linkedin um sorry i don 't i don 't understand the question could you please rephrase it and retype it okay so she 's got another one come through so she 's got is it better to do a linkedin original post or share a web post um if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post is from your own website and it 's original yes absolutely but if it 's something that you 've just found on the new york times or you know or um or um sydney morning heard or new idea magazine or whatever no it 's always better to write something original only because of the fact that as we had had discussed earlier only half a percent of people write things that are original so it 's not that they get lost in all that but there is so much i 've read articles you know that appeared ten times a thousand times ten thousand like the same article and that 's good the first couple of times but it doesn 't really work if you really want to stand out and want to get a reputation for sharing things that really counts you 've got to craft your own content that 's what 's really that 's what linkedin rewards are the most okay okay so she 's also mentioned what business isn 't linkedin friendly what business isn 't linkedin friendly um it 's not linkedin friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're a um a shop or an online store and you 're only selling to individuals you 're selling to mums and dads and boys and girls and so forth okay this is primarily and the whole point of this time this morning together is to actually have your business sell to another business so i don 't have any expertise in how to use linkedin for selling to individuals per se uh there is a case to be made because people say but there are lots of people on linkedin that are executives and they 're paid lots of money and i want to go and capture that to the market we 'll go for it but um but that 's not the point of what we 're discussing this morning it 's for you to sell to something like it could be a small business selling to another small business or a small business selling to a large business or a government department or a not-for-profit organization okay so the exceptions for this particular time that we 've shared this morning is we don 't sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a whole point yeah okay great um so we had one through from sarah so she says i know how to send a message to a group of contacts does this group save in my contacts um yes the the actual group itself it depends if you 're the person who started the group then you track everything of course but if you 're a member of a group and you 're contributing to that group usually what happens is that the convener of the group allows the uh as were they as it were or interactions to be saved but they have the right to delete old posts for example um but but you 've got to actually if what you 're asking is can i link to the p can i connect to the people that are made up of the group yes through invitation but but they can say no yeah okay great um norman 's written is having a premium membership to linkedin worth it as an employee long answer no i um and not to show off anything but people find out you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phone call out of the blue from this from this magazine and they and i had no idea that this was actually on the cards they were doing a feature article on linkedin and australian sort of business and i found out that i was the most connected australian in sorry the most connected australian on linkedin so i was number one in australia and new zealand and number 77 in the world now um at the time we didn 't have 660 uh uh you know huge membership was 660 mil back then it had probably about 300 million but people think oh it changed your life no no because all i did was build um these network and help people and people invited me and i did things and so on so for me i 've got a huge network absolutely huge but do i know the people no i know point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero two percent okay but that 's not the point the point is that i have access to people through others and i share things and so on so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i felt really bad that year because because i had such a huge network that i actually signed up for the premium one for one year and then i stopped it because it wasn 't worth it and there are some and i shouldn 't say this there are some for want of a better term shortcuts and workarounds and hacks where you don 't need the premium one so norman save your money i 'd much rather you join realize business no no but no you don 't need it the free one 's fine everyone 's fine okay great um so we had my question come through from selena so do you mean not creating the linkedin business page until you have 500 connections where do you suggest to post articles from a personal profile or business page um the way that i i built up mine was that because i was you know it 's only me in the business i don 't have a business page as such it 's just me so i 'm somewhat biased in this i would much prefer that you build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things and so on and if you want to then have us then have a secondary page for your business okay the two are linked of course but um i i 've seen company pages that are fantastic but the individual who 's the ceo has a rubbish individual profile and it just doesn 't make sense so i 'd much rather especially in a small business much more than a larger business i would work on on your individual profile first get up to 500 have a good photo have good content there then if you want set up a page for your business okay perfect um hopes also come through so and how to contact somebody uh when share does not come up with the person 's profile yeah um you can only share something sorry you only share something with people that are part of the network okay either your first degree second degree or third degree so that means that if you want to share with them you have to invite them to join you linkedin does not allow you to share with people outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network first either as a first degree secondary or third degree um and um then you can share things with them okay perfect and so how much time does it take to be effective on linkedin would you say ah what an interesting question often ask this people say oh james i 've been on linkedin now for you know three years it 's done there 's another thing for me and then like i said before they well as you know you only get out of it what you put into it okay it took me um and i didn 't try so i joined on linkedin in 2007 so that 's 13 years ago and it took me six years to become number one not that i had that purpose but i was just doing things i was just sharing articles i was inviting people in fact i ran out of invitations it 's changed now i ran out of invitations because you 're only issued 3 000 invites so um i issued those so people found me to read my articles and said oh can and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look if if you do things consistently okay you build up a body of work on linkedin your articles your updates and so forth um if it was me and you know i 'm a big believer in doing lots of small things consistently and well i do something just something small each day spend five minutes a day 10 minutes a day and it 's quite amazing that after a week after a month after three months after 12 months okay all those little bits really really add up and you 'll have a body of work to point to now i spent a lot more than that in the early days but now i don 't do anything i get invitations all the time and i 've got criteria and um i can only accept up to up to thirty thousand connections so i keep a few free for friends so it 's just below thirty thousand but um if it was me i 'd i 'd give you 12 months but do something each day just do something small and you 'll enjoy it you enjoy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results but it 's a slow burn it takes time yeah um we probably have one more time one question time for one more question sorry and so we had one through from anna so she 's got what is first second third degree contact ah okay um this is the heart of linkedin anna a first degree say are your friends second degree are friends of friends and third degree our friends are friends of friends okay so usually when i say 500 plus that is your 500 plus friends those are the people closest to you now of my thirty thousand almost thirty thousand first degree friends i probably know personally a thousand of them okay but i don 't know the other twenty nine thousand my second degree is eight point five mil and my third degree is 34 million now i won 't i won 't explain to you how the how the these sort of maths work but friends of friends become friends of friends through every contact that they have so say for example if you were to send me an invite and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second degree becomes your third degree so you will see your third degree just go through the roof with eight and a half million extra people now people think how does it all work look i won 't bore you now with with all this exponential stuff but it 's a fact that people know people if i told two people to say look can you invite two of your friends each and say the same thing to those people the one becomes you know um well basically becomes four then it becomes eight so and so on it 's like um the old i don 't know if you guys have heard this there are 64 um squares on a chessboard okay if i put a grain of rice on square one okay and then doubled it for every square after that so on square one it 's one grain of rice on square two it 's two grains of rice on square three it 's four grains of rice how many grains of rice would i have on square 64. would anyone like to guess there 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rice it is in the trillions of trillions okay because that 's the power of exponential growth okay so and that 's why you know just as an aside that 's why coronavirus that 's why they say that we 've got to be below a growth rate of 1.0 because anything a point above 1.0 is is a forerunner to exponential growth and it 's a real real issue so um i hope that helps so i hope you 've learned something okay um now as a gift to all of you okay because being just a generous guy like i said i keep some spots free friends by all means you can send me an invite and i will accept them my usual criteria for accepting invites is that i accept no invite with a person who doesn 't have a photo i don 't accept an invite with someone who uses a logo as their photo and i definitely don 't accept an invite from someone who uses homer simpson as their profile photo because chances are a person doesn 't look like homer simpson okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those three areas i will accept your invite and by all means keep in touch and as we say of course realize is here to help you um our first four hours are completely free of charge because we 're paid by the government right and the next 30 hours are heavily subsidised if you need help just google us or just type into google realize business go to the website and our friendly staff at hq people like the wonderful courtney will be more than happy to assist you i hope you 've

    "text": "everyone and welcome to our webinar firstly thank you for joining us my name is courtney sandal and i 'm the events assistant here at realized business today 's webinar is brought to you by the city of wright and funded by new south wales treasury for small business month realize business is a leading social enterprise empowering people to successfully run a business uh through our events we bring our presenters advisors and members together to share their expert knowledge in in the interest of helping each other to learn and grow to their highest potential so before we get started i 'm just going to run through some quick housekeeping points so all attendees are mute for the webinar let us know if you have any audio or video issues ask questions at any time we will be having a q a session at the end uh so use the chat box to ask the questions and this session is being recorded so without further ado i 'd now like to introduce today 's presenter realize business advisor and marketing expert jessica alfonzo hi everyone it 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is jessica alfonso and my mission is to empower small businesses and startups to unlock their full potential so they can thrive in the digital era i started launching my first business at the age of 20 and from then on it 's been such an adventure so weirdly enough it was a threading business i would never imagine to be doing anything digital at all i was a i was a bit of a technophobe myself but then i um i started volunteering in startups and it just so happened that i was in the right place and at the right time because the startup i was volunteering for ended up being a multi-million dollar company and i was the fourth employee in the business and the first one in marketing and uh now there 's 20 people in the marketing position and about i don 't know 100 or 200 members of staff in that company um and so it was a wild adventure and i learned a lot on the journey particularly um with facebook ads and sort of down the line i decided to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i 've worked with all sorts of companies uh cyber security drones drone education um language education beauty coaching uh hospitality real estate so i 've dabbled with a whole series of backgrounds and my specialty is definitely around google and facebook ads and analytics so finding out where where money 's been put on the table and where it can best go um and so i 've dedicated myself three years of helping small business owners to be the masters of their own marketing so i teach people who i enable them how to do their own graphic design read their own analytics run their own facebook and google ads and see if it 's a cash positive return so that 's a bit about me and today we 're going to cover four different aspects we 're going to cover the foundations of a facebook ad um some of you might be in a space where it 's generating you lots of likes and people are sharing your content perhaps they 're commenting but somehow along the way they 're not translating to sales so we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen be really effective in when doing facebook advertising we 'll also cover the importance of your avatar or your persona uh some of you might have dabbled into this but for those of you who maybe haven 't been across it an avatar or a persona is a fictional character that you make up and it 's supposed to represent your customer base uh thirdly we 'll cover the different placement positions on facebook so that would be uh facebook and instagram or facebook uh what and whatsapp i 'll just delve into that when we get to it and last but not least we 'll cover about the um we 'll cover the facebook pixel what that 's about what that involves and how how does it impact our our performance when running facebook ads just in the next slide here um what i always say when it comes to social media marketing is you 've got to have really solid foundations otherwise what you 're essentially doing is building a house of cards and the wind blows and they all tumble over so social media marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudspeaker in front of what you 've already got so you need to make sure as business owners we need to all make sure that we have solid foundations so then it 's not going to topple over when we run facebook ads and so how do we build these foundations or or what do these foundations fault involve uh first of all it 's uh your customer journey i think i 've got it yeah so your customer journey is the journey that people take click by click until they get into a purchase or it might be that they it generates a phone call for people to you know get on the phone with you and so each business needs to have a specific journey or road map and this is really really critical to have it written on pen and paper or have a really solid plan as to how it 's going otherwise it can be quite an expensive endeavor facebook marketing and that 's the other thing i should note when you 're optimizing for sales or for phone calls expect to pay a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sort of the the aim of the game but let 's say for example in an e-commerce store uh people generally would land on your website they might click on the product and then add it to the cart and then from the cart they 'd go ahead and purchase it we 're all familiar with that journey or even if you call a plumber and so you log into the website and you read the the first page and then you make a phone call immediately after that so that that 's uh that 's a customer journey and it doesn 't just have to be facebook specific it can be anything as well it can be um it can be totally offline but it 's just got to be a measurable roadmap so you can assess the performance of your marketing endeavors the benefit of having a customer journey means you get to measure and you also get to assess the user experience what that means is is the website presentable is it loading fast enough is that communicating with your ideal audience if none of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads run and again it can be a costly endeavor so the the beauty about a customer journey is you can measure that experience that the customer is having the next thing i want to talk about is your content i think i 'm just gonna move this here your content can improve your ad performance by 90 percent um so it 's a huge thing to get involved in and that is um first what people see your your design your image or video that you 're presenting and your your message to them that the text that goes to accompany that and perhaps even a web page that you send them to but all of those things have to have a critical part in in that customer journey and in sending people um into into a great user experience and as a business owner more roi for you so um a lot of people in marketing are constantly day in day out testing different images and seeing what is more appealing to customers and it 's also in facebook 's best interest to have the most appealing images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep people in the platform so your image your design your video and your message is hugely important this one is critical as well for for business owners your budgets and calculations so the average cost per click for people to click on a website let 's say on facebook is ballpark two dollars now that might be different across industries but out of all the industries there are um you 're expecting about two dollars a click and and you just have to be mindful of your advertising costs for example let 's say um there 's uh you 're selling dresses or shoes let 's say shoes now for you say your shoes are twenty dollars online and it 's uh it takes you eight dollars to create twenty dollars that is twelve dollars revenue per user and you have to be you have to really think about your overheads you have to think about shipping costs and you have to think about um your operational costs um so think about it whether it makes sense for your business i 've seen some spectacular business models and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some other businesses have yeah they 're really fitting for facebook so really um have a sit down and and crunch these numbers um or come and speak with one of the advices and and we 'll will give you a hand in doing that calculation it 's really important to do your forecasting and really lay your expectations before getting into facebook ads and spending so really think about what it would take to create an roi positive experience for you i have a feeling i 'm going to get a few questions about these and i 'm happy to answer them at the end and the other thing is your competitive advantage and one thing i have to be clear when i ask people maybe you 've heard unique selling proposition usp or competitive advantage when i ask people and they tell me something if your competitors are doing it 's not a competitive advantage it 's just an advantage which which is great it 's fabulous to have an advantage but a competitive advantage is something where you will stand up to your competition an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a removalist company they were your typical removalist company nothing you know nothing special to them or nothing unique um and they were looking at having a competitive advantage and they realized that the lgbt community i know there 's a few more alphabets in their letters of the alphabet but i don 't know what they are i apologize um but that community were not having a positive experience with uh removalists they they were very much or very unfriendly and so they specialized in niching in a removalist company that was lgbtq friendly and when they niched they found that they got more money more referrals more revenue because it was a huge advantage or a huge niche that they had over their competition so really think about in this world where where can you niche yourself or what advantages can you have that are competitive to others and and the harder they are to replicate and then the higher the demand from from the customers the better and this is very strategic but it 's really important to think strategically before spending spending your budgets on something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways here to be different you could be cheaper than the rest or you could charge your services at a premium you could sell something for the same price as your competitors but but give them additional value you can have an additional service perhaps at education and training maybe it 's fitting for some of you maybe it 's not uh intellectual property that 's big for sole traders particularly uh consultants what could differentiate you would be your ip your adaptability so the benefit about small business is that where we 're adaptable we can shift and change very easily conveniently and then convenience such as a convenience store i think there 's a bp down the road for me it 's a two minute walk they sell milk for four dollars but i 'd rather buy it from them than the milk from way over there um i think my the nearest shopping center is about a good 15 20 minute walk and i 'll get the milk for two dollars but i 'd rather walk for two minutes and pay double the amount because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you as a business owner sort of find your differentiation find the way to be competitive in your industry really have a think about that before you go ahead and launch facebook ads next thing i 'd like to talk about is your avatar or your personal so that 's uh the fictional character i was telling you about um it 's always nice to come up with a name and the golden rule is you can 't have the same name as a client that you already know because it 's not even though that 's an ideal client that you might be thinking of it 's an amalgamation it 's a combination of all the clients that you are selling to it 's that client multiplied by a thousand so you put the name the age range the gender some businesses might be 50 50 50 men 50 women some might be 80 20 90 10 or some might be very one gender specific uh like the shaver club um and what what do people want from you is really important it 's a very critical uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can deliver value i know lots of people particularly in the technical field um some coaches uh some um yes some consultants really have maybe a disconnect with what they 're what they 're selling and how that 's communicating with the customer because of the technical word so if anyone here is very technical really have a think about how that 's sort of landing on your customer are they receptive do they understand and then the other thing to note is the pain points like really get in touch and really get connected with what people are going through so yeah that 's pretty much your persona i 'm just going to spend some time i hope the internet is okay i 'm just i 'm getting a few comments about my internet being a bit shaky just um courtney will let me know otherwise [Music] now where was i yes so oh so this is the different placement options um so a couple of you might know that um maybe four years ago now instagram has purchased facebook and whatsapp but before we delve into that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the business manager and i 'll take you in a little bit of a tour after uh but the that um so the facebook page is that thing where you can get likes and shares and follows most of you might have one but most people don 't know that there is a back-end interface to all of this where you can make more targeted and precise ads and really optimizing for sales not just likes and shares so i 'll show you what i mean by that i 've got some tabs open so most of you might have a page like this uh you know with some likes and some comments and shares and and some of you might be wondering or you might be putting a lot of these style events and going hey um i 'm not really making any sales out of this i 'm getting a whole bunch of likes and hearts and and comments and possibly shares but i 'm not getting any any sales whatsoever that 's because you 're optimizing when you run ads in this style you 're running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose it 's called it 's called our social proof and it 's more than anything a branding exercise so you may make a sale here and there but it 's not really targeted for for selling it 's targeted for for likes what most people don 't know is that there is a backend interface called the ads manager and it 's connected to your facebook page i know it 's a bit confusing but you 've got your personal facebook which you use in your own sort of personal day-to-day check out what your friends and family are up to your personal facebook is connected to the um to your facebook page and your facebook page is connected to the ads manager so the ads manager allows you to create more specifically targeted ads and i 'll just run you on a little bit of a tour and you want to create an ad here the first thing that facebook will ask you is what would you like to create uh would you like to create brand awareness or reach oh what 's it doing uh or would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website or have them install your app or even uh conversions uh which is a pixel event now i 'm going to touch into this in more detail but um installing a pixel is one of the greatest things you can do for your roi um so i 'm gonna go with conversions but it just depends on your goal if you want people to like your page or to comment on your post then you can by all means do this one you can also do lead generation if it 's something quick and easy if it involves more reading about it and getting to know the product i recommend conversions and and i mean i can answer more questions at the end about what sort of objective people are looking for um but anyway i 'll go ahead and i 'll start the ad this part here is will tell me about how much to spend and what sort of people i want to target so i 'm gonna go ahead and now i 've installed my pixel so i can tell the facebook oh maybe not i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them what countries or cities you can choose the whole world or you can choose australia or the us or even get city specific you can even have suburbs let 's say i want to target people only in the sydney cvd i just type in 2000 for the postcode and it 'll come up with the postcode here so you can get as narrow or as broad as as you like and over here you have the potential reach of people so that 's 460 000 which i think maybe facebook 's just been a bit too generous there um but you can also narrow down by age and gender so if you let 's edit the age let 's say i want people 30 plus and your placements oh before we do that you can also do uh detailed targeting so if i want to target what this works um if you want to target people that are interested in certain things you can find certain keywords here so this particular product is about happiness and gratitude and what i 'm going to do as well is i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond your detailed targeting selections when it 's likely to improve performance i 'm just going to untick that so i can get a more accurate reading of the population so there 's 170 000 people that are interested in this and live around the sydney cbd i might even broaden that to sydney city and it 'll come up with a bit of a radius um so that 's a million six hundred people um one million six hundred thousand people i should say and if i narrow that down further i 'm gonna put in let 's say people that enjoy yoga you can just keep playing with these keywords you can even look at the suggestions box and and just sort of um have a look through now what i meant by placement is you can choose where to put different things so uh facebook sport instagram and um whatsapp i don 't think whatsapp appears here um but they also partner up with different news articles or if you ever play games on your phone and you get a pop-up ad sometimes uh facebook partners up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i like to leave it in the default automatic placement because the the facebook algorithm will let me find the best people towards that particular goal and then on my daily budget i can shift it here let 's say instead of 20 i spend 50 dollars a day then this reach changes so i can see how many reach and conversions i can get out of this and then if i continue that i 'm just gonna check if there 's any questions about that while it loads uh can i create a separate personal facebook and business facebook so um your business facebook is completely different to your personal facebook um your personal facebook connects to your business facebook your business facebook doesn 't really reach anyone other than you know it does the advertising but it doesn 't really do it 's not really like a linkedin profile let 's say so you can do but i mean i recommend you have your personal facebook and have it connect to your business facebook um now i 'm not sure what it 's doing here but the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to run so my apologies my internet is not the best right now just if you could bear with me and uh feel free to send through any more questions i might just uh do this step real quick so i can show you the last step and um the other thing i should tell you in the meantime is some businesses um work really great on facebook particularly uh education or clothing and and so i always get answers time and time again what is the difference between facebook and google or which one 's better and it just depends on what industry you 're in to say um and it all depends because google 's goal is to answer questions so if say if your toilet breaks down you know your toilet 's broken down and you 're gonna go ahead and call a plumber that that is you definitely know but when it 's more like educational coaching services you 're not really sure it 's more like uh latent need is what we call it it 's more like a need in the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossroad where you 're like you know what i could use a personal trainer or i could use a coach um and then you give those people a call so facebook is more tailored around those sort of ads they generate a latent need in our um yeah in the back of our heads and and if your business is more around that model then it does really well whereas on google it 's more to answer a question so if people know they want to take salsa classes let 's say then google would be a great avenue but if they 're not really sure and they 're like yeah maybe i 'll try this salsa course might be good that 's the kind of style of ad we run so it 's not that one is better than the other they both have very different functions okay so now i 'm in the last bit i 'm creating my ad and you 've got here that you can add some media you can put some text and the url i 'm gonna add the media here and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of an example i 'm just gonna quickly add an image in here and you have a little preview bar and you can put some text here you just bear with me whoops that 's all capitalized can see here there 's a little preview bar that comes up and you can put some headline text and the website url and you then get a preview here of what the ad will look like and you have it under different placement options so that 's what it looks like on robot that 's what it looks like on desktop in the right hand column as well on instagram you can also have a look at what it looks like i think they 've even started putting them on instagram stories so yeah you get a whole feel of what it looks like and when you 're happy with all of that then you confirm and you run the ad i 'm just going to check if there 's any questions about that um is that i got one from flora is that a daily cost for one particular ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have that all under the same cost so that say you spend twenty dollars a day on the ad that twenty dollars will go to the best performing ad um the the one that the facebook algorithm deems the most popular how do i link google ads with facebook asks peter um well peter you they 're they 're two completely different entities you just don 't link them together you either run google ads or you run facebook ads you can track everything that comes into your website with something like google analytics and then it can tell you where the weather traffic is coming from it 's coming from facebook or google i 've got one from terry here how do you find out the customer 's interest so you can target them properly uh it you know what this is just a fine art like it just i i cannot give you an answer a lot of it is testing and learning um that 's what we call it in marketing the test and we learn and stuff we just keep on trying different things and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lowering then you know you 're targeting a more sort of precise specific customer um anna says i find facebook doesn 't like pictures with words they rejected this is true um they used to completely ban them completely but now you get really heavily penalized i think there 's um a 20 uh facebook policy where 20 percent of the ad up to twenty percent must be covered in text anything above that um it will get really heavily penalized you can check this um you can click on this thing here you can find it on google it 's called the the facebook uh grid checker facebook grid checker and it 's a tool that that will you upload the image and then it will tell you whether it 's got too much text and to sort of change it around or whether it 's got enough text for it to be acceptable the the ideal thing that you want to do is have less text rather than more so you can update a file here and it will tell you um whether it 's appropriate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps and i hope i answered the questions for flora and peter i hope that made sense for you both and thank you terry and anna i 'll just move on with the rest of the slide there yeah so you 've got those uh placement options you 've got news articles whatsapp instagram apps and facebook itself when you 're advertising and over time you 'll know where the best traffic is coming from it just needs to take some again testing and learning um generally i find the best traffic doesn 't come from facebook and instagram itself um but yeah it depends and now last but not least i 'm going to touch on the facebook pixel um and so what is what is this facebook pixel that everyone seems to be talking about have you ever had that experience where you find something you like on a facebook ad and you click on it let 's say it 's back to that show example so you see a pair of shoes that you like and then you find that every time you log into facebook that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following you it 's like it 's it 's almost creepy right i 'm sure most of you have had that experience right so that 's what the facebook pixel is it 's uh it 's a little piece of code that people stick into their websites um it 's not visible to the naked eye and it 's a code that tells facebook and so has been here now as advertisers or small business owners we can 't tell hey it 's uh you know it 's john john green from down the road we wouldn 't be able to tell that information but what we can tell is that we 've had a visitor and someone has visited us that fits our profile or that we ran some facebook advertising and they went into the website so we can run another ad and it 's called a remarketing ad where those people that have visited the website but have not completed a purchase they can get retargeted again and again until they finally do usually the window of retargeting is about seven days so the ad keeps following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying something i mean have you ever gone um online shopping or clicked on an ad and then you sort of go maybe not i won 't buy it and you close the ad most people don 't actually purchase on their first first time they visit the shop normally it takes a little bit and they say on average it takes seven touch points so people have uh on average about seven interactions with the ad until they decide to finally purchase so that 's what the pixel does it does it enables retargeting or remarketing so you can re-target your customers and it also allows you to measure so you can calculate how many people have purchased from facebook and what they 've purchased which is great because then you can really get to know uh what your return on investment is coming from facebook and the other thing that it does when i was working in the big company we ran extensive research on the facebook pixel and i didn 't believe it i thought it was a load of rubbish i i just i didn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was just sending people um onto the website for clicks and the other one was the pixel uh the pixel ad that was sending people to the same website but the pixel was optimizing um so the pixel it does this sort of artificial intelligence machine learning thing that it takes people who fit your persona the most into a purchase and they keep learning about you and when we ran this ad we found statistically significant data saying that the facebook pixel ads were far more effective than just sending people into clicks they really had or facebook really has some sort of algorithmic algorithmic magic that they do to send people as many people as possible into that purchase event or that purchase page so we found that the pixel is really such an amazing thing probably one of the best things that facebook 's done and all the other social media uh sites uh try to copy it but facebook 's the most effective in terms of its regression and artificial intelligence so thank you so much for listening to this webinar i 'm just going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i here we go yeah great um i mean feel free i 've answered some some of the questions but feel free to um send some through thank you so much yes you could offer um such a great uh presentation uh like yes you can mention please put um any other further questions you have in the chat box um so i recommend we take the time uh to quiz uh yes cal while we have her here um while we wait for a couple of more questions to come through jessica i actually have a question um of my own so what happens if i am getting like a lot of likes and shares on my business page but they aren 't converting what would you suggest are you using their you know their social profile or are you using the ads manager at the back end just the social side yeah then i 'd recommend you install the ads manager and and the pixel and then run ads in that style yeah definitely yeah um and then how do i know um that it 's been being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the thing that 's so critical is to set it up properly i know lots of businesses don 't do that even the giant funnily enough they they don 't set it up to haven 't measured their roi but the important thing is to have that the pixel set up properly um it might be a bit of an investment but i always tell people that it 's expensive to not have this set up um i think yeah it generally costs money it 's a very technical thing um but you can you can see the roi on facebook and and how it performs so you can look at what you 've been spending and how much you 've been making out of those ads set up correctly yeah okay perfect uh so we had a question come through from flora so it doesn 't mean that facebook ad will go through to instagram at the same time yes that 's correct so when you do um when you do these sort of paid ads in the backend system in the ads manager instagram is another sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're doing the the more social side the likes and shares or looking at your facebook page then you have to post them separately um when it comes to that sort of platform i hope that makes sense flora all right perfect uh so we got one through from anna so uh she says i use instagram more than facebook but i run ads through facebook is this a disadvantage um i guess it depends and if you 're running um if you 're running these for free like you 're posting them up or you 're actually sort of putting money behind them but i would say that it depends on your goal enough okay so if you 're looking for sales then i would um i would definitely be running them in their ads manager rather than boosting them on instagram because if you boost them on instagram it 's uh it 's tailored for likes and maybe visits to your profile or your website but i 've not seen it as of today to convert into sales so definitely um see how you go setting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh so we have one from caroline so do you offer a service that connects the facebook pixel money set up but i don 't think requires tweaking oh but you but it i think it requires okay um yeah so done sorry um you know one thing that you can do carolyn is you can go on if you 've got google chrome you can go in and find this tool called the facebook pixel helper i 'll show you what i mean um how do i um how do i close this for oh there we go um so if i 'm on chrome here you see here that i 've got this little chrome extension you can literally google it it 's called facebook pixel helper and it helps you to view all the pixels so if we go into a website um let 's go into the happy gratitude journal whoops you can tell when it stops being gray and it shows up something in blue that means that it 's got a pixel there so if i click on it i can see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your competitors as well whether or not they have their pixel in place um so you can have a look go through your own website and download the facebook pixel helper that might be that might give you a hand but otherwise you can speak to one of the advices and we 'll be happy to to go through it with you as well perfect all right thank you so much jessica uh for this presentation i 'll just check the chat box um so we had one more question come through from peter um so he 's got uh can i create a separate personal facebook and business facebook yeah so um they they are separate entities anyway um i think i i didn 't i don 't feel like i did a great job answering that one but um i 'll show you what i mean so this is your facebook page um and your personal page is oops i 'm just gonna move this here so this is my personal page which is you know where i speak to my friends and do all my social things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it looks like then you 've got your your business uh you know your business page and that is connected to your ads manager so they 're they 're all different sort of entities all together if that makes sense so they 're all going to be separate anyway but they 're all going to be connected to your uh personal account i hope that answers your question perfect okay well it seems like we 've got through all the questions jessica is there anything you 'd like to mention before we close up the session um i guess uh just if you 've got any queries about facebook or about setting up anything that involves paid advertising i 'm more than happy to have a conversation feel free to book a time where we can have a really clear look and see what sort of road map or blueprint best fits your own business model so feel free to reach out and thank you so much for listening to me everyone thank you jessica so just before we close up the session i just want to mention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are brought to you by the city of ride and funded by new south wales treasury uh for small business month so on the 19th of october from 11 to 12 we have if you sell to other businesses linkedin is the profile to use and then on the 26th of october we have

    "text": "hi everyone and welcome to freestyle drama this is a special drama video made for ride Council and ride library and today we 're going to be looking at a few drama games and exercises just to get warmed up into the holes or a creative mode and we 're going to make some other videos and that will post online that will cover filmmaking so including script writing the filming and editing and things like that so I 'm glad you can join us now when they 're doing drama dramas all about telling stories and and creation okay and creating so we want to use our bodies in our voices so it 's important to warm those up so the first thing we 're gonna do then you shake your face yeah free and relaxed feeling nice and warm now the other thing we want would like to warm up is our boys of course we can we can use their voice to create characters and tell stories so I could talk like so one way to warm our voices up into practice saying words is tongue twisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and say that sound off slow and then we sort get a little bit faster red leather yellow leather red leather yellow leather red leather yellow leather red leather red leather yellow leather red liver Unilever in there when it gets a bit tricky after a little while another one 's an old one is she sells seashells by the seashore Here I am at the sensual she sells seashells by the seashore she sells seashells by the seashore she sells seashells by the seashore she sells seashells by the seashore she sells seashells by the seashore she gets hard at the faster you go yep okay so my voice is feeling quite warm now when we 're making stories we use characters you know they 're Shrek and Superman there 's a lot lots of different characters so it 's fun to actually pretend that you 're some of those characters and if you 've got costumes at home you can use those though we 're just gonna go make up a funeral characters and warm our bodies up a little put bit more so let 's start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go okay little astronaut on the moon another one is baby let 's try being a baby learning to walk okay another one you could to add zombie there are so pretend remember drama is just about telling stories it 's not real we 're just having a bit of fun okay so we 're happy everyone 's feeling nice and warm and ready to go we 're going to do a few more exercises I 'm gonna be back in just a second hi there and welcome back to more freestyle drama as you can see my background has changed yes I 'm using a green screen and with a green screen you can put lots of different images in the background and you can be anywhere I could be on the moon or underwater or at the beach so here I am now we 're gonna start doing a few more drama games and exercises our first game we 're gonna try is it 's just called its rates now I 'm going to remind something out you got try and guess what it is okay so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's right if it gets guitar spot on we 'll keep it a bit more musical playing the drums a guitar ear drums that 's right try this one okay now when you 're minding things because we 're using our bodies when we 're using drama it 's good to give it like a hundred percent to give it all your energy and that 's way the audience are going to feel what you 're doing as well okay this time I 'm going to do something a little bit different fish that 's right I was using a fishing rod okay yeah something a little bit different basketball we 're starting to do a bit of sport and stuff now that 's right so you can create anything you can do anything and a good game to have with your friends or if you 're with a group is you test each other out have a bit of a game do something and see if they can guess what you 're doing okay now up to a bit more of an exercise but we 're gonna do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts at different things and one of those could be the excellent expert of making funny faces so you can try a few different ones or you could be the expert old standing still and see how long you can do it for or you can be the expert of being an angry mom or dad oh you could be an expert making sounds like we get abused to get ready to warm up and so we start thinking about how to make things all right I 'm just gonna duck out my sort of change my background we 'll see here we go we 're back in space that 's right changed again just like magic so now we 're gonna start thinking about how we create spory so you can come up with lots of different ideas you know there 's princes and princesses and Dragons and superheroes and baddies so you a good way to do it is just just start telling a story so if you have a bit of a theme so for example you could have a theme of a princess and a pirate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do one sentence at a time so for example you son once upon a time there was a princess who was kidnapped by a pirate on the high seas they sailed for many many days until they were shipwrecked so that 's one sentence and then if you 're with another group someone else could have a turn I gave a turn and I can pretend to be something different when they woke up the next day they were on a beach they didn 't know where they were it was an island and they started searching the island for food and water and that 's another person 's turn and then someone else could have a turn and go the princess tried to escape and she ran but then she came to the edge of a waterfall and she jumped and someone else 's turn or back to the start if you like she jumped him the two of the pool but there was piranhas in the pool so she had to swim and then she got out of the pool there was the pirate waiting for her but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all these different you just can keep going with a story and adding it on and adding it on and you can try you can do different sort of costume changes you can add cost you hats different things like that but you can add all these things so I 'm just gonna change and I 'm back changed again you can change costume even got my special helicopter hat make it you can see my cap is a bit green so it becomes the background as well see how cool is that yes so I was thinking we could just make up a little television commercial a little a TV ad now basically what you need to do is something that you want can be anything you know if you 're a kid maybe you want someone to do your homework you know without telling mom or anybody else you know and they do your homework perfectly every time so for example you could start off like this oh I to do my homework and then do you need someone to do your well we have the brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special robot stays in your room and it just turns out all the homework you need no time let us give you a little example what is your homework mathematics okay one and one is two two and two is four four and four is eight eight and eight is eight and eight is battery don 't worry about that one that 's an old model I 'll get you the brand new model that works just fine so if you wanna just call nine nine nine four three two four seven six five four three two one be your robot homework doer okay that will do it is great it does all my homework every day and so I have all my free time to go skate boy movies and play games but don 't tell mom okay another game that we like to play when we 're warming up for drama is called entrances now this is where you do a little scene by yourself and you just imagine that you 're in a certain place so you could be at a police station or a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene straight away I 'm gonna give you an exam this is going to be in a haunted house okay and I 'm gonna be like coming in out of the rain into the haunted house and I have to imagine on right there straight away so watch this now I 'm gonna be in exactly the same position but I 'm gonna be a different character I 'm gonna be so I 'm gonna be a Ghostbuster he 's going in to catch these ghosts okay I just have a little look at this one Oh ghosts ghosts come he goes I got a surprise for you can hear them Oh ghost I 'm so scared why don 't you come and scare me oh there 's a ghost around Gani or we could help set up the scene where you 're in the police station so for example you 've seen an accident and you come in and you tell the police officer what you seen like this I 've just seen a car accident outside on the street I don 't think anyone 's dead or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come and give me a help please please follow me another exercise you could do is it 's pretending you 're sick in to see because acting is all about you know telling a story or convincing somebody that something is true so you can pretend that you 're sick and see if your dad believes there can be a little exercise you can do it 's always good to have some other people to play with and create and their stories and dramas as well but if you 're on your own you can do a few little different exercises for example you can pretend that you have a pet with you so you 're taking them for a walk or for it you know it 's like let 's go Fifi this is a little game I call breaking news it 's like you can come up with any breaking news you like you know for example you know where my pet dog ate my homework or something like that but you can make it sort of big and you 've got to give the energy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who are watching have a look at this one ladies and gentlemen I have breaking news my name is Roger Davis and Here I am at the beach because a tsunami is on its way it 's out to sea and it 's gonna come in so with everybody you have to get out of here get away from the beach go climb the mountain Lord go up to a skyscraper or something like that but please get out of here I 'm gonna save myself by this game is called fairytale in a minute now it 's a tricky one because you 've got to try and tell a whole fairy tale in one minute or less trying to get all the characters in and all the main action so let 's see if you 're gonna have to go I 'm gonna give you a little demonstration okay here is my fairy tale in a minute see if you can guess [Music] okay yes oh okay granny you okay yes thanks to you hunter you 're welcome just doing my job so yes did you gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now an important part of drama is expressing your feelings or emotions at characters II sometimes happy sad excited so a fun game to play is called emotional corners so you could start off in one corner and you pick an emotion let 's say sad so a good way to to make you feel sad is to think of something that makes you say it so for example if I am the ice cream and then you changing you run to the other corner over here and then you think of something another feeling like excited so I imagine if I [Music] [Music] [Music] that can be a fun way to start showing emotions for your character show their feelings and see how they see how they are in a scene so yes that is emotional corners so that 's all we have time for today it was just an overview of drama gains and exercises to start thinking about how we can create story and performances we have some upcoming videos that are gonna cover filmmaking about how we write the script get our characters and story together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on simon freestyle and we 'll see you again soon"

    "text": "hi everyone and welcome to our final installment of our special drama in filmmaking video workshops for the ride library in this workshop obviously I 'm going to be going through editing a film on an iPad using iMovie and I 'll also show you how you can upload your film to YouTube if you wish now the important thing about YouTube is it has to be you your own creation not taken from anybody else 's work and then you can place it and you can also place it privately it doesn 't have to be for public view so you can share it with your friends ok let 's get down to it so the first thing we do when we 're editing on an iPad is we want to open our editing app our program called iMovie and iMovie is here it 's the purple square with the white star and there 's a little camera inside so we press that and then when we 're going to make here we go with our editing the first thing we 're going to do when we edit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program and it 's the purple box with the white star and a little camera inside so we tap on that and that should open up a projects page okay and when we 're going to make a new video or film we press + and then we 're going to make a movie trailer is a another thing altogether so we 're just gonna make a movie so we press movie now it shows you the most recent films that you 've been working on that 's all the clips that you have there they 're called moments there 's videos you can add photos and albums but we 're going to create a movie so down the bottom we 're gonna go down there and create movie now this is our our canvas this is our a place where we we make things happen so down the bottom here is called the timeline and here is where we can view the the media or the footage that we 're going to use and up here is where we choose what we 're going to put in our timeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we press we we want to get our video so we go there now we 're gonna choose recently added there 's all these other options there 's different albums and selfies and different things that we can use but we 're gonna choose recently added so we tap on that now in recently added the last thing that you build is at the top which means the first thing that you filmed is down the bottom and that 's all the footage that we 've taken to make this film so sometimes it is a process of going through all the footage and what you want to do is try and find the very first clip okay now as I was saying in the last video when we 're filming sometimes we would do a scene and we do several takes take one take two and the last take is usually at the top so let 's have a look and see if this take here is looks like the first scene so you click on it tap on it and there should be when you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside and that means we can do things so here we can preview it which means this little arrow here we play it and it 'll play okay so you can pause it now that is the first clip that we want to use so we 're going to bring it down into our timeline and to do that we press + you can see the plus there and then that comes down and that is the start of our film now there 's a bit of a gap here before the character enters so we can stop it just you can use your finger to sort of slide up and down the clip this is the clip in the timeline and that 's where we want it to start so what we do is we put the line up where we want it tap the screen and again the yellow box will come around which means we can do work on the clip and what we want to do here down the bottom we have actions Speed titles volume and filters first thing we 're going to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clip we press split so I 'm going to press split and that shows you it 's cut now this is the one I don 't want so I 've got a tap on that one to make sure the yellow light border is around it and then I can tap put it in the garbage bin chuck it in the bin delete down the bottom there I press that and it 's gone alright so that 's where we want it to start okay and again when the character leaves we want to cut it just after they leave so that 's where it is I tap on the screen press split again and I don 't that 's the the fit I don 't want these in yellow so I can work with it I 'm gonna chuck it in the bin down there and it 's gone now the volumes okay but I 'm it might help to have it a little bit louder so I can press volume in the middle there so I 'm gonna press volume and I can I can mute it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can increase it so if it 's a bit quiet you can turn it up you can turn it all the way up to 500 but at 500 the sound gets a bit distorted it gets a bit rougher so usually less is okay I 'm just going to go to about 200% so let 's check that so the sound sounds okay but what I want to do there is Pisces going in for a swim I want to add a sound effect there so I 'm going to go to audio and in audio we 've got music there 's different sort of movie that you can use but I don 't want to I want some sound effects for this one and I want to see there 's lots of different ones there 's bubbles car skidding but what I want is a water splash you can test it and then you press use and that comes in there so let 's just take them and their works well alright so that 's our first scene you know to go back and get our next clip we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film Fugees so we go up there and the next clip let 's have a look I think that 's that clip there so that 's the clip we want so we press + bring it down now we don 't want the first bit oh there he comes up there we go and there go to actions again so you just go back and press actions and then split we don 't want that part press on it and delete it let 's just see that transition now in between the clips we have what we call transitions now this is a dissolve which is sort of one seen sort of dissolves into the next scene you can do a slide or a wipe a fade or a theme or none at all it can be just a rough cut so if we do none it jumps very quickly what I might do is actually put a fade too so we can see the difference fades and then he comes we want to stop it there we 're on action so we want to split it and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the volume up a little bit there as well so that sounds alright now we can always pause it and we just slide it across when we want to go to the end our next clips involve a phone call it 's when the when Jeff character calls the police saying that he 's lost Percy which means we won 't need to cut between the two of them we don 't have to split it you can put your finger on the end of the just make sure it 's in yellow just gently on the end and you can bring it in and move it up and down a little bit so let 's just check where we want it to start about there so it 's just bringing in just a little bit and you can see there where the lips move when is actually starting so you can sync that up like that and here 's the police footage now that we took a few takes here so the first two probably alright I 'm gonna pick this one I 'm gonna bring that down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down you can check it in the timeline because you can delete which parts you don 't want so I 'm just going to check all right so that 's the police answering the phone that 's the part I want to go be when he 's answering the call so I 'm gonna split it there now I want this clip to go before the other part so what I 'm gonna do is I put my finger on it and I can raise it and move it along and bring it down in there so actually I 'm going to I want it to be at before Jeff is on the phone so so I bring it up again and then bring it in there so let 's just check that we want that now there 's a bit at the beginning I wanted to keep and I cut it out accidentally so what I can do is I tap on the yellow again and I can return the bit that I 've missed so let 's see if that 's if I got everything and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have the time so already there 's we 've got two and a half minutes of footage already so this could be about five minutes maybe more a bit of interaction they 'll bring in the first part the first character is the the market seller and then we 'll bring down bring down Jeff 's response so that 's a question and we want to get Jeff 's response so we 'll bring Jeff down here bring that back over so we lift that up and we bring it across and if you just bring it to the edge it will slide a little bit you 're just got to do it gently all right what 's going there as he 's landing in the water it might be good to have a bit of a sound effect so we go back to audio press sound effects and then remember the last one was a water splash that 's the one there let 's use it now the water spray you can move the water splash the sound a little bit across so even during the transition you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on film sets now is is in the water a lot so we can probably use the water splashing again so he starts to swim now there 's something you can play around we can actually change the speed of the clips if we if you look here we have speed so you can press that and we can actually either speed it up there 's a little rabbit symbol or slowed it down there 's a turtles so let 's see what it looks like if we speed it up it changes the whole sound of the words and everything so let 's have a look [Music] so yeah he 's starting to sound like a leprechaun there or we can slow it down which changes it again let 's try this one and it actually makes the clip longer if you can see that let 's try that all right so the light here is a bit bright it 's played a bit and we 'll cut off a little bit there so that 's probably not the best one we tried this one it 's better light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll we 'll put that one in there we might need to turn up the volume a little bit so I can hear it better now that sets up the fact that the baddie will be appearing on the scene soon so that 's the flying carpet attacks the body so we can put a sound effect in there like we have the jet flyby I believe that can cut sound effects as well so we just need it up to there that 's our essential film now this is what we call a rough cat wall it 's a little bit more than a rough cut because I 've added bits to it but it has all the clips that make up the film all in there from the beginning into the end and that 's what we call a rough cut and now the final cut which is where we put in all all our sound effects we put out titles in now we can put a title at the beginning now you can either put a title over the clip yeah I 'm going to just split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to put there and we 'll show you we can put a title over a clip so I 'm gonna you press t2 and the bottom there and press title and you have all these different options there 's gravity reveal line title I 'm gonna try line title and you can see you can put it in the center or lower and it goes there all right and then you tap on the screen and you can delete delete that and then we 're going to call it the penguin and that 's done and then on the second taper and we have that so we can see that little little prop up the penguin occasion put the title in there now if you want to add another title to a blank screen you can make your own blank screen you can you can do something like put your finger over the the lens here and use the camera and record and that gives you a blank screen and then you go back into your iMovie and you go to video recently added we 've only just done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it down and then you tap on that one and then you press titles again this time I 'm going to go with standards so I 'm gonna go now I don 't want the text e so I delete that good that 'll start our film what 's I 'm gonna split that one and then this one I want to keep going so I 'm gonna press duplicate and then I can move it next to it and then I can duplicate that one and move it next to it now we can put some titles at the animal credits let 's put some credits in there we 'll go to you can put starring and there 's your credits and at the front here that 's our film edited we can put the name of the film here and we delete that my movie 7 and we 're going to call it the penguin caper done and then when so it 's shows us 6 minutes 40 seconds and we made it today 2nd of July and we can play it back now we can play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I don 't want to do that all the way through and we can delete it if we really wanted to and we can also save it we can save the video and we can do a large I 'm gonna do HD which is High Definition don 't do that one and it saves it to your camera roll and when it 's saved a sign comes up and says the movie was exported to your photo library your camera roll

    "text": "hi everyone and welcome back to freestyle drama today we 're going to be moving along to our filmmaking video and to start off with we 're going to look at how we write a script okay all stories movies books etc come up have to start with an idea okay so we 're going to look at how we create an idea and then how we format that into a script for a movie a short film or whatever we want to do because we can look at making a television commercial or a breaking news story or just a little story that you want to make okay so we can make a story about anything we like you know we could talk about a story about going to the moon or an underwater adventure or even crossing the desert to see the pyramids so to get our brains going in active we 're going to play a little game it 's a bit like a game show okay so if you want you can buzz in you can have your own pretend buzzer or a bing or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask a series of questions and you chime in and give me your answers okay are you ready question number one name something that is blue question number two name something that lives in the sky might be a bit of a trick question that one question number three name an african animal good and question number four name a character from a fairy tale and question number five name your favorite book that might be an easy one sometimes it 's not so easy to think of a favorite one okay so question number one something that 's blue could be my shirt or the sky something that lives in the sky a bird a plane when it 's flying lives in the sky an african animal lots of lions and elephants and things like that favorite fairy tale i think um snow white and the seven dwarfs and my favorite book is a book called the famous five go on adventure that 's an old book okay so we 're going to start looking at how we start our ideas and a good idea is to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodie or a baddie or could be yourself okay and in a location so you think where are they are they on a on the moon are they on a desert island are they on a ship sailing across the seven seas okay so it 's a good idea to start thinking about those and where they are now the whole format is going to be in three parts it 's it doesn 't have to be but it 's a good place to start so part one is the beginning it 's like the hello so who are they and where are they okay so it could be a princess in a hot air balloon all right and then part two is a problem so for any good story we need some sort of problem so for example if the princess is in a hot air balloon perhaps the balloon starts to go down and none of the controls are working in the hot air balloon and then part three is the resolution so what happens in the end does the balloon start to go up again does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of different versions the the great thing about making stories and making films is you can write whatever you like okay i 'm going to start thinking about writing some of my ideas down maybe you 'd like to get a pen and paper and you can start writing your ideas how to i 'll be right back hi and welcome back to our script writing session later on we 'll be looking at a few characters and maybe making a television commercial to go with our film and the breaking news item about what the film is about so to start off with let 's get down and just think about what do we want to write about okay do you want to write about a princess or someone about yourself who gets in trouble a superhero might save you now it could be it could be an astronaut on the moon okay can can be anything that you want so let 's start off with you know what are we going to write i 'm going to write i 've got pen and paper and i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters i think i 'm gonna be a kid i 'm gonna be a kid and i have a penguin a penguin named percy okay now so where do i live i think i live i live near the beach okay live near the beach because percy likes water okay so that 's our part one okay our starting point it 's a film about a kid um what 's my character name going to be so it 's a good idea to come up with a character name my character name is going to be jeff i 'm going to be jeff jeff drink water because i like to drink water jeff drink water and percy the penguin okay so we live by the beach so that 's where we are and who we are so that is part one now part two is for any story we usually there 's some problem okay um the princess gets kidnapped or you know the stepmother tries to poison her or something like that now if i 'm going to think about what 's your what 's your character what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter a baddie okay so in lots of good stories there 's a baddie the evil stepmother the wicked witch yeah there 's different characters you know there 's a big bad wolf for one is another one okay so um a character in my story i think is going to be a a secret agent an evil secret agent evil secret agent and his name is umbrella i 'm gonna call him umbrella because he 's always hiding behind umbrellas okay his name 's umbrella spy jacket he is going to kidnap to kidnap my penguin because he thinks it has some secret information in its collar okay secret info in his collar that 's not right what 's happened is it 's a case of mistaken identity there 's another penguin who is transporting some information in their collar and they happen to be going through our beach at the same time and this umbrella spy jacket is going to take my penguin by mistake hmm so what am i going to do there i 'm going to tell the police yep i 'm going to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're you know in investigating lots of crimes so they may not be able to help me so i i tell the police they 'll do their best but they can 't actually help me so as i 'm walking home and i 'm worried and i 'm a bit nervous and i 'm scared for percy i walk through some markets and as i 'm walking through the markets there 's a a man who 's selling flying carpets yeah i like flying carpets and he says he 's giving a special offer they must go only ten dollars for a flying carpet and i happen to have twelve dollars in my pocket so i buy a flying carpet because it might help me find percy okay so i go home and on my phone i have a tracking device a tracking device and because percy has a little computer chip in its collar and it tells me where he is and i realize that percy has been taken to a desert island far away so the only way i can get there is by flying lucky i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag and i take some snacks and then some water because i 'm gonna need water and i fly on my flying carpet to rescue percy okay so that is all tied up in the problem percy 's been kidnapped where have they gone they 've gone that way the police can 't help me so i 'm gonna go and do it on my own all right so i set off on my flying carpet but as i 'm i 'm i 'm not used to flying the flying carpet and as i come close to the island i actually fall off and fall in the water so then i have to swim to the shore and as i 'm swimming to the shore sharks chase me so i have to chase i have to swim so fast to get away from the sharks and then um what happens on the island so this is the start of the end okay this is the resolution okay so what happens okay so i use my phone to track percy and i find that he 's in a cave on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i get percy in the cave and i rescue him but just then some alarms go off and i have to run and as i 'm running i fall down the beach but then just at the last moment as umbrella is coming towards us my trusty flying carpet comes and picks us up and takes us all the way home and where we are safe so in the end so that 's what happens i managed to rescue percy in the end hmm what do you think about that how 's your story coming so so let 's recap have you thought of your character who are the characters going to be okay do you have a what we can call them a hero okay or heroine if it 's a a girl um and what happens to them what is the problem where are they are they at home or are they on the moon or they at the beach and what is the problem is a tsunami coming are they trapped on the moon and the spaceship 's not working and they 're running out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescued does a superhero come along maybe you 've got a costume at home and you can dress up as a superhero and then do they come and rescue you or do you manage to save yourself and yeah so and do is there a kidnapping has someone taking something of yours maybe it 's your your your treasure maybe you have something very special that someone takes from you and you 're trying to rescue that okay or get it back it could be just as simple as your brother or sister has taken you know your your favorite top or you know pants or something and you go on a mystery tour to find out where it 's gone and then in the end you find them in your brother or sister 's room now speaking of brothers and sisters you may want you know to use some other characters now i 'm going to show you how you can be one actor and play all the different characters or you can get some help from mum or dad who could be a character dad could play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have brothers and sisters who play different characters you can use costume you can use hats tops if you 've got superhero outfits if you 've got any sort of costume you might have a princess dress you might have a superman or spiderman costume and you could dress up in that and you could film yourself so and there 's so many different devices you can film on you know i 'll be using an ipad today and in another video i 'll be showing you how to edit the ipad so you can use that some people have phones you can film on a phone or if you have a little movie camera okay you can film on that and the program i 'll be using is imovie so yes well and but some people might have a different editing program or you might just be able to film each part so that they follow on from each other and perhaps you don 't have to edit so much at all okay so i 'm going to be right back i 'm going to have a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different characters that we can be okay i 'll be back in a moment hi everyone and welcome back i 've just made a scene list of the scenes i want to shoot for my film from the script i talked about already i 've called it the penguin caper now part one of our scripting is the the setup it 's like who and where so that 's just seen one at the beach and then from scene two that 's where the problem starts percy goes missing umbrella kidnaps i buy the flying carpet i track percy i fall off the carpet down there and then scene six i swim away from the sharks to the island now from scene seven that is the start of the the resolution the ending it 's the beginning of the ending so i find percy in the cave umbrella the baddie chases us and then we escape on the flying carpet and that is our our final ending we escape and live happily ever after so yes there we have our our scene shot and our whole outline of our script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call dialogue and dialogue is when the characters talk to each other so what do they say to each other and it doesn 't have to be too too complicated or anything we can keep it simple so for example you know you could have my character and the percy the penguin walking down the beach and the jeff says you know i i love living by the beach and percy can you know nod or say yes and and that can be it all right and then um then you find the the other what the other characters say their dialogue and so you you write that down so it 's a good idea to have that sort of mapped out um in advance so everyone knows and especially if you 're using different actors they know what they 're going to say some people can just make it up on the spot but it 's also it 's it is a good idea to write the script down so i 'll show you a little example of that so here is an example of how we write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put if it 's inside or outside so if it 's outside we say exterior and put ext if it 's inside we put interior we can put int and then at the beach daytime and then we put the character jeff says their line hey percy i love living near the beach how about you and percy uh if you want to show an action that the actor does we put it in brackets like that okay so percy can not his head because he doesn 't say not his head and then says hmm or how a penguin would say and then you go through and you write a script for your all the other scenes or the the dialogue for all the other scenes and it doesn 't you don 't have to follow it exactly you know you can change it actors are often change the lines of the script because they feel better for the character to say so but yes it 's good to have a good outline of you know what each character says hi everyone and welcome back now i 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you can make some different characters now if you 've got a few friends or you can use your family you can ask them to be characters in your film but if you don 't have all other people then you can you can make the characters yourself you can change your your your voice you can go oh you can change your voice a bit like that and you can change your whole body you can turn into a completely different person this is like i 'm an old man well i 'm a bit older anyway but not quite that old okay and by the way this is percy who 's going to be starring in our film so yes i 'm going to be filming the actual script that we 've made today in our next video and in the final video we 'll be editing and i 'll show you how to edit on imovie on an ipad okay so that 's percy it 's going over there now just a quick change and then i 'll show you how we can make so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing that shows a different character you cover that up and with a simple hat like that i become the police officer yes we 're going to do all we can to get your penguin back we 're on the job so you can do that one all right and then our baddie good old umbrella spy jacket here 's my spy jacket okay again zip it up so we don 't see the shirt from the other character we can put the hoodie up and some sunglasses and it 's like i 'm going to get that penguin i am going to get the information and nobody is going to stop me don 't panic it 's just me yep so there 's lots of little things that you can do costume wise you can put on a superhero costume if you 've got a superhero in there and or you can just wear your own clothes if you 're going to be your own character so that 's about all we have for today for our scripting video and character video thank you for watching this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our actual filming of our script and then the editing and also watch out for our the drama video that 's already posted online see you soon you"

    "text": "hi everyone and welcome back to freestyle drama this is our third film for ride library and this bill will be covering our filming process about cameras where we position things shot sizes all that sort of thing and a few techniques and tips to help you along with the filming job hi back again just to show you what a stand looks like this is a tripod okay it 's got three legs that 's why is his try and we have a mount here that fits on top of the tripod like that and we have a microphone that plugs into the side of the iPad here and the microphone really helps the quality of the sound as well okay so that 's the setup now that the main reason a tripod and mount is a good idea is because it gives stability is this just a shot you can actually you can move it up and down okay and you adjust this you can move it side to side as well and it keeps the shot stable now if your hand hold it by hands what can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which is okay if you 're filming an earthquake that 's a great idea or a crash or something like that but yeah if you want a general shot yeah you want to be able to see it clearly and that 's why when it 's stable it 's the best idea if you can 't do that you can find simple things to use some books or a cup and prop your iPad like that and you can press the reverse button so it reverses this way and it films you and then you press record you can put it down and then it will see you now you 're you 've got to think about what shots you want to use a close-up is like mainly of the face so you want to see their emotions a mid shot is mainly what we use today which is like half the body and then a wide shot is like showing you where people are of the island and you know wide open spaces or a building or something like that I hope that helps I live near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good swim when you 're filming it 's a good idea to to follow some rules about letting the actors know when they 're going to be filmed so if you 've got someone who can operate the camera now it 's a good idea if you ever and a director it 's a good idea for them to give some signals to communicate when the filming show shall start now the usual way that we do this on a film set is light camera action but what we we the first thing we should do is let people know what scene were up to so we 're gonna shoot scene 1 and we say scene 1 take 1 and then if that 's not quite a good take we might need to do it again if we make a mistake again so what 's a scene 1 take 2 and scene one take three sometimes they take it takes a lot of takes because of the mistakes usually the last one is the best one but not always so it 's a good idea to get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the know so you let everyone know first thing you should do is let it will ask it want to be quiet because we need everyone to be silent on the set so we say quiet on set scene one take two and then the director should be able to say action in three and that lets the actors know it 's time to do their performance we give up we keep it silent because when we 're editing which way I 'll show you in there our next video you need to be the space to move Clips around and and merge them together so it 's always good to have a bit of space there so that 's why the last one will do three two and the one is silent though it helps with the editing but everyone knows so here you can see I 'm in front of the green screen and are we using the green screen to show lots of different backgrounds I 'll be at the beach and flying on a carpet now it 's a green screen can be handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an app called be scope or do ink on an iPad and that that allows you to use whatever photo you have on the iPad you can use for your green screen workshop and it looks like I quit your whining you 're coming with me when you 're filming it 's a good idea to have the light behind the camera so the light is actually on the subject in this case me so you can see the actor or the character more clearly if the light was behind me then I would sort of be it would be a bit shadowy and a bit darker and not so clear and also with sound if you have a microphone that 'd be great but if you don 't you can probably tell if I come closer you can hear me a lot better but if I 'm sort of too far away it 's more difficult to hear and Plus this other sounds like planes and birds and traffic and things like that only please yeah yeah my name is Jeff and I 've lost my penguin yeah yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went you went for a swim there he always comes back and you never come back he 's next Percy he 's my best friend I really want him back okay okay well he 's gray black flippers yeah okay thank you oh you can also plan your shots so say now I 'm giving into the character of the bad of umbrella spy jacket and I could do all his scenes at the same time so I could even though they are not in order though I could do scene 1 and scene 4 because they 're both for the same character I don 't have to do it in order because I have the costume on and when I 'm ready to go you can do it the other way but this sometimes saves time and works well hello Beach police constable Rodriguez speaking see one report of missing penguin okay well we 're gonna do the best we can I can 't promise you anything at this stage and we 'll put all available police constables on the job what does a penguin look like we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man calm down young man we 'll put every available officer on the case don 't worry we 'll get him back what 's his name Percy okay we 're on the job so yes you can use lots of different props to help you make your film well if you like wigs help you look younger in my case yep flying carpets and you can play around with it you can find different objects you can put them on actually like flying different tricks well gee would you want to buy a flying carpet it 's only ten dollars guaranteed you don 't need a license or anything it 's only ten dollars oh okay thank you fellas let 's feel like another good day in the office hello mister yeah I lost my flying carpet how much does it work okay 15 Thanks thanks mister okay let 's fly so if you even if you film out a window and point it up at the sky you can make it and you just like you stand in front of it you can make it look like you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background but I 'm just showing you a few different techniques that you can use I 'm gonna use the green screen so it looks like the sky and I 've just put the carpet right over a chair and then I 'm going to sit on the carpet so it looks like a flying carpet this flying carpet is amazing it 's very fast pace you might come and they get you blessed I worry he 's still on my phone I 'll find you [Music] oh well I think pussy 's in that case and it looks really scary don 't worry Lizzie I 'm coming in I 've got your Percy like either flying Harper came and saved us hey Percy not that bad e right now let 's relax and enjoy the ride that flying carpet come from well he 'd be right overhead oh I 'll get you for this the only reason they defeated me is because I forgot my umbrella unbelievable a fun thing to do while you 're filming is to make fun commercials ads for television and that can be about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you getting someone to clean your room or even do you want to buy a flying carpet you do let me show you how it works you just hop on and away we go and only 9.99 it 's a bargain a fun part of filming can be the mistakes you make as you 're making your film these are usually called bloopers and you see them at the end of some big movies at the cinemas sometimes they just shows all the mistakes and there can be some funny mistakes because a lot of filming it takes time and so for an actor to remember all the lines and where they have to walk and things like that some mistakes happen and it makes for some funny material so that 's another thing you can play around I 'll give you a little example hey Jeff Oh Jeff you 're Percy I 'm Jeff so I forgot my we 've fun can 't can 't can 't well that 's about a wrap as we say that 's all the filming done I 've shown you a few different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editing and I 'll show you how we put it all together and a few little techniques that we can use to improve the film quality you can turn the sound up you can sort of play around with the images you can move the scenes around a little bit so I 'll show you all that in a next video thanks for watching bye"

    "text": "[Music] hi everybody and welcome to this video from the city of ride for how to make art from waste materials my name is Michelle and today we 're going to talk about weaving so there 's a link below to the worksheet let 's have a yarn as well as the educational resource if you 'd like some further information so let 's have a yarn is all about weaving and weaving is something that crosses all cultures and all countries it is an art form and a craft form so it 's something that can be made into something functional like a basket but it can also be made into beautiful artworks to hang on your wall as well so let 's get started so weaving is always done on a loom and a loom can be out of anything you would like so the first one is a commercial loom this is something that 's pre-made it already has segments cut into it and you wrap your yarn around from the top to the bottom and then go across with the weft so this is a frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled cleanup and I 've decided to turn this into a weaving loom but instead of taking my weaving off the loom I 'm going to keep it on it so what I 've done at the back I 've drilled some holes and I 've put some earrings at the top and now I 'm starting to thread my yarn through this and when I 'm finished my weaving it 's going to look like this and then it 's going to stay in its frame limits loom the other option is to make your own which is what I like to do so what you 'll need is a piece of cardboard a ruler and some scissors and a pencil so let 's get started measure with your ruler every one centimeter and make a mark make sure that it 's uniform make little dots and then we 're going to lengthen them so that we know where to cut so draw your lines all the way across in one centimeter segments so the next stage is to start cutting them so we want to turn it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them so when you 've cut all of your notches it should end up looking like this you need to be able to move your notches around so that the yarn will fit around and stay in place securely so now that you 've got your snips in your cardboard loom let 's dress it so that means making the warp threads go from the top to the bottom so the first thing is to secure your yarn so put it onto the back and take it down you want to keep quite a nice long tail so that once you 've finished your weaving you 'll be able to either sew this in or not it onto one of the other loops I 'm going to use some industrial waste this is just thin plastic twine so there 's lots of different options for what you can weave with you can weave with yarn with fabric with plastic packaging with ribbons paper cardboard the list is endless so now working from the bottom we 're going to put it through those notches that we just made so bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down through the bottom tab up again and keep going until it 's gone the whole way across your loom you want to have it quite tight but you don 't want to have the tabs buckling so make sure that they 're staying nice and flat but that all of your yarn is quite firm once you get to the end you 'll hopefully have a lovely long tail again are we going to stick that down again so now that our warp threads are done we 're going to do the West threads so a good way to remember which thread you 're doing the warp always goes up and down whereas the weft threads always go to the left and to the right there are lots of ways of putting your weft yarn into your loom you can use your fingers you can also use a bodkin and a bodkin is a special type of needle that has a really big eye and a blunt end you can also make your own so this is a little wooden skewer that I found in my kitchen and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might like to use a little wooden stick that you have maybe from an ice-cream treat or you can make your own as well so this one is just a piece of scrap cardboard and I 've cut some points on the and to help me to get my yarn through tape it on to the end and you 're ready to go and the basic weave is always over and under all the way across so this one I 'll start and go over under over under over under over under with my other hand I 'm going to start to pull it through and you 'll see the weaving take form so over and over and up over when you 're pulling it do it gently and slowly because you don 't want to break your loom and you don 't want all of your beautiful weaving to come undone so you might like to leave a tail again and stick it down if you 're new to weaving it gets it out of the way but once you get really good at it you don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to push our yarn up to the top of the Loom so you can either use your fingers like this or maybe you have a fork at home you can use a fork to bring it up or maybe a comb now my yarn my weft yarn is sitting nice and snug at the top so when it 's sitting nice and straight you 're ready to go back the other way and this was really important so because the yarn is currently under now I need to go over so over that one under that one over that one under that one all the way to the end so at this stage you want to check that that warp yarn is still staying nice and upright if I pull too hard it will start to distort my loom and that 's shown me that I need to release some of that pressure make it nice and straight again and use my comb and my fork on my fingers to bring that yarn up slowly so once you get lots of practice in doing a plain weave which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimenting with different patterns you can also start to introduce new colors so this one is a twill weave and it goes over two and two to over to pull it through gently and keep a nice long tail I 'd like to show you some different options for weaving now you might like to use a thin piece of cardboard so then you 're going to have a really long thin bit of weaving this is one that has been made from fabric these are fabric scraps from an interior designer and they 've got a beautiful range of colors in those shades and I 've used some pinking shears which will give that beautiful zigzag cut onto my fabric so this is an old Christmas ribbon that I 've reused for my warp yarn another idea is to use paper so I found an old magazine and this was an image that I thought was really beautiful so I focused on the bottom of the floor where there was a rug and I ripped it using a ruler so just carefully push your ruler down with one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards you so you might need quite a few of those strips and then it 's the same process and with this one I 've used some Baker 's twine so the other one is to weave with different materials so with this one my warp yarn is blending in to my weft yarn you can 't see it so much we 're really celebrating those wonderful diverse textured ribbons so at the bottom I 've got a bit of a pattern we 've sewn a thin metallic ribbon some lovely texture or thick wide ribbon and then some shiny ribbon you can definitely vary it up and make it look really individual and beautiful in here is just a collection of different things you could use some braids some old gift wrapping ribbons some lovely diverse collections that I 've found from second-hand shops and charity shops the other thing that I 'd like to show you is how to weave in a circle so these are some looms that I 'm going to make out of paper plates and I 've checked and measured and if I cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate so we 're going to make the warp yarns but instead of going up and down these ones are going to go opposite so we 'll start exactly the same way have a tail at the back stick it down turn it to the front and go through down and accross around through and opposite around and all the way to the end so you 're crossing over every time you do it I 'm going to pull my last bit through and onto the back take my tail down so now it 's just a matter of weaving around in a circle this time I 'm going to use this knobbly yarn which is quite fun to weave with so I 'm going to use my fingers to do this one same process under over under you 'll end up with an end and you can tuck it in push it into the center and then from the other end start to close up your circle so once you 've made a circle you can either stop there and tuck a tail in underneath and now you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to show you how to finish off your weaving if you 'd like to take it off your loom so if you have woven on something like a cardboard loom it 's not probably going to be what you would like to hang on your wall so there are a few different options so you can bend the tab and carefully take your loops off so work the whole way around and there are a few different options now you could put something through it so this is an old eating needle you might like to just weave them through a knitting needle and you can hang it off like that you can also tie knots into them at the end very carefully so that your weaving doesn 't come off so now you know how to weave in a straight line you also know how to read in circle so now it 's up to you as to what you 'd like to do with your weaving skills you can incorporate different ways of patterns and colors you can make it as individual as you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaving that you do please send us some photos and remember to submit your entry to the Swap ArtPrize [Music]"

    "text": "[Music] hello everybody my name is Michelle and I 'd like to welcome you to this video from the city of ride today we 're going to be making some art from West this year we 're celebrating 10 years of the Swap Art Awards in ride so that 's a sustainable waste to art prize and I 'd love you to join in and make an artwork too so today I 'm going to talk you through plastic fantastic there will be a link to the educational resource and also some worksheets to give you more details on how to make your artwork plastic fantastic is all about making collage so using the rubbish and the waste that we would normally put into the red cycle or into our bins and turning it into art you 're going to need something to make your art on so this is a piece of cardboard that I cut out of a box that I had some things delivered to me in we 're going to make a scene so today I think I 'd like to make the ocean that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the country maybe it 's the wildlife maybe it 's creatures that live in the air our Australian wildlife or even in the ocean so think about some landscapes that you would like to explore to make with your plastic collage so I 've decided to do the ocean so I 'm going to create a blue backdrop to begin with so depending on what your scene is you 'll want to choose different colors of packaging to cut out different colors and down at the bottom I 've got a blue plastic bag you might also like to use some old wrapping paper that you have at home maybe you like the colored side or maybe you like a silver side so using my bag I 'm going to get some scissors you 'll want to have a collection of different scissors for this some of the rounder scissors are good also some really sharp pointy ones these smaller tipped ones are good for getting into corners and these ones are really good for nice strong smooth cuts moving on to the glues and the tapes try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glue dots and a glue stick is a good place to start you might need to move on to maybe some masking tape or some double-sided tape sticky tape is really good for attaching things onto the back of your board or even some packing tape if you 've got a really big surface area that you 're trying to work with if you need to use glue you can use a school glue maybe a clear craft glue this is a super super sticky strong glue and this is a PVA wood glue it 's going to use my sharp ones to begin with it 's gonna cut down the seam of that plastic bag and I 'm going to wrap my cardboard in it I 'm going to lay it down and wrap it up like a present so I 'm going to use just some sticky tape for this part so tape it down so it 's sitting nice and flat at the front you 'll want to take some time carefully folding it so that the edges look nice and neat so I 've got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candice this is an old canvas that I had at home that I wasn 't using anymore and I didn 't want it to go to waste so I 've reused it and turned it into a backdrop and as you can see I 've got my blue plastic bag but I 've also started to cut out and stick on or collage lots of different colors of blue different shades of blue to give me depth to my ocean so down the bottom it feels like I 'm deep down in the ocean and up at the top it feels like I 'm slowly moving up so I 've looked through my plastic packaging and I 've found different colors so I 've got some green some light blue some purple and some dark blue and I chopped them all out with my different scissors and I made them in little wavy lines and I cut a lot of them you might like to think about the background but also the foreground and lots of details I 've also used this builders tape and this builders tape has helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plastic onto the frame so it meetin 's it up and makes it look really beautiful when it 's going to be hanging on my wall I also think about the edges of your artwork so if you 've made a pattern on the front think about continuing on to the side too so if you 're walking past your artwork you still get to see the beautiful designs on the side too so using some cardboard scraps I 've drawn some fish onto some cardboard and then I 've put some plastic packaging down with the orange and then I 've put glue all over my fish shape for my next fish I did exactly the same but I 've also added a piece of foam so at your home you might have some foam from fruit and veggie sharp maybe the butcher 's which you can wash and reuse and this way it 's going to meet my fish stand up and be more three-dimensional so he looks like it 's swimming through the ocean I 've used a purple plastic packaging wrapper and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've also used some different colored Barker 's to put some details on my fish finally for my last little fish it 's just little scraps of plastic packaging and then I 've used some colored markers to put in some extra details for the lines with the fins with my coral I 've made thin bits and fat bits again just out of a scrap of cardboard from my kitchen it 's up to you what you 'd like to use you might like to have the writing come through to add a different layer as well so now we need to have a look at how our artwork can be put together maybe this looks better at the side [Music] maybe this fish might even come in underneath the coral and go over the top this one you might like to have it hanging off the edge of your artwork and this one might be pointing up to the sky now have a look through your house and see what else you can add I found an old happy birthday sign so I 'm going to type that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are some plastic wrapping that have come off some florists flowers make sure that you cover your edges fold them and make them look neat and beautiful and try using different types of glue until they all stick down together so that 's going to be my artwork I wonder what you will do we 'd love to see your photos so please make an artwork out of some plastic packaging at home make a beautiful College and share it with us on the link below and don 't forget to enter the Swap ArtPrize can 't wait to see you there"

    "text": "hi everybody my name is Michelle and welcome to this video from the city of ride today we 're going to make art from waste so that you can join in and make some artworks for the sustainable waste to our prize swap which is celebrating 10 years this year today we 're going to be making waste warriors and if you 'd like to look below there 'll be a link for the educational resource and also the worksheet to help you along waist warriors is all about assemblage and assemblages a 3d construction of all different types of objects coming together so depending on what your idea is you 'll need to start by making an armature an armature is a structure or a skeleton that 's going to give your waste warrior some shape so if you would like to make something small you might like to start with maybe some straws if you want something with a little bit more structure and that can move you might like to use some pipe cleaners you can work up to a wire and then you can have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all we need to get our workspace ready and get your materials so you have a space where you can cut and twist you might need some goggles or some gloves and maybe some clamps as well you 'll also need maybe some wire cutters if you 're planning to make something a big if you 're using a knife make sure that you 've got a metal ruler you might need to have some help from an adult or even a friend so that you can both twist the wire okay so I 'm going to show you how to make an assemblage just using recycled items that you would have at home in your waist or your recycling bin so I 've found an egg carton I 've got different types of tubes and I 've also got these fabulous little cone shapes that I thought I 'd use I 've got some scrunched newspaper ready so that I can fill up my different sections and also some paper plates so I 'm thinking that my waist warrior might be kind of a crocodile inspired creature I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes I thought they might make great legs also going to use my cones so that it can have a head but also maybe some thorns on its back as well so in order for all of my cardboard to stay together I need to stuff it with some newspaper to fill up all these holes and also use some masking tape to attach it all together so I 've got some newspaper that I 've scrunched up already anything that 's soft fits around the home is perfect you 've got some junk mail or some old wrapping put whatever you can in there 's all different sizes of masking tape so in terms of sustainability try to use the least amount as possible so that you 've got extra resources to share with somebody else so I 'm going to fill these tubes with some scrunched up newspaper it 'll give it some extra structure and it will help attach it to the egg cartons and this one 's a little bit shorter so I 'm going to have to use a little bit more newspaper to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I can start to take them on so I 'm going to use my small tape to shoot a big one all over the top we 're just checking seeing how it looks [Music] so things won 't be perfect at this stage but you 're wanting to just make sure that the shape is something that you 're happy with we 're going to add some more scrunched paper to give it more shape and definition and we 'll be wrapping it up in fabric later so as long as the basic skeleton is looking good then let 's keep going so now I 've got my waist warrior put together I thought it was going to be an alligator or a crocodile but actually now I look at it it 's totally changed and that 's fine as soon as you start putting things together your materials will talk to you and they 'll tell you what they would like to be transformed into so if you have an idea and it changes that 's perfectly fine so here he is he 's got his nose he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some scrunched up newspaper to give it more of a shape to its body and also so that you can 't see that it 's an egg carton in underneath so now I 've got some strips of fabric and this fabric is perfect because it has some stretch in it so it 's going to enable me to wrap up my waist worried you 're nice and tight so it doesn 't really matter where you start but you 're wanting to essentially wrap all that paper together so that it won 't come off so pulling it nice and tight tucking it in when you get to the end so again this is not about making your waist warrior look beautiful it 's just about keeping it all together and keep going until it 's totally wrapped up so now I 've got my waist warrior totally wrapped up with fabric and that 's going to give me the perfect space to glue things to stitch things to and attach things to so here are some fruit wrappers but I 've collected off my fruit and vegetables in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can even hang down as well this is some industrial letterbox numbers that are all excess they could be made in two different passions they 'd be good to sow through the holes I 've got some buttons they might like to be eyes these ones are broken earrings so have a look through your home and see what you 've got I have some excess industrial lids there 's islands up quite beautiful over here as little strips of plastic with circles in it so they could be very effective for making patterns I also have a collection of lids with these you might like to use a metal skewer or a drill if you have one to put holes in them and that will help you attach them to your waste warrior there 's also some excess florists ribbon this is really great you can tear it into little strips have a look for something like a raffia you can again use this to bind over your entire creature so that it gives it more of a natural feel and also don 't forget about just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also sometimes might need to use our spray glue and that will cover a large surface area and it will also hold nice and strong another thing if you 'd like to choose a non-toxic option is to bind things or to wrap them so these are just some beautiful colors of twine and embroidery thread and that might become part of the detail so let your heart go wild and find ways to make your waist warrior come to life once you 've done it please submit to your entry to the Swap Art Award and also follow the links below with the hash tags and show us what you 've made with your swaps art project thank you [Music]"

    "text": "[Music] hi welcome back to the little bang Discovery Club I 'm Wendy from children 's discovery in Sydney and this is session four which is all about a science fair we 'll get to that in a moment just a reminder that the children other junior discovers doing the thinking and the grown-ups are their lab assistants helping them and once again probably be a good idea to pause the recording after I show you how to set up the experiment and then to go and try it so what is a science fair scientists usually let other scientists know about their discoveries at a science fair where they all get together and talk about what they 've just discovered or they might publish their work in a journal now if this was a face-to-face little bangs like normal you would have all tried an experiment through the week and then you would tell us about it today but this is not a normal little bangs so we can 't actually have our science fair the way scientists do but perhaps you 've got friends that you might phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've done a bit like a science fair now we 're going to have a look at what happened in the experiments I showed you last time so here I 've got my little magnet on the back of my fish and if I 'm going to test what it will stick to and what it won 't stick to so I 've got some things made of different things here I 've got a ruler made of wood and I 'm going to make a prediction that it won 't stick so if I try and put it on no it doesn 't stick so I got an expected result I 've got a chopstick made of plastic and I 'm going to predict that it won 't stick try putting it on no it doesn 't stick I got an expected result now I 've got a spoon made of metal and I think that magnets stick to metal so I 'm going to predict that this time it will stick and if I put it on yes it does stick so I got an expected result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's see I 'm going to predict that it will stick no it doesn 't stick so magnets don 't stick to every metal this is an aluminium can and magnets don 't stick to that but my spoon that it did stick to has got iron in it and that 's one of the metals that magnets stick to so if you had your magnet sticking to things around your place it 's probably because they 've got iron in them so that 's our our magnet experiment now our musical coat hanger experiment I hope the grown-ups tried this one as well Adam could you please help me with this we 're going to get Adam back to hang the coat hanger from his fingers I hope so right so when we tap the coat hanger just a light sound to us but when Adam puts it in his ears he gets a how 'd you how would you describe it at him like it being underneath a giant Bell okay so a huge big sound so what 's making the difference what 's been different to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I hear sound to this how the sound is getting to Adams ears you know my fingers feel something in my fingers when you hit the coat hanger can you wiggling your fingers a wiggling does any do you know what the the special word is for that when we hit something and it starts to wiggle or move backwards and forwards do you know what that word is that 'd be a vibration if that would be a vibration so when we strike the coat hanger it starts to vibrate or move backwards and forwards now how does the sound get to my ears when I 'm not holding the strings or to Adams when his fingers aren 't in his ears what happens is the coat hanger vibrates and hits the air next to it because the room is full of air even though we can 't see it hits the air next to it which vibrates hits the air next to it which vibrates hits the air next to actual vibrates and finally gets into my ear to my eardrum which vibrates but you can imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the vibration is spreading out so the bit that gets to my ear is quite small but when Adams got his fingers in his ears and we make the the coathanger vibrate it makes the string vibrate which makes his fingers vibrate so that the sound is actually getting to his ears along something much more solid than air and therefore it 's a much louder sound much more resonant Thank You Adam now with our salt water and our tap water I 'm thinking that you might have got an unexpected result here so just make sure our salt water is salty enough when I put the egg in the tap water it sinks but when I put the egg in the salty water it floats now let 's try that with the grape grape in the tap water sinks now if you didn 't do a grape what do you think it 's going to do in the salty water I have to tell your grown-up what do you think the grape is going to do when we put it in the salty water it floats now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on so this one has just got water in it this one 's got quite a bit of salt in it so the salty water is much more buoyant than the tap water so that 's why the egg would sink in this one and float in this one now this is an experiment that you can try for yourself if you ever go swimming at a swimming pool that 's got chlorinated water you 're going to be swimming in water like this and it 's more difficult to float then if you go down to a rock pool where the water is salty and it 's it 's more buoyant so it pushes you up more and it 's easier to float in salty water and there are some places on earth where the water is so salty that you can 't help but float so the example of course is the Dead Sea that 's between Israel and Jordan now there 's an old test for how fresh eggs are mostly these days we buy our eggs from a supermarket and it has a use by date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own chucks they used to get their eggs and if they put it in the fresh water and it sank they knew the egg was good but if they put it in the in the tap water and it floated like it just did in the salt water they knew the egg was not good because when eggs start to go bad they make a gas inside them and that makes them more buoyant so if you ever put an egg into tap water and it floats you don 't want to open it because it 's going to be very smelly it 's going to smell really bad all right now let 's try our last experiment which was sink and float without pieces of blue tack so we 've got our three cups with water and we 've got our three blue tack shapes so our first spiral or round shape what did you expect it to do sink or float and then when you put it in its sink our next shape the flat shape what did you expect it to do sink or float and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got stuck on my cup there but if it 's if I let it it 'll go all the way to the bottom what about our boats or our cup shape what do you think it 's going to do sink or float now if we put it in very carefully without getting any water in it we can get it to float so the same strip of blue tack you might remember the same amount of blu-tac but made into different shapes will determine whether it sinks or floats so the shape was what was important and that is why boats that are that sort of a shape but are made from very heavy materials like iron and steel will actually float even though they 're so heavy if they were a different shape they wouldn 't float but then if you get water in your boat then it will float when it 's filled up with water and no longer filled up with air it will sink okay so now I 'm going to show you some new experiments to try this week now we 're ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've got a puzzle that we 're going to have a look at up close in a moment where we count how many blue and how many red pencils there are and then we swap the places of the bottom pieces of the puzzle and count again so here we have our disappearing pencil puzzle let 's count how many red puffs red pencils we 've got at the moment one two three four five six seven red pencils and blue ones we 've got one two three four five six so can you remember that seven red pencils and six blue ones now I 'm going to swap the puzzle pieces over now let 's count again red ones first we had seven last time one two three four five six one of our red pencils seems to have disappeared and we had six blue ones last time one two three four five six seven so one of our pencils has changed color from red to blue now can you work out what 's going on have a talk with your grown-up and see if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next experiment is about magnifying and for this one you need a glass with water in it and a picture from a newspaper or a magazine and what you 're going to do is hold the glass with water in front of your picture and see what happens to the picture now depending on where your glass is the picture might get bigger and it might even reverse see if you can get it to do that and then do the same thing with your finger so your finger tip put that near the magnet near the water that 's going to magnify it and see if you can make your fingertips so big that you can see the little lines that are on there and that 's called your fingerprint and then have a look at your grown-ups fingerprint you should find that it 's different to yours everyone has a different fingerprint and can you also get your finger to reverse to be looks like it 's coming from this way when it 's really this way see what you can do by magnifying with a glass with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloons so for this one you 'll need a couple of balloons blown up to the same size and two pieces of string about 30 centimeters long and you 're going to tie the string around the top of the blown up balloon so a bit like our musical coat hanger you can hang the balloons by their strings so when you 've tied them on you 're going to put them in front of your face about five centimeters apart and then you 're going to try and blow them apart so while they 're in front of your face you 're going to blow hard to blow them apart now I 'm not actually going to do it just at the moment because I want you to try it first and see what happens sounds pretty easy doesn 't it blowing balloons apart see if you can manage to do it now our last experiment is called raw or boiled and this is where you need your raw your raw egg and your boiled egg now hopefully your grown-up knows that you 've got a raw egg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one is which so on one of the eggs put the number one and one of the eggs put the number two and you 're going to try and guess which one is raw and which one is boiled but without breaking the shells so it would be easy to crack them open and see but we 're not going to do that so you might look at them yeah they look pretty similar you might give them a shake and have a listen can you hear a difference you might smell will the spoiled one smell more eggy perhaps you might try putting them in some water like we did last week except this time it 's just tap water we haven 't got any salt in it will it make a difference if it 's raw or if it 's boiled whether it floats or not now what did it do last week in the fresh water you might remember that the egg sank and that was a boiled egg so you 'd expect the boiled egg to sink again this time but will the fresh egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to tell apart from cracking the shells see if you can work out which one is your raw and which one is your boiled egg so did you find out a reason that the pencils changed color if you have a look there are two pencils here that can be either color one of them is the lead that 's just the lid and one of them there is just the eraser now at the moment those two pencils are colored blue but when we swap them over what color do you think they 're going to be now have a guess with your grown-up so here 's our lead only pencil and it 's red and here 's our a razor only pencil and it 's also red so this is a clever picture that it 's not an optical illusion it 's a clever picture that allows it to appear that the colors are the cut the pencils are changing color how did you go with your glass of water and your picture did you get it to get much bigger did you even get it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was facing the other way now what 's going on here when light goes through water it bends so the water in the glass is like a convex lens which magnifies things makes them bigger and the bending of the light can make the image face the other way did you notice when you when your image was really large that it was made up of dots so this is actually made up of very very small dots so small that my eyes can 't see them individually and they blend together to make an image but you might have seen a picture on your computer perhaps where you could actually see not the dots on your computer there little squares called pixels and it was a blurry image made up of little squares because they were too big and your eyes could actually tell them apart now what about your finger could you see your fingerprint and could you see your grown-ups fingerprint was different to yours and did your finger look like it it was popped around the other way depending upon how far away the glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it bends and that was what made the magnification and the reversing happen now our balloons did you manage to blow them apart let 's see if I can holding them in front of my face about 7 metres apart and I blow between them they come together try it again I can 't blow them apart if you 're blowing right in the middle they always come together and that 's why this experiment is called kissing balloons and not blown madly apart balloons so what 's happening if you blow onto your hand can you feel that the air you blow out is going fast so that air that faster air when it goes between the balloons makes the pressure between the balloons drop so when air is going faster the pressure is less and is now less than the pressure on the outside of the balloons and so it is actually that pressure on the outside of the balloons that pushes them together so that 's a pretty hard thing to understand but doesn 't mean you can 't have fun experimenting with it okay and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell by looking which one 's raw or boiled while the eggs aren 't cracked I can 't tell by smelling now children usually have a better sense of smell than their grownups so maybe they could tell a difference I can tell a little bit by shaking especially if you 've been shaking for a long time because the raw egg is getting a bit mushed up inside there from all the shaking and starts to wobble around so I can actually hear a bit more of a wobble coming from my number 2 so maybe that 's the wrong one what about putting it in the water sinks to the bottom I think this might be my boiled one what about the the raw one does will it float because it has been cooked no it sinks to the bottom as well now there is a way to tell that 's really easy that I haven 't shown you yet it might be something that you already knew if you didn 't already know it I doubt you would have guessed what to do so I 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try and spin them so if I spin this one well it spins really well if I try and spin this one it hardly spins at all so which one then do you think would be the boiled egg and which one would be the raw egg do you think the one that 's solid on the inside would spin well and the one that 's full of thick liquid on the inside wouldn 't you 'd be right so my boiled egg is number one and my raw egg is number two so what I could hear slightly was in actual fact my raw egg slightly swishing around inside there so this this egg that 's boiled is solid all the way through and when you spin it on the outside it will spin really well the raw egg which is still mushy in the middle doesn 't like to spin now why didn 't why didn 't we get a difference with our cup why didn 't the raw egg float it 's because even though this one 's raw and this one 's boiled and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's solid they still have the same amount of egg inside them because we haven 't taken any out so that means they 're both going to sink in the tap water as long as they 're not going off like I explained last week so well done all our families you 've now finished the little being Discovery Club on-demand version well done to our junior discoverers and also to our lab assistants I hope you manage to hold back and let the children do the thinking and now you all know how science works so science is just a systematic way of answering your question think of a question make up a guess what you think 's happening come up with a test test it see what the results are and then you can come to a conclusion based on the evidence so it doesn 't have to be in a laboratory it can be in your home you can be doing science all the time and you probably are doing science all the time posing questions how long is it going to take me to get somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there early next time I don 't have to be quite leave quite so early so you 're really doing science all the time it 's nothing special in laboratories that only really learned people can do everyone can do science and I 'm hoping that next time your children ask you why you 're going to say to them let 's find out together let 's try and find a way to answer that ourselves so that 's something that families can have a lot of fun doing together you can have lot fun doing science together making up experiments testing things and trying to find your own evidence-based conclusions well done everybody and I want the children all to grow up and be scientists [Music]"

    "text": "[Music] hi I 'm Wendy from children 's discovery in Sydney and this is the little bang Discovery Club today we 're going to learn all about how experiments work now just to remind you the children should be doing this session with a grown-up they are the junior Discoverer is doing all the thinking and the adults are their lab assistants who are helping them so let your child do some thinking and talk to your child about what they 're thinking it also might be best especially today when I show you how to set up an experiment to then pause the recording and try and do the experiment and then come back to the recording now last week we learnt about measuring and recording and you might remember we made our coat hanger balance so hopefully you made your coat hanger balance and used it a lot and then I showed you how to make a mobile so I 'm hoping that you managed to make a mobile and I 'm also hoping that you did lots of measuring and wrote down what you measured now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new you discovered either using the coat hanger balance use it making your mobile or doing some measuring so talk to your grown-up now about something new that you discovered now today we 're learning about what an experiment is we 've already done a bit of experimenting like when we were using our coat hanger balance we were doing experiments so usually the way scientists do an experiment is first of all they 've got a question they want to know something which thing was heavier was our question before the coat hanger balance experiment then they make a guess or a prediction which one they think is going to be heavier then they do a test so you put the things into the coat hanger balance you observe what happens and then scientists will write down what happened and then they come to a conclusion about their experiments so it 's an evidence-based conclusion they might have guessed one thing would be heavier but the actual evidence showed the other thing was the heavier thing so they make conclusions based on evidence now we 're going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in a moment I 'd like you to try and do the same thing now I 've got a box that I 'm resting a mini whiteboard on but you don 't have to use a mini whiteboard you might use a piece of cardboard or you might use a tray or you might use the lid of the box to make your slide so we 're trying to make a slide and you might not use a box to rest it on you might use a low chair you might use a pile of cushions doesn 't matter as long as you 've got a slide now I 'm sure you all know how slides work you sit at the top you let go and you slide down thanks to gravity well we 're going to be doing some testing of which thing is the quickest down the slide so from your discovery box I 'd like you to choose some things first of all can you please find for me your ruler and your pencil so ruler and a pencil if you haven 't got a ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see which one slides the fastest now you can touch them and feel which one do you think is the slipperiest that will go the quickest down the slide so have a have a guess with your grown-up till your grown-up which one you think is going to be the quickest and then let 's watch what I do so here we are we 've got our two things on the slide I 'm going to say ready set go and then we 'll see which one is the quickest ready set go now the ruler got there first but was that fair for the pencil what did I do to make it unfair for the pencil talk to your grown-up what 's wrong with my test now I 'm hoping that you all said I didn 't let them go at the same time if it 's going to be a fair slide you 've got to let go at the same time okay so this time I 'm going to try and let go at the same time and we 'll see which one is the quickest down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess because you 've already seen this experiment even though it wasn 't fair and if you want to change your mind you 're allowed to okay here we go I 'm trying to let go at the same time ready set go okay now the ruler still got there first but was it a fair test talk to your grown-up there 's still something wrong with this test what 's wrong with starting them like this have it talk to your grown-up now I 'm hoping that you realized that the ruler starts from down here and only has to go this far whereas the pencil starts from up here and has to go this far so that 's not very fair talk to your grown-up about how we can change something so that they both slide the same amount now sometimes children have suggested to me that we should cut the ruler off about there to make it fair and sometimes children have suggested to me that we should stick two pencils together to make it fit so that both items end up being the same length now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might have thought of too is let 's make the starting line the same so now both objects I 'd have to have to slide down the same distance all right have a guess which one 's going to be the quickest you 're allowed to change your mind ready set go oh gosh it 's hard to tell isn 't it we 'll try that once more and with the magic of recording we might even be able to get it in slow motion so we can see which one is the quickest let 's try that again ready set go I think the pencil just got there now you 're going to test some things down your slide you can test your ruler and your pencil and then you can choose some more things from your discovery box like your chopstick say say the pencil was the fastest maybe keep it and test it against the chopstick or your big spoon then if the pencil still the fastest perhaps you 'll test it against the coat hanger and then you might like to test it against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one have a guess and then test and but test it fairly and see which one is the best slider okay so how did you go did you get expected or unexpected results and what was the fastest thing down the slide for you I 'd like to show you how my experiment went with the pencil and the magnet so there 's a magnet on the back of this little fish so when I put them on making sure that they start out at the same spot or maybe I should put the fish pointing down so it can swim down quickest here we go ready set go oh no my fish didn 't slide at all now there 's a reason for that this is a magnetic whiteboard so the fish didn 't have a hope of sliding was that a fair test for the magnets no what do I need to do instead to make it fair for the magnet talk to your grown-up how could we make it fair for this magnet to slide down our slide now I 'm hoping that you thought use something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardboard for example let 's put our things on the cardboard actually I 'll use the tray it 's a bit longer okay which one do you think will be the fastest this time ready set go Oh hard to tell but at least that time the magnet could slide now you can do more sliding experiments or you might like to try something a little bit different instead of sliding things you might like to try some small wheeled toys and try them rolling down the slide so this time I 've got a sporty looking car made of metal so it 's heavier and I 've got a red plastic locomotive now which one do you think will be the fastest down the slide the sporty car or the locomotive have a guess with your grown-up okay here we go ready set go oh well the car went a very long way in the distance so if we were if we were not just racing down here but who can go the furthest it would definitely be the car so there 's a different type of experiment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which toy can roll the furthest so now 's the time to do some more sliding with things from your discovery box or from your house or with your toys but remember make it fair and guess first which one you think will be the quickest when we get back after that I 'm going to be showing you how to do some more experiments okay now that you know how to do a fair test or an experiment like they do in science I 'm going to show you four experiments that you can do at home it would probably be a good idea to see how I set them up and then press pause and go and try them and when you do them you need to predict what 's going to happen and see if you get any expected or unexpected results now our first experiment is using our magnet so I 've got my little fishy magnet from before and you 're I 'm going to test what it will stick to and what it doesn 't stick to so in the space you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can make a list of what it sticks to and what it doesn 't stick to and before you try it on something have a guess do I think it 's going to stick or not so here at the it 's a plastic table that I 'm working on I don 't think it 's going to stick no it 's not sticking but if I have a look underneath and there 's some metal there do I think it will stick there oh yes it 's trying to stick yep yep it 's sticking so try your magnet on all different materials and make a prediction will it stick or not and then afterwards write down whether it did stick or what it what it does stick and what it doesn 't stick to the next one is called musical coat hanger and for this you need a metal coat hanger and two pieces of string about 45 centimetres long now in one end of one piece of string you 're going to tie a loop that you can put your finger into so my finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the coat hanger and then you do the same thing with this piece of string tie a loop and tied on to the coat hanger now I 'm going to ask my colleague Adam to help me with this one because I 've got the coat hanger being dangled by the strings and the coat hanger is going to be a percussion instrument so we 're going to strike it or hit it and Adam what what would you like to hit it with the stick the spoon or the pencil maybe they will make a difference maybe well okay let 's try one thing we 'll try another line yep little bit musical try the spoon Oh even more musical now this time though instead of just holding the coat hanger here I 'm going to put my fingers in my ears and Adams going to hit the coat hanger again wow that was amazing amazing to me can I have a go yeah what would you like me to use the pencil the stick all this spoons do the pencil pencil pencil I 've got the pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music or coat hanger and let everyone in your family try it because it is amazing now the next experiment we 're going to try is called sink and salt so here we have two cups with tap water in them now I 'm using transparent cups so that you can see but they don 't have to be they can be colored cups they can be ceramic cups just something that will hold the water now I 've also got a quarter of a cup of salt and in my bowl I 've got a hard-boiled egg and a grape so what we 're going to do is pour the salt into one of the cups and give it a stir so now you can see that we 've got plain tap water and salty water now the experiment that you 're going to do is to carefully float the egg on top of the water and see what it does but before you do you need to make a prediction have a guess do you think it 's going to sink or do you think it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grape try that I 'm not going to actually do it because I want you to try it now grown-ups it might be an idea for you to hold the cup so it doesn 't get bumped while the children are carefully putting the egg in to the water and then you might like to use a spoon to help get the egg out and once again grown-ups if you hold the cup so before you try the experiment though make sure that you have a guess what 's going to happen so it 's just cups of water and a quarter of a cup of salt poured into one and give it a little stir okay try that one now our fourth experiment for today is called sink and float and this time you 've got three cups with water in them and this is where you need your blue tack or your plasticine so using the same amount of blue tack you 're going to make three different shapes so the first shape is going to be a round or a spiral shape so if you roll your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape the next shape is going to be a flat shape so perhaps fold your blue tack into about three and mush it together to make a flat shape and your third shape is going to be a boat or a cup shape so you probably want to start off with a flat shape like that squash it together and then make it into a cup or a boat shape and like before with the egg that you 're putting into the tap or the salt water you want to carefully put these shapes onto the top of the water to see if you can get them to float so once again grown-ups perhaps you hold the cup so that the children can carefully with two hands put their shape onto the water and see if it will float but before they do what do you need to do make a prediction or have a guess do you think the round shape is going to sink or float do you think the flat shape is going to sink or float do you think the bowl or boat shape is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to go away and have a go at that one as well what I 'd like you to think about is what is going on in these experiments why is this happening next week we will start our last session explaining the science behind what happened in these experiments but it 's really good if you can have a think about it in the meantime try and think about what is happening why did this happen so that 's what we 'll start with next session explaining what went on now next session as well as a boiled egg you 'll need a raw egg so grown-ups you need to prepare a boiled egg and have a raw egg but don 't tell the children which one is which and don 't put you know don 't write boiled on it so that they know we want them to not know which egg is which so boiled it and a raw egg for next time all right so you 've got lots of things to go and try and try and do some thinking about what is going on [Music]"

    "text": "[Music] welcome back to the little bang Discovery Club I 'm Wendy from Children 's Discovery in Sydney and just a reminder that the children are our junior discoverers doing all the thinking and they 're grown-ups are there to help them as they 're lab assistants if they need help with something then please help them but let the kids do the thinking now you might once again like to see what I do set up an activity pause the recording and then go and try it for yourselves today 's session is all about measuring and recording which is something else that scientists do a lot of now we finished last week with a collection and I suggested you make a collection of your own and I showed you some leaves now I 've got a few more collections to show you which are inspired by what children have brought me along in past programs so a popular thing for children to show is a collection of shells so there are few different shells in there another thing that children like to collect are sticks and they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers and while they 're in the garden they often find some stones they also might find some feathers and these are getting a bit old fashioned now but they still exist postcards people send you from when they 're around holiday so there 's some ideas about some of the collections you might have had now children I 'd like you to talk to your grown-up and show them the favorite thing from what you 've collected and the biggest thing that you collected and the smallest thing that you collected so have a little chat with your grown-up about the collection that you 've made hopefully you 've all managed to find some items to put in discovery box so I hope you had fun doing your treasure hunt last week and you found some items to put in your discovery box so what I 'd like you to do now is to choose five items from your discovery box put them out on the space in front of you and arrange them the longest at one end down to the shortest at the other end so choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's quite okay so adults let the children do the choosing and choose five things lined up longest down to shortest now I 'd like you to point to your longest thing so for me the longest thing was my ruler but you might have chosen something quite different now I 'd like you to point to your shortest thing and for me my shortest thing was my fridge magnet and now I 'd like you to point to your middle thing now there 's a special word for the middle thing and that 's called the median so if you ever hear anyone talking about the median they 're talking about the middle thing now that was quite an easy thing for us to do we didn 't actually have to do any measuring because we could easily compare just by looking at which was the longest down which is the shortest so we didn 't actually do any measuring there but we did do some comparing now leave those things there because we 're going to use them again soon but now I 'd like you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you haven 't got a chopstick your big spoon so see if you can find those things and then I 'm going to show you what to do with them now with your chopstick or big spoon we 're not going to use them to eat with we 're going to use them to measure with and we 're going to measure your height now this is one way of doing it so count with me 1 2 3 4 5 6 so not quite 6 chopsticks tall so after you 've measured how tall you are in chopsticks or spoons get your notebook and grown-up 's you might need to help with this so I 'm nearly 6 chopsticks tool so now might be a good time to pause the recording and to measure your height in chopsticks and then write it down now so I just like to do things over and over again to check that they did it right the first time so I 'm going to check my heart in chopsticks once more here we go count with me 1 2 3 4 5 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chopsticks a few minutes ago what 's going on here have I suddenly grown or did I do it so badly the first time this time I 'm nearly 8 chopsticks you 're right I 'm tricking you the first time I used this chopstick and that gave me a height of 6 the second time I used this much shorter chopstick and that 's why you don 't normally measure your height in chopsticks this is an informal measure and not all chopsticks are the same length so what I 'd like you to do now is to have a look in your discovery box and see if you can find something that might be better for measuring your height width than chopsticks that it doesn 't matter whose measuring it 'll be the same unit of measurement so have a look in your in your discovery box see what you can find and then I 'd like the grownups to measure their children in centimeters so see see what you can find in your discovery box that might help you measure in centimeters then measure their height and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you use to measure your height with did you use perhaps your ruler using the chopstick method and then added up all those centimeters or did you use your tape measure that might have looked like this to get how tall you were that was probably the easiest way to measure your height and were you surprised at how tall you are now talk to your grown-up about how much you 've grown recently now it was it was easy for us to look at things and compare how long they are or to measure things and see how long they are but it 's not so easy to tell how heavy things are just by looking so if you pick up your longest thing from your discovery box from before and your shortest thing from your discovery box and you put them in in your hands can you really tell which one 's the heaviest just by filling them and looking at them let 's try and make a way of telling which one 's heaviest that 's a bit more accurate so what we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you need for this are two plastic cups two big rubber bands two pieces of string that are about thirty centimeters long and your coat hanger so either coat hanger like this or a coat hanger like that either one you can use so if you don 't have any of those things with you right at the moment perhaps pause the recording and get them and then I 'll show you how to make your balance so the first step to making your balance is to put your rubber bands onto the plastic cups so that the rubber bands are up near the top now using your pieces of string you 're going to tie a knot underneath your rubber band on one side for both of your plastic cups now the next step depends upon which type of coat hanger you 've got so if you 've got a coat hanger like this with little hooks you do it slightly differently too if you 've got a coat hanger like this that doesn 't have any little hooks so let me show you what to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your coat hanger you can put your piece of string across the other side of the cup tie a little knot and then move the string so that it 's evenly spaced like this and then you can put it on to the little hook so if you 've got this type of coat hanger you then do the other cup the same way if you don 't have little hooks on your coat hanger then what you need to do is put this piece of string over over the bottom of the coat hanger like that and then tie it on to the rubber band so that it 's hanging over the the the bottom part of the coat hanger so do that whichever way your which ever wear your coat hanger is make your cups so that they can hang on your coat hanger so here I 've got in one all ready to go that I pop on here and I pop on here and then if I hold it by my finger you can see at the moment the cups are balanced they 're hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in to one side and nothing in to the other talk to your grown-up what do you think is going to happen if we put something in to one side and not in to the other side now what will happen if we put something in to both sides talk to your grown-up about what can happen when we 've got a different thing in both sides of our balance so what you can try now is your longest thing from your discovery box and your shortest thing from your discovery box now which cup is going down more if we look at our coat hanger can you see how this side has dropped down a bit lower than that side so the ruler is heavier than the magnet so you 're now going to test lots of things to see which is heavier or will they balance and be both the same so that at the bottom of our coat hanger stays level if they 're balancing and they 're both the same weight but before you do you need to have a guess first because scientists always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think is going to happen so some of the things that you might choose to test are some stones you might choose to test some stones I 've got a couple of different stones here they look about the same size but what will happen when you put them in have a guess first which one do you think will be the heavier one so that 's something you might test you might test some different sized spoons which one do you think will be the heavier one or will they be the same you might test some different sized toys or toys made from different materials so this one 's a metal one and this one 's a plastic one which one do you think is going to be the heavier have a guess first you might put in a banana and a peach which one do you think is going to be heavier you might raid mom or dad 's wallets for some different coins which coin do you think is going to be the heaviest coin how many coins how many ten senses do you put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some ideas but let the children do some thinking what would they like to test in their coathanger balance now when you 've made your guess and you do your test some of you might think oh I got that right or oh I got that wrong but you didn 't in actual fact in science we don 't usually talk about right or wrong we talk about whether we got an expected result or an unexpected result so make a note of the ones that the results that you got that we 're expected that the ones you thought were heavier that actually were and the results that were unexpected okay go and have some fun doing some weighing now we 're going to make something using our skills that we 've just learned with balancing we 're going to make a mobile now normally you would be provided with a kit that had pipe cleaners or chenille stems and some pop sticks and some string to make a mobile that looks like this so if you 've got those things at home you can still do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your strings to tie them onto the small pop sticks and then have a larger pop stick at the top and you 've made a mobile but not all of you will have those things at home so you might want to improvise using things like these so here we 've got a chopstick at the top some pencils and some toys to make our mobile or instead of the chopstick at the top you might like to use your coat hanger and you don 't have to use these sorts of toys other toys that you might use could be some animals or some little soft toys whatever you would like to use trying to make a mobile that is a couple of levels so we 've got a big level at the top and then a couple of other levels that our items are dangling from so these pieces of string are about 30 centimeters in length and you need seven of them one two three four five six seven and you need two straight things for them strings to tie on to so that 's something for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well before a next session I 'd like you to try and do lots of measuring so you could measure how long things are using a tape measure or a ruler you could do some timing perhaps with if you 've got a timer or with a phone or a clock with the second hand perhaps time how long you 're in the bath or the shower that 's something you could time lots of things you can time have some more thoughts about that and you can also use your balance that you 've made your a balance to see which thing is heavier or you might have at home a kitchen scales or bathroom scales that you could put things on but before you do that have a guess make a prediction which item do you think is going to be the heavier one now next week we 're going to be doing more experiments and you will need a boiled egg or some grapes so for one of the experiments you 'll need a boiled egg or some grapes so grownups can you boil the egg before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use and you 're also going to use a couple of the things that we spoke about last time like blue tack and salt okay so lots of measuring this week and make sure you record what you measure because it can be really hard to remember what you measured if you don 't write it down okay have have a lot of fun doing some science together measuring and recording [Music]"

I am in charge of the submission of this stew jointly hosted by the city of Ryde and Cass. Through this video workshop, you can make a difference at home. I would like to share with you some ideas and clicks on what to do next to creating a work of art. Even if you are talking about Eastwood, I would like you to create a work that reflects the place in people 2d. When you are done, you can submit it as Category Mother After collecting all of them and making them into a washable joint design, I would like to install this work in the heart of this neighborhood. Sin 's art works are mainly tapestry. It uses and transforms traditional weaving patterns and art styles from various cultures in Asia to create works that preserve a modern I create Many of my works are based on the uniqueness of the Ryde region and my personal relationship with myself. Let 's start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can probably think of concrete places in a list of man-made environments, like streets, buildings, etc. You can also think of nature. Do you have anything? Also, these stows serve delicious food. How can you visually describe the taste of the food sold in a certain place In my case, maybe in two weeks, the community, the people who live there, and their stories will come to I don 't know maybe it 's emotions. What emotions come to mind when you go to this In distant activities, I want people to express their creativity to the fullest when you live in our neighborhood Lacquer is a great way to visually express culture and emotions because it is beautiful and beautiful. Now, the next step is to decide how to create the work. Pen, pencil, water, flash, embroidery, color, very yu, in fact, digital painting, etc. You can always use it. Personally, So I prefer ink brushes when I draw a lot of this type of drawing, what color is black, anything is fine if you 're a fan Another way to draw is to print money from an image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn 't have to be perfect A rough but expressive piece can sometimes help tell a stronger story.

    "text": "[Music] hello my name is Wendy and I 'm from children 's discovery in Sydney and this is the little bang Discovery Club a program especially for young children preschoolers aged three to five years or children who have just started primary school up to about year two and you should all have an adult with you as your co learner now the little being Discovery Club is all about how science works and in this situation you 're going to be working as a team with the child and the grown-up together but the child is the junior Discoverer and the grown-up is their lab assistant so we want the children to be doing the thinking and the adults are there to help them if they need help with something now it 's okay for your child to be playing during this session so if they seem to be perhaps a bit off task and doing something that doesn 't seem to be quite what they 've been asked that 's fine because children learn through Play so ask them what they 're doing ask them what they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what they 're at where their imaginations take them so it 's quite okay for your child to be playing and seeming to be not doing well how you do it because they 're doing things their way and we want to encourage that during this program now there are four sessions to the little being Discovery Club and it 's probably a good idea for you to pause the recording and do the activities and then come back to it so I 'm going to be showing you some things you 'll probably want to pause and do them and then come back to see what 's coming up next now the first session today is all about how to be a good Discoverer and one of the things that scientists like to do is to collect and classify things or sort things so I 'm going to ask the children some questions and I 'd like you to talk to your grown-up about these things now children who likes to look at the Stars and the moon so tell your grown-up if you if you 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky and now have you ever noticed that the moon can be out during the day and have you ever wondered why that happens that 's the sort of thing that scientists do they see something and they wonder why what about looking at the Stars children tell your grown-up if you 've looked at the Stars and have you ever seen them twinkle do you know the song twinkle twinkle little star you might like to sing it together right now have you ever seen the stars twinkle have you ever wondered why they twinkle that 's the sort of thing that scientists do see something and wonder why and now who likes to go to the park to play now we can 't actually do that at the moment but think back to the last time you enter the park and do you have a favorite piece of equipment that you 'd like to go on and on and on over and over again and you 're your grown-ups can 't get you to get off the slide because you just want to keep sliding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to do things over and over again so and here 's a question for the grown-ups are your children always asking you why but why that 's what scientists do as well they ask lots of questions so you can see that the children are already really good at science they like to look at things they like to do things over and over again and they like to ask questions and they 're all things that scientists do now what we 're going to do first up is have a go at something that scientists likes like to do and that is they 'd like to sort things or the special word that they use for that is to classify things now I want you to look around the space that you 're in at the moment now it might be inside it might be in an outdoor space wherever you happen to be and look around are there things sorted in special places so if you have noticed behind me we 've got lots of things here that are sorted into containers have you got things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place so tell your grain now talk to them about what is in the space you 're in that 's been sorted and put away in a special place now for example if I was wanting to use a pair of scissors right now I know that I could go to the stationery hub on the table over there and they 'd be waiting for me is there something in the space that you 're in that you know that if you wanted it you could go and find it very easily so that 's one of the things that scientists like to do now we 're going to do some actual examples of sorting and the first thing we 're going to try and sort ah some socks so in a moment I 'm going to ask you to go and get some socks and try this activity so first of all you 've probably got us but where your socks live so are they in a you know cupboard on a shelf or in a drawer probably all kept together and they might all be nicely folded up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of socks from this pile would be these ones with the love hearts on them so that would be my favorite pair of socks and if I was not wearing socks already today and I was ready to go out and I needed to go and get my socks I 'd go to my special spot where they 're kept which at my house is in a drawer I 'd open up the drawer have a look inside ah here 's my favorite pair of socks I 'd like to wear today and I 'd put them on and that took me no time at all to do now scientists also like to sort things to make them easy to find but if your socks weren 't in their pairs folded in their pairs but we 're all separate do you think they 'd stay in their spot next to their pair would they all stayed nicely arranged in their pairs like this or do you think they 'd get all messed up talk to your grown-up what do you think would happen would they stay nicely in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they 'd get all mixed up what do you think might happen I think this is what might happen you might have a different idea though it could work the other way now if I 'm trying to find my favorite pair of socks this time I go to my drawer and everything 's in a mess and oh here 's one of them what is the other one ah found it okay now I can put on my socks and off I go see how much longer that took me now can you imagine if as well as having your socks all mixed up in one spot you had your hats and you had your t-shirts how long do you think it would take you to find your favorite pair of socks now hmm oh here 's one these hats are in the way ah yeah got it now so you can see that by sorting things and with your socks keeping them in their pairs folded up without all this other stuff in the way it 's much quicker and easier to find what you 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sort or classify things because it makes them easy to find and it helps them explain what 's going on and it helps us to understand so whenever you 're doing sorting you 're being a scientist now what I 'd like you to do now is to find a collection of toys so I 've got a bit of a collection of toys here now when you 've got your collection of toys you could leave them all in a pile like this and say this is my pile of toys and I 'm just going to leave them like that in a pile but you might decide when you look through them that some toys seem to go together and some toys sort of a different and don 't belong in that group so what I 'd like you to do is to sort your toys out now you can leave them all in one pile if you like or you can start sorting them out but the children need to decide why and how they 're going to sort them so the grown-ups are there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do put that one over there put that on over there no that 's for the children to decide and the grown-ups need to ask their children what they 're thinking why have you done it that way so we 're going to give you a little bit of time probably a good idea now to pause the recording and do your sorting I 'm going to do some sorting while you do and then we 'll come back and see how I 've sorted it see if it 's the same as what you had but I would imagine that there 'll be lots of different ideas because there 's lots of different ways to do this okay now here are my toys that I 've sorted a certain way can you tell what I 've done and perhaps you 've had a similar idea this time I 've sorted my toys according to their colour so we 've got the mostly red toys over here the mostly yellow toys over here the orange toys here the green toys here the blue toys here and I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's got a bit of white and a bit of yellow so it 's sort of in the middle there so did you sort your toys according to their colour now there are lots of other ways to do it so after you 've spoken to your grown-up about how you actually sorted your toys and what you did we 're going to jumble them all up again and try and think of a different way to sort them so have a chat to your grown-up tell them what you were thinking while you were sorting if you haven 't done that yet and then see if you can come up with a new idea about how to sort your toys so this time I 've sorted my toys into the type of toy so we 've got the cars and a train here together so vehicles here we 've got our animals all together here we 've got our blocks here and the ball is rolling around deciding it wants to join the blocks so this is a second way that you can sort things and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with as well so talk to your grown-up now about the second way that you 've been sorting things now you probably think that scientists need lots of equipment to do their experiments they usually do need some equipment but you 've probably already got a fair bit of it at home to use and I 'm going to show you what you need to collect for us to use for the rest of the program so we 're going to go on a bit of a treasure hunt so I 'm going to show you all these things and you can pause the recording whenever you like to go off and see if you can find those things and we 're going to make a collection of items for you to use so the first thing that you 'll need will be a box to put it all in so I perhaps something like this or maybe you 've got a shoe box you can put it all in or maybe you 've got a green bag you might use or a bigger box so first of all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so I 'm going to hang on to that one for now now some of the other things you need to try and find have you got a pencil because scientists like to write things down and something to write on so a little notepad or some paper pop them in your box have you got a ruler or you might have a tape measure something that looks a bit like this or a tape measure like these so if you if you can find a tape measure that would be a good thing I 'll just put one of them in now have you got some string you 'll need about four meters of string so if you 've got some string pop that in have you got some big rubber bands see if you can find a couple of big rubber bands put in your box have you got some plastic cups so this sort of cup or you might have this sort of cup so a couple of cups to put in your box have you got a chopstick or if you don 't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use so one of those pop them in have you got a takeaway container or you might have something like a lunchbox that you could put in do you have any magnets now if you go to your fridge you might find magnets you might have a magnet that looks like a magnet or you might have magnets hiding on the back of these magnets that stick to your fridge so see if you can find a magnet that might be stuck to your fridge and pop that in now have you got a coat hanger either a child 's coat hanger like this or an adult 's coat hanger a metal coat hanger either of those you 'll need you 'll need a metal coat hanger at some point in the program if you 've got a child 's coat hanger you can use that one for a different time as well so have you got coat hangers and have you got a timer of some sort now this is a timer but you might not have a timer like this but somebody might have a phone that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock that 's got a second hand that goes round that you can use as a timer so they 're the things that you 're trying to put together into a box to use over the rest of the program and this is going to be called our discovery box now there are a few things you 're going to need as well to do to run some experiments later on in the program so let me show you what they are do you have any Lu tack or plasticine so these things if you haven 't got them already you can probably pick them up from the supermarket so pop them onto the shopping list when you are going to go shopping so some blue tack or some plasticine have you got either some eggs so we 're going to be using some eggs now if you 're allergic to eggs that we 're not going to be breaking them or anything they 're going to stain their shells but if you 're still allergic to eggs you can use for one of our experiments instead you can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next session but for the one after that have you got a couple of balloons and you 'll also need a glass I think everyone 's probably got one of those you 'll need a couple more cups whether they 're this type or whether they 're just cups from the kitchen you 'll need a bowl if you haven 't already put a spoon into your discovery box you 'll need a spoon and you 'll need about a quarter of a cup of salt and you 'll need a picture from a magazine or a newspaper so this is the extent of what you will need to do some experiments in session three and four so if you haven 't got any of these things pop them on the shopping list and when someone 's going to the supermarket they can pick them up from there now what we 're going to do now is I 'm going to leave you with something to do before the next session and that is to make a collection of your own so that 's what this takeaway box or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fits nicely now if it doesn 't fit nicely in that box then obviously you 'll use something else now I 've got a suggestion here for you one that I 've already made and that is a collection of leaves so I found these leaves in my garden or when I went for a walk up the street so there are some different types of leaves in here I 've even got one that 's colored red which is unusual so a variety of different leaves and that 's a collection you might like to make now grown-ups let the children think about the collection that they 'd like to make they need to talk to you about it to see if it 's a safe thing to collect and they should only be collecting things when you 're there to make sure they only pick up things that are safe and if they want to collect something that belongs to somebody else they need to ask them if that 's all right so try and make a collection for next week children think about what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have that you 've already collected before that you want to prepare for next session or it might be something new so that 's what we 're trying to do before next session make a little collection of something it can be leaves if you want to do leaves but if you let the children think about it they can come up with some very imaginative things to collect and then just one more thing we 've written a book to go with this program called the little bang book of discovery it 's just a little booklet with lots of ideas about what we 're discussing talking about during this program and lots more ideas for experiments that you can do at home if you would like a copy of this book it cost 15 plus 2 postage and you can email us info at Children 's Discovery org dot au and we 'll organize to get a copy to you [Music]"

a very nice welcoming area so it 's a very peaceful environment that 's a very diverse area very diverse it 's got a lot of different nationalities well we probably need to go back to the original inhabitants who are here over the aboriginal inhabitants call the volume medical and they called the area one who metal in terms of land grants the first land grants here were in 1792 and this is actually a very interesting case of I think social inclusion because the first to land grants were given to 2x Marines and the next for land grants were given to ex-convicts so if ever that 's an example of two different social strata being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it was a very small settlement down parramatta river and then in 1826 and anne 's church was established not far from here on a hill and around that church developed other churches and other buildings and services but the term ride was first coined in 1841 many of these people were were given grants of land some of them took them up stayed here married created dynasties other people weren 't actually very good farmers and sold their land to other people so it was a real coop it was a real mixture of God of experience and success I came in nineteen fifty there was a school shopping center here and it was the second in the whole of Australia it was a supermarket I lived just on the other side here which was a brand new development and that were older places but where you have macquarie park now were orchards and farms a big contrast a big contract where the Ten football fields are it was the rub in the council rubbish dump and its stunt there was huge black rats and the people there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is and after a while they they mode they push to your rubbish down and put pasta on top and now you are more beautiful three football fields since then the change double storey houses come on which was in the gun and they look so much of the city lot of charges was the Koala improvement over the phone progress now we came to Sydney and then we went to the displaced persons camp in Bathurst 11th of November 1949 well these days they called their refugees but after the war most of us were in the camps in Germany which was had the British sector and then with the Australians wanting work workforce we were allowed to come out to Australia for me being a migrant who migrated to Australia but 29 years ago it means a lot when I think of my family I think of someone that is very cultural de Versailles I have Australian husband have stepdaughters that sort of half Italian I have a sister lord that is Japanese I 'm from Bombay which is now mumbai I 'm Catholic and yeah my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city I 'm born in Lebanon as you can see from my strongly English accent English was my fifth language so I speak Armenian that 's not my mother language so I grew up in a household where it was relative no bar culture noble we just need we would we grew up as children who were told that doesn 't matter you know who it is everyone is welcome at home my parents migrated from Lebanon in 1975 and they were that my father mother always told me the story about how they were the last plane out of Beirut before it was closed for 18 years due to a terrible civil war and so I 'm I think my family is a really lucky story well yeah when their first night coming here to start with I didn 't speak a single word of English and I thought that I was in the wrong place I was ready to go back to Greece I said if you don 't speak English you have to go back somebody told me anyway it was funny because I was as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was my family was quite a shock to realize that the community at large one arm as welcoming you can be angry or sad for you it 's just too bad that no one else knows my way sorry go and it may be very conscious of defective dumb we don 't see what they see and have dear issues I um had a clot and I lost my leg on easy a news day I woke up and I was missing my leg so my life changed overnight I rival push by the hamon I hear a car a pit bulla and quiz bowl baby comedic Hereward having with you for this ruler but I preserve several make out des well I 'm fine yourself a little can 't do it be allowed me don 't I tended fine awaiting feeding society should I ask you if you were in the wheelchair would you like it would you like to the powers that be to make things more it more comfortable for you and is yet to achieve I think the answer of that would you would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be it 's a shiny take whoa cuz I I 'll be reacting when I say something here you hold me get in you know it 's always really sad to see people who are racist discriminatory prejudiced behind that what I normally find is fear fear the unknown fear of taking a risk we look around the world at places that this art in harmony when you look at these terrible places where people like idly and children are dying or people are starving communities start to fracture and then you get to so many negativity you don 't get the kinds of community volunteering the neighborliness this the quality of services all of that starts to fall away if you start to lose respect for yourself for your neighbors for your from the community inclusion is very important bringing everybody to the table to make sure that everybody feels at all when I think of social inclusion I think of the kinds of concepts of empowerment and how we can get more people making the decisions that are going to affect their daily lives so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know like a verbal phrase it 's a process of doing I guess generally councils right across the country are about providing services to the whole community and that 's irrespective of what culture they come from what age they are it 's about meeting needs and also councils are a place where people come together without everyone coming together beautiful things like this just don 't happen so it is the great pleasure this aspect of social inclusion when you look at everything on the planner and trying to acquire with you the absolute bottom line is to leave in love people join in and sing along with us or get up and dance so clap or whenever you want to do actually this is very big as a huge huge your comments as actually sit for me so social reduce our social isolation I says to come here to make friends don 't stay home by alone yeah just go out find something find some people that was not project that 's potentially and we just did all the different countries because I own countries as you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth by being here to join this place here the West right have we call I enjoy getting together with the different nationalities charging ideas and have a lot of fun you could be you I 'm not really one or two sentences it says that a woman should since you up or call me so yeah puffins on to you need songs young when we are hooking come to something like we are we a Singaporean we pledge to to say that with the one there 's no distinguish artist about our language our religion we want to live together Harmons that 's what the pledges I remember one day this is very interesting one day there was a sports person on the television and said oh my God he 's a Serbian and she said no mother he 's Australian with a Serbian background and I love that because I thought oh my god you know she 's growing up to be someone to recognize that cultural heritage but also sort of embrace the Australian and what we stand for he so it was wonderful and then hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students or how they see employment opportunities so when they become the bosses of the future that they 'll actually employ people with disabilities and and realize being different differently abled doesn 't mean that you 're less yeah we believe that parents helping parents make stronger communities I think that still needs some education around social inclusion because when you say social inclusion the first thing people tend to think about is socially to be included but it 's more than that because I think mentally and emotionally you need to make someone feel included it 's not just about sitting with somebody or letting someone sit next to you it 's about actually being able and comfortable to engage and to be comfortable with the difference you you"

    "text": "the NDIS is not designed for service providers it 's designed for people for people with disabilities and for families and so you 'll see a lot of things surface in the media about how challenging the change is for providers and that always actually makes me feel really good because it means we 're on the right path in terms of keeping the consumers at the forefront of that design so I think once all of us actually get our hands on the scheme and get to participate in experience for ourselves it will feel a lot less scary and if not we will adjust it and tweak it and move forward the scheme is being piloted around the country there are about 20,000 participants and the feedback is that it 's all working well for them the NDIS is also fundamentally different because the government will no longer decide how to allocate funding you will the money will go to the consumer and you will decide which organizations thrive and which day you will be able to take your funding with you to the to the services and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which services you like and don 't like and if if there is a race to the bottom then don 't buy their service go somewhere else everyone wants organisations to deliver a quality service and add an attractive price and that allows innovation and investment and I think the nuances of changing the market so that the consumers have the power for the first time is already translating to a quiet a different approach from many service providers in in how they engage people with disabilities the feedback that we 're getting even from people that are in the scheme at the moment is being treated like a customer is profoundly different this is exciting because the market facilitation and insurance focus is creating a world that until 2013 was not possible the scheme will include with physical intellectual sensory and other disabilities around four hundred and sixty thousand people nationally it 's about one in ten people with disabilities so it 's the more severe end of the sky ride in fact next year will be one of the first areas in New South Wales to roll out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand people per quarter on to the NDIS it 'll be a single national approach so for the first time you won 't have to worry about your funding if you decide to move I know people that would lose their funding if they move from one side of the street to another and so that 's all gone and a little bit of national consistency is a good thing New South Wales represents about thirty percent of the NDIS and so there are lots of interesting things in the works if you like it 's not all flowers and roses I don 't want to leave you with the impression that it 's raining cash for people with disabilities it 's not generally if you 're receiving services and supports now you 'll receive about the same amount of services and supports on average if you have more complex needs or some unmet needs at the moment then it 's likely the scheme will pick those up but the growth in funding and so scale that you 're hearing about in terms of doubling the amount of funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the unmet need at the moment around fifty percent of people at the moment that should be eligible for funding aren 't receiving anything and so the scheme will pick that up and address that so when you hear about the growth it 's doubling the number of people generally and that 's really hard for all of these providers in the room because they 've all got to figure out how do they double the amount of services that they 're providing in a three year period it 's not also just about the incumbent providers and this is a key aspect of the scheme they 're looking for new and different not just more of saying and so for example niche providers specialized services digital disruption is already starting to show this month at all if appropriately called tenacious left the UK and by the time we roll out the NDIS it will be parked off the Maritime Museum it 's fully wheelchair accessible and was built by people with disabilities it is the largest wooden ship sailing on the planet and so if you 're up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go and sail that around by straight you can such a service um would not be impossible under the current arrangements likewise um there 's a new group in Sydney that helps you get to music festivals if you don 't want to go with your parents there are uber wants your wheelchair accessible vehicle and I 'm supporting some work with people who are interested in creating customized 3d devices using using 3d printing and and that reduces the cost of accessible technology so you know there 's a lot of cutting-edge stuff going on and it and and it 's only just the beginning our historical experience with disability makes it very hard for us to see what might be interesting options we 're not used to being given choices like this and so it 's it 's easy to believe that the sector won 't create something you or that you won 't see that innovation but under the NDIS you and your families will can have control over the services and supports you receive and embracing that change will help create those opportunities you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future is in all of our hands"

    "text": "the ndas is a new way of providing individualized support for people with impairment or condition that is likely to be permanent or a developmental delay that affects their ability to take part in everyday activities the NDIS is being implemented by the National Disability Insurance Agency so you 'll hear the jargon of NDIS and you 'll hear the ndia so ND is actually the commonwealth agency that will be administering the NDIS program the whole idea is to provide flexible whole of life services to participants so no matter whether it 's the early intervention services that we 've been doing a lot of capacity building with over the last few years right through to also 65 years of age though there 's a whole lot of transitional things what I think is really good is that because the Commonwealth have the care of both the disability sector and the aged care sector then there then they will work out that transitional process between going you know when you hit the bump of 65 years of age and how that will and and how that will work so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one government level you 'll have more choice and control and so instead of an organization saying to you you can have respite on a Monday and a Tuesday and in the old days I used to have people say well you can have a shower on a monday wednesday friday but we can 't give you a shower or any other time right you 'll be able to say no i 'm not putting up with that this is what i want and this is what i 'm going to get included into my support plan and i think that 's the key when we 're talking about NDIS is actually having the ability to be able to articulate what are the goals that you want to set what are those absolutely what we call reasonable and necessary supports that that I need or that my child needs or that the person that I care for needs so the National Disability Insurance Scheme does talk about reasonable and necessary supports that help a participant to reach their goals objectives and aspiration shins and undertake activities to enable participants social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose is what you 're saying to help a participant reach your goal these supports include being able to pursue your goals objectives and aspirations increase your independence increase social and economic participation and develop your capacity to live actively within the community that 's why it 's so good to me that when we talk about social inclusion this is what ND ice is about too is that that people now can be more involved not be stuck in a in a little room down at a disability organization that people will be able to access the community just like you and I do and they have a right to do that one of the things I really want to encourage you to do is to start to prepare yourself around what is this thing around goals and aspirations what is this what is this that that I need my child or the person I 'm caring for what do they need into the future and really start to think about all those formal and informal supports it 's about absolutely capturing those supports that you need and start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because when you sit down with your support plan art this is the sorts of things they will be talking about there 's also a whole lot of workshops for various groups whether you 're from called communities Aboriginal communities or just needing to know more about supported accommodation or preparing and planning for the NDIS I 've put this sheet over there which is about living life my way getting prepared so there 'll be a whole lot of things that you could attend throughout all of New South Wales we 've also got some good information there on accessing the NDIS for new participants I think whilst it 's absolutely wonderful that northern Sydney sort of first cab off the rank first of July next year the first people to go across to int the ndia will be people who are currently in the system and as of the first of July it will be accommodation services and basically your center based day programs because those two go together anyone who 's in the system now we 'll go across to the ndia with the same level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got because we 're handing the funding over to the Commonwealth Government and that at another point down the track there will be some reassessments done on on those services new participants will be picked up after that so it 's meant to be around about a two-year transition in northern Sydney so so most probably in the second year new participants will be picked up on in the program respite and things like that we 're in northern Sydney anyone basically who 's currently in the respite system now we 're individualizing their packages from the first of July next year so that they will have more choice and control over the organizations and the types of services that they 're being offered even though respite itself won 't be transitioned into the ndia until later it actually gives you an opportunity to learn how to shop around right to go to organisations and say how much service you 're going to give me how much you 're going to charge me on an hourly rate wider your overheads all of those sorts of things we 've also got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the NDIS that 's also over there and more information for clients and families so thank you very much for the opportunity of talking here today you"

    "text": "my son is six and a half he 's in kindy in in school a mainstream school and he 'd been supported by the integration integrated funding from department education and my question is when the NDIS kicks in does this india 's right off the funding from a department education that they 're either saying that that finally going to disappear so just a rumor so i want to know because that going to be impacting the school the way of the school supporting my son one of the things that 's creating a little bit of what 's the right word fear the fact that addict and fax is exiting procurement and delivery of disability services so by by 2019 the department that Janice is talking about won 't be there in in the same way it is now that doesn 't mean that um all of the other government departments education health and so on don 't need to continue their role in disability we 've actually been watching some documentation go up where it talks very clearly about what the role of the what would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Health and what will be the responsibility of Education that documents not signed off as yet but certainly that will give hope to hopefully some really most probably clearer guidelines and what we 've had around before over whose responsibility is now there 's no way in the world that they 're going to withdraw you know support workers in schools that is the the Department of Education roll the difference will be is that your child will be eligible and receive a package and then you might decide that you want some additional supports in in school for those key transitional points or you might think the teacher that I 've actually got actually needs a little bit of a capacity building and that some some of the role of the Department of Education but the early intervention providers can come in and do some of that as well it 's sort of twofold one is whether resources will be included in package so for people like myself for the child on faq co-funding that had a services in a resources component so the question is what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are going through school and a going from one particular schooling environment to another like at the moment my son 's at a school that has a lot of therapy services but in a year or two his time he probably won 't have that is there an annual review process because the package that I 'd need for him would substantially change once he leaves that particular school so just understanding how that will work support planning happens when you need it to happen basically so we know especially with kids that there are key key transitional points where the needs of the child will change and at that point then you call on your support planner to go back and get your services reassessed the same as if a person was in it was in an accommodation services and their health might be filing and therefore they needed more support so they may have been on one package they get back to the support planner and and get that reassessed to make sure that it meets the goals that you have for your child so that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it some things like because you can 't access transport readily for your child cuz there 's an expectation that you 'll do that but if you need special equipment in your car then yes that can that is covered under the NDIS so it 's done on a case-by-case basis it was more the genuine sensory based tools that you use to help a child cope in the classroom and cope at home and though lots of things under the NDIS they 'll look at the cost of your services and say k how might we do that better and the agency has enough flexibility to horse-trade between different parts of the package in order to achieve a better long-term outcome so that sort of thing it would be very difficult to achieve under the current block funding environment whereas that specifically what the NDIS is designed to do the ndia NDIS has just released a paper or it 's actually a strategy on assistive technology so for anyone who child requires assistive technology for two Funi daily life or anything so that helps them going to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that every other family does you will be eligible for supports under that as well my daughter was diagnosed with autism 10 years ago and I have an assessment report but when I attended an information session at another place they told me that for entry into an NDIS I need a assessment reported is less than two years old so I confused whether i need to do another assessment for my daughter or the report that is 55 years ago is sufficient there is some confusion that people think that they need to go out now and get an assessment for their family member now that 's in most cases not necessary so one of the reasons why if you already have good information and you already have a connection with people that can provide supports for you around accessing the future supports there 's every reason to think that you will receive the supports that you need to support your family member if it 's necessary and reasonable but the point of the new system is that we want to get away from the old system where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassessment every time you want a new service and had to make some new eligibility once you 're eligible to enter the scheme at the different levels of entry that 's it you remain eligible the rest of your life the services that you might receive over your lifetime you know over the following 40 years or so might change in that time to meet your life needs at that point in time but it 's not a continuing reassessment you don 't want people rushing out to get assessment that is justice is necessary and I 'm pleased to say that most providers I talk to recognize that and understand that the department has said quite clearly than if the person is already in receipt of any funded services in New South Wales for example residential care or day programs then they don 't need to be reassessed they will become automatically eligible and I believe in yourself Wales its 42,000 people automatically eligible to transition from general I one next year so those people won 't need to go through a reassessment and that 's going to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make it much easier to transition through and you will receive very much what you 're already saving currently when you go across the line come July one next year my son has Down syndrome and is currently receiving or has been receiving the better start funding the support that I 've used the things I 've used to support him in that has been private therapy services in the form of speech therapy and occupational therapy we 've pretty much almost used all of our funding he 's only four and a half and I 'm just running I heard you talk about better start in fact sea of rolling into the NDIS i 'm wondering if we have actually run out of funding where we stand come the rollout in july one if we 're still able to apply i suppose to to continue with his private therapy sessions which I feel he very much needs its funding available for people who require support require therapeutic support so that 's what Haddix been funding in terms of better start and facts iya that funding has had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better start funding in the helping children with autism funding which came from the Commonwealth Government was time limited and funds limited in what 's happening and what 's happened in the Hunter and across Australia is in terms of that funding where there 's been outstanding amounts outstanding amount has been rolled into the person for young Charles package and there are line items in the new service costing and pricing the services available under the NDIS that actually cover their opinion supports but as Jan said there 's a much bigger move these days to attract what 's called a transdisciplinary approach so a number of therapist will work with that with that family developing strategies to work with it for the family and the other people who are significant in that child 's life to support that child there is space in the under the NDIS where private practitioners have registered to provide support and so there is capacity there will be capacity when this region rolls into the NDIS for private practitioners to register with the ndia and continue to provide your support you only need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to be supporting have chosen their lead to leave their funds with the ndia if you decide as a family that you want to self manage your funding and take that with you you can spend that money and wherever you didn 't fit it doesn 't have to be a registered provider so to your example yeah you determining that the best your best need is to use your local private speech therapist again that 's exactly what that the NDIS is aimed at and essentially what we 're doing is giving everybody that opportunity I put a 14 year old son and just going back there 's two sort of questions related to equipment you 're talking about now can go and get equipment when you need so for instance my son 's in the process of getting a wheelchair what 's happening with organizations like enable because we 're starting and we know it 's an 18-month wait to get one and he 's desperate for one now do we still go through the whole process and wait or do we wait for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already grown out of it and so in the second question was in terms of you 're talking about the therapies and things you 're saying that a lot of it will move over but will they individually assess the child and the therapy that they need because for instance we he 's got cerebral palsy and he 's been hasn 't had much therapy even though desperately needs at cause of funding within the CPM so well then he can sort of should I look at it and say he needs the therapy and then he can choose what he needs is that they way they won 't assess you I 'm at a detailed sort of level to work out which specific therapies you need it 'll be about determine given in given the level of severity of his CP what is um what is the ballpark reasonableness that in terms of you know the funding and and the approach within the agency that they should be able to support and then it 'll be up to you to decide which goals and and which objectives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously over his lifetime I would continue to proceed through enable we know sometimes that 's right that is difficult and it is a long process but I think you still need to do it because we 're still a way off you 're being able to access that through NDIS you the scheme funds reasonable and necessary they 're an insurance company imagine you 're ringing a blooper or a midi bank or someone like that so um they 'll be quite harsh about what reasonable and necessary means they don 't fund awesome n good they fund reasonable and necessary for example they won 't fund if you want to go to Fiji and do an experimental disability I 'm course you know they they won 't fund dolphin therapy because there 's no evidence that that works but what they will fund let 's say if you want a wheelchair the average waiting period at the moment for a good wheelchair is about 18 months in some cases that 's not going to be there anymore because they 'll fund you to go and get your wheelchair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with that and so i expect for example that 18-month waiting list to disappear fairly quickly those sorts of things that are going to be at a practical level what the impact is is lying there was a lot of press initially about people worried about the scheme being focused on physical disabilities again that 's not true most of the people in the scheme at the moment don 't have a physical disability its intellectual disability and autism making up about sixty percent of the scheme at the moment we 're doing a lot of work to make sure that when the NDIS funding comes in and you 're able to get out that the community is going to be ready there 's a lot of work we 're doing with corporate Australia and with governments across Australia to make our communities more accessible and more inclusive and it 's all being embedded I think in the next five years there 's going to be huge change in the built environment and the way it works for people with both physical and behavioral disabilities so we 're really excited to be part of that"

james griffin mp thank you very much for joining us and welcome thank you so much it 's a pleasure to uh provide some opening remarks um to to the webinar this morning my uh internet connection should hopefully hold up and uh we 'll give it a go but i too would very much like to uh begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land on which i 'm calling from today which is the gadigal people of the euro nation and pay my respects and indeed our respects to elders past present and future i 'm very pleased to be joining you today as uh in my capacity as the parliamentary secretary for the environment i 'm representing minister keane and i would like to very much commend um the southern sydney regional organization of councils or ss rock on its paving the way initiative and participating councils uh for their enthusiasm in taking part we would all be very aware that joint procurement programs can and uh very much do deliver excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board and paving the way is no exception with uh the objective of creating an end market for about one third of glass collected through participating councils the new south wales government is also committed to achieving better waste and recycling outcomes modernizing the waste sector and ensuring a clean environment a 20-year waste strategy is currently being developed that will set the long-term direction for a sustainable accessible and affordable waste and resource recovery system in new south wales the strategy will set goals to reduce waste increased recycling plan future infrastructure and create new markets for recycled products it will facilitate the transition to a circular economy by ensuring waste materials are recycled and re-enter the economy to drive business and various employment opportunities as many of you on this webinar would be aware a circular economy doesn 't work unless we have sustainable and resilient markets for recycled products we 've all seen the impact of the closure of recycling export markets over the past few years leading to rising costs of waste management coupled with the federal government 's export ban on glass plastic paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage our waste locally and this means strengthening our ability to use recycled products right here in new south wales through manufacturing of infrastructure projects it also means we need to get the right facilities and systems in place to collect sort and process waste you would all know that these not easy tasks and require the combined effort of all levels of government the waste the waste resource recovery sector and manufacturers it means that we need to work hard to create pathways for recycled material to re-enter the productive economy through our strategy development we 've considered the most effective ways the new south wales government can improve markets for priority materials such as glass options have included boosting demand by using more recycled material in infrastructure projects develop developing standards or certifications for recycled content industry and government to address information barriers we 're also looking at ways to plan for critical waste infrastructure and to make it easier to develop waste and circular economy facilities i can assure you we 're working hard on the strategy to address short and long-term challenges around waste management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to releasing the strategy shortly our government is also support putting new recycling processing capacity with welsh replications earlier this month this is a 35 million dollar program co-funded with the commonwealth and aims to build new capacity to process waste materials targeted by the export ban this again includes glass remanufacture new south wales builds upon the significant investment the new south wales government has already made in the local resource recovery sector uh through our 802 million dollar wasteless recycle more program which was the largest of its kind in australia so once again i 'd like to reiterate my congratulations to the southern sydney regional organization of councils and the participating councils of paving the way for really stepping up to the plate and charting a new way forward for creating demand for recycled materials you are providing excellent leadership and taking responsibility for using waste that is generally generated locally and i hope that many more councils will be able to follow in your footsteps i think it 's very fair to say that there is almost an assumption now throughout our communities that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do and there is an expectation that uh that this is what um as local government and the state government these sorts of projects and initiatives that we 'll work together on to deliver a better environment and really help to work collaboratively to create a true circular economy so i look forward to seeing this project unfold i 'm seeing your successes and learnings uh applied and absolutely replicated across new south wales i want to thank you very much for allowing me to provide some opening remarks and i wish you all the best with the the rest of the webinar thank you thank you so much james and thank you very much for your for your reactive support and encouragement and uh yes i 'm sure a lot of us here are very much looking forward to getting that 20-year waste strategy so before we get going into the presentations part can i ask please that everybody use the chat function to enter any questions and comments you 'll find that at the bottom of your screen just click on that and the chat function will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all questions and comments coming in and we can if we can 't deal with them now we 'll be following up with an email after this morning 's session and as i mentioned earlier this session is also being recorded um a lot of people have been involved in this project and i can see that many of the names on this list that many of you have been involved in this project but our three speakers justin mark and kathy have been particularly important to the team so i 'll hand over now to ssrock 's strategic lead for waste and resource recovery justin bonzi who 's going to take us through the rest of the session time all right i think we 're good here um good morning everyone and thanks helen and thank you mr griffin for your fantastic opening statement this is a strong reminder for me the industry and all levels of government are close allies and the biggest shift to a circular economy australia has ever seen for those who aren 't familiar with us the southern sydney regional organization of councils is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs eastern suburbs cbd and inner west covering a third of greater sydney 's population of 1.7 million people these councils collectively manage about twenty percent of the waste in new south wales ssrock provides a forum through which our member councils can interact exchange ideas and work collaboratively to solve regional issues and contribute to the future sustainability of the region ssrock 's procure recycled paving away initiative has achieved a significant breakthrough for the circular economy by engineering a coordinated approach by 15 sydney councils to aggregate demand for asphalt with rcg as a substitute for natural sand creating a framework for the largest local government-led procurement of its kind in new south wales history it has created a local closed loop market for about a third of participating council 's domestic glass collections or the equivalent of 70 million glass bottles per year which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is already supporting essential infrastructural development in the sydney region a best practice contract model will monitor and report on sustainability kpis and facilitate innovation by enabling councils to upgrade to more sustainable materials as they become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs by increasing the value of curbside glass aligns with state and federal circular economy and government procurement policies and sets a framework for future initiatives to increase recycled content and roads i would also like to acknowledge the significant funding contribution from the new south wales epa through waste less recycle more and other grant funding that has made this possible ssrock is guided by robust waste management and resource recovery principles established by all of our councils through our waste strategy steering group one of the most important of these is taking responsibility for the waste we generate and doing everything in our power to minimize and manage it ourselves [Music] as you 're all aware in 2017 china announced a virtual ban on imports of australian recycling which the coalition of australian governments followed up by announcing our own ban on exports of most recyclable materials this presented a significant challenge due to the lack of onshore processing infrastructure and end markets for these materials poor demand drove down the price of recyclable materials leading to huge stockpiles and drove up the cost of ssrock council recycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abc four corners report from august 2017 showing warehouses of stock powered glass this was the scale of the challenge but with the challenge came an even bigger opportunity to finally get it right by taking responsibility for the waste we generate and using it as a resource to drive a more sustainable local economy the question was how to do it when councils band together we can have enormous sway over the market and this is what ssrock councils did of all the recyclable materials targeted by the ban glass plastics tires paper and cardboard glass was the easiest to solve only about 65 of curbside glass has local markets in sydney with high potential and civil works high curbside recycling tonnages means high gate fees and a high cost of recycling a number of ssrock councils as well as councils across australia have been trialling recycled crushed glass and roads for a decade and have proven it to be safe and a well-performing substitute for natural sand it should be noted that this procurement targets only the low-grade mixed glass of mirths that is not used for making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher market price that ensures it will continue to be used for bottle remanufacturing through a series of workshops with ssrock councils the new south wales epa former rms now transport friday south wales wama natspec and other peak public works and industry bodies in 2018 we identified a range of barriers that could make or break the initiative these barriers helped us identify the solutions the biggest challenge in the beginning was a lack of awareness that councils had been trialling rcg in roads since 2017. demonstrating it to be a safe and well performing substitute for natural sand in 2018 specifications on rcg and roads were still in the making let alone aligned between local and state roads the next major issue was insufficient regional beneficiation capacity and demand for rcg to drive investment and if you do go to the market will rcg be more expensive the answer was no even councils that were ready some years ago to source asphalt with rcg couldn 't generate enough demand to get competitive or sometimes any response for the market so key here would be aggregating enough demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you who have tried to find accurate waste out of no detailed composition and end market data can be very difficult to find in new south wales data on material fate is often obscured by the protection of the environment operations or poe act and mers don 't readily provide it given commercial sensitivities so we had to get resourceful then make the best assumptions we could a major part of this was commissioning an rcg value chain analysis analysis from our project engineer mark wood who was able to piece the story together from data and industry conversations the main thing here was understanding how much surplus glass ss rock generates and not taking glass away from bottle remanufacturing to bring together council teams whose responsibilities rarely overlapped we form the working groups with each team whom we engage systematically with the information most relevant to them emphasizing how each team fit into the bigger picture finally was change change can be risky but doing nothing in response to the systemic shocks that spawned this initiative was even riskier as you can see here all change is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end markets sorry you know i wasn 't gonna let you out without without a cheesy waste joke so at least it was a good one on the specifications so the game changed in 2019 when nat spec and transport for new south wales updated their specifications to allow up to 2.5 percent rcg in the wearing course and 10 in each the base and sub base though roads perform well with higher percentages these tolerances were capped to allow for accumulation of rcg through subsequent milling cycles collaborations with nat spec and transport from new south wales were crucial we worked very closely with nat spec to lay the groundwork for local road specifications based on council trial data then with transport for new south wales to align specifications for local and state roads establishing minimum rcg content in asphalt to meet recycled content requirements and align strategies to preference rcg and parallel market approaches in 2019 all 11 ssrock councils signed an mou to prioritize recycled materials and procurement strategically released the day before the kodak export ban timeline was announced this signaled that councils were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this enabled councils to signal a non-binding policy position and collaborate on a common procurement framework while engaging council gms and ceos to date to delegate key staff new south wales minister for energy and environment matt keane and minister for local government shelley hancock lent strong support in the media release which further legitimized the initiative this was also an effective way to reach out to non-ssrock councils as recycled content is is very much on many council 's radars an exciting outcome to our work with transport for new south wales was this guide on the use of rcg in asphalt designed to put the question of whether rcg was ready for widespread use to rest it was a great collaborative effort ssrock provided the coordination and perspective of council engineers transport for new south wales provided expertise on state road specifications strong leadership and confidence to stakeholders with regular updates to the new south wales transport minister the new south wales epa advised on the resource recovery order and exemption for recycled glass sand and other sticky regulatory concerns dpime advised on the state of end markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeline as you can see the procurement was a long time in the making initiated in 2018 and culminating this year with our sustainable pavements contract with 24 suppliers collaboration throughout this entire process as you can see was absolutely critical so what has this accomplished demand from ssrock and transport for new south wales will more than double demand across the state with about 20 000 tons per atom from each the initiative has rerouted the 15 percent of sydney glass previously sent to victoria in south australia for use in civil works and wine bottles this will now be recycled locally without taking higher order glass away from container deposit bottle to bottle outcomes while local glass will replace sand from distant quarries this translates to a big reduction in greenhouse gas emissions perhaps most remarkably this has created a market for all recoverable surplus glass in participating council areas so it took me a while to figure out this fancy little fireworks animation so i 'm going to let you enjoy it for a few seconds and that 's probably oh maximum enjoyment thank you justin always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good so there has been a flurry of investment including government grants and d.a applications for new beneficiaries and capacity upgrades to existing ones in terms of cost not only did rcg not come at a premium the contract will achieve up to a 20 cost savings for participating councils demonstrating that sustainability doesn 't need to cost more the contract also has built-in monitoring and reporting of volumes of recycled materials used and greenhouse gas emissions avoided as well as an innovation clause that allows councils to continually upgrade to more sustainable materials so as you can see this wins on all fronts driving economic stimulus and jobs solving the surplus glass problem and showing the community that councils are working hard to ensure every last bottle they put in the recycling bin is indeed recycled so what 's next we 're currently developing digital communication assets for participating councils to emphasize the community 's important role in a circular economy through proper recycling and that councils are working to ensure every last bottle that goes into the yellow lidded bin will be recycled we 're collaborating with deepon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental economic and social impacts of the initiative which will also be used as a case study for state government procurement targets the first roads with rcg as part of this contract will be laid from july 2021 and after glass we 're already scoping the next very exciting phase of paving the way leveraging the innovation clause in this contract to increase the use of recycled plastics and roads and more sustainable concrete so this is the first of hopefully many advances in road sustainability to come thank you for listening everybody i would now like to introduce mark wood to discuss our procurement and contract model with over 30 years experience in local government engineering mark has extensive experience in road pavement and waste management and recycling monk developed an interest in the sustainable reuse of materials to reduce the reliance on natural materials for road construction in the late 1990s with the initial use of crushed concrete as granular pavement in 1996 the trial of blast cullet as a coarse sand replacement in 2010 through to the 2018 road resurfacing project to demonstrate the use of recycled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark possesses several qualifications including the master 's degree in local government management and civil engineering qualifications we 'll see you mark thank you thanks justin um hello everyone i 'm presenting today on as justin pointed out the contract development process and the outcome of the tender so the process of any joint procurement contract is to ensure that the contract meets the needs or requirements of of participating councils so in this case we had um originally had 11 ss rock councils to consult with and what we did there we had individual meetings were held with each of the councils with the purpose of these meetings to seek feedback on their current contract requirements and we had this discussion about basically what was working well uh what can be improved and what would you like to see in a future contract as well as consulting with the councils we undertook uh eci which is early contractor innovation intervention sessions where ss rock invited the asheville road construction and waste recycling industry to participate in an industry forum the forum was a success in that we had 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask questions and make comments with some anna moody to help us develop the tender specifications this this slide here is basically just a simple uh layout of the timeline for the procurement process which was developed as part of the procurement plan which we developed back in june 2020. i think a particular note is to make sure you allow sufficient lead time in those early stages for consultation with both councils and industries in this contract it was extremely unhelpful for developing the specification and to document the kpis for the tender documents overall the procurement has gone to plan with councils now in the process of seeking endorsement from their councils and to start the contract on the 1st of july so based on um consultation with the from participating councils and the industry forum forum a set of i guess guiding principles for the tender specifications was developed and these were a sustainable procurement process this this required the suppliers to provide details on their business sustainability practices including some of the recycled products recycling waste disposal or energy and water saving practices we also included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to create a contract that provided some certainty to the market for rcg to be embedded into the ashford materials supply chain we 're also looking for the contract to measure other recycled products such as the use of wrap crumb rubber as well as increasing demand for these products the next one was the collaborative focus as just justin pointed out but it was very important and has also indicated the previous slide the development of a tender specification and a contract model had to have a collaborative focus in that is that the extensive consultation with council industry to make sure the contract would meet the needs of of industry and councils we also looked at having a longer term contract so for this contract we 've actually gone for a three year plus two years options a longer-term contract was needed as the recycling sustainability objectives do require some longer lead times in order to measure the success of the contract so hence we were for a longer contract the next issue we had there was sustainability reporting as um an issue was i guess identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current construction contracts there was a lack or no reporting on any sustainability measures um so we include that into the contract and the last one here we 've got is performance reporting and that 's performance reporting not only for the contractor suppliers but also for councils so the current contracts being used by councils specified some reporting requirements but the problem was there was little follow-up on these reports once the contract had been had been signed uh a pcg was developed for the procurement process um and the pcg uh worked on the tender specifications in the contract model as in the sooner slide it was agreed that the contract would include the seven service specifications so four of the specifications supply of asphalt supply and layer of asphalt mill and fill and asphalt patching include the use of recycled crushed glass in the pricing schedule the other three specifications concrete pavement patching pavement stabilization and pavement rejuvenation we 're all including because they met sort of the requirement of having sustainable pavements for road construction overall the second section there is contract performance so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key requirements as during the consultation phase so previous contracts basically measure performance on timeliness and price so they 're basically economic indicators and whilst these are really important it was decided to expand the kpis to include other things so we 've included environmental reporting in the in the kpis we 've got resource efficiency so we 're looking at the percentage or tons of recycled product supplied to councils we 're looking at energy carbon emissions by that we 're looking at energy and carbon reporting from the asphalt supply so they already do that as part of the regular reporting for through their supply chains we 're looking at uh waste to landfills so we 're looking for diversion from landfill from excavated or milled materials so we know what percent of material that is milled out of roads is actually used back into asheville and or or it is um does go to landfill um we 're looking at economic or financial reporting so we 're looking at the dollars per tonne the rate unit rate still is a ton or dollars per square metre we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program timelines for suppliers to actually deliver their programs in accordance with the works we 've also got a uh innovation innovation requires the suppliers to report monthly on any innovation or changes to improve the service delivery or products this will be achieved by introducing innovation register into the contract reporting framework all of these performance criteria will be supported by the ssrock management and governance structure to create and record the monthly supply reports and report accordingly to the participating councils and to meet the suppliers on annual reporting meetings so the contract model i guess with the contract model they 're probably now two traditional contracts being used across the road construction industry one is the supply contract suppliers are requested to build or quote for a package that works for an online tender portal such as vendor panel and this contract is supported by a pricing schedule which that which has a ceiling price or a maximum price for a range of services and in this contract the council would receive the best spot price for the works being intended at the time the other is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council intended them for a range of services engaged the supplier for a period of time with a set schedule of rates what we 've what we 've established with this new contract we 've developed i guess it 's a bit of a hybrid model for the 15 participant with so it actually provides some flexibility for councils on their individual circumstances that is a council has the ability to either use the supply panel by using vendor panel or they can use a contractor 's schedule of rates or a combination of those across the contract too so i guess in summary the contract model is you 've got a select panel contract supported by competitive schedule of rates with it 's a three-year contract with with two one-year extensions and um ss rock will manage the contract by taking up a 0.75 management fee the last point i 've got there is the project governance right now project governance for for the development of the tenant specification and corp is also critical the the pcg that was formed from all the participating councils represented the key functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pcg we had some specialist staff from councils from engineering uh the procurement areas um sustainability and resource recovery as well as developing the tender docks another key role of the pcg was to keep all the other participating councils informed this was untaken by online workshops and meetings during the covered lockdown period last year and as mentioned earlier the pcg was instrumental and representing all of the councils for the earlier contract innovation intervention said so at that at that workshop so i just want to touch here on the um i guess the four key causes within the contract which which is solved which are improving i think on current contracts the first one that we 've got there is kpis is monitoring evaluate performance so what will happen here is this rock will monitor the successful vendors performance through the agreement with kpis which have been stipulated so that includes timelessness of the service provisions of management of your accuracy of the reports which are submitted some compliance with the agreed performance indicators which we touched on before about resource efficiency or recycled products um energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also require suppliers to attend an annual performance review meeting conducted by ssrock the second course we 've got there is benchmarking in particular benchmarking across the zones so this clause has been included for councils to view the unit rates and quantities of recycled materials for all of the participating councils and they can use this to look at ways improving their own performance for delivery of services so an example here may be that a council may be having a different unit rate to a surrounding council so what they can look at there is why this has happened and they can also maybe look at maybe something as simple as the way they 're programming their work so it 's costing you more to get the works done we 've also they 've got reporting so which also all suppliers will provide a monthly report the monthly report will be logged through a a online portal so nss rock will be collating those reports and using the information to report on the kpis the fourth cause there is the innovations course now basically what this course here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce innovations across the term of the contract it 's particular potentially i guess we 're justin 's last slide what we 're trying to do into the future so this slot this particular clause has been put into the contract so suppliers can register what improvements or service they 're looking to do over the term of the contract so basically these suppliers will include any innovations or benefits in their monthly report we 'll collate that and put that in into into the contract reporting so that 's an important part of the course okay so the um tender is up so basically the tender the submitted pricing schedules um were all very competitive and provided councils were the choices as we as we wanted either a use of schedule of rates or to seek quotations via vendor panel from the panel of suppliers the the contract as we said is it is a select panel contract there is a competitive scheduler rates but it 's three years plus two years there is a 0.75 percent management fee from ssrock the important thing is we have now got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we estimate the value of the contract is in the order around 80 million dollars per annum one of the benefit or one of the things we came out of the contract there is no premium price for the use of rcg in asheville we have created a market for the use of rcg in sydney as justin pointed out before council 's collected glass is now being used in roads and we 've now got environment performance reporting undertaken monthly on on roads contracts so that 's all from me right now um i 'd now like to head over to kathy diezon who is the strategic procurement and contracts manager at ssrock kathy will provide you further details on how ssrock will support the participating councils by managing the for managing the contract thank you thank you mark my name is cathy vison i 've been working in the industry doing procurement for many years and looking forward for more how will this contract be managed ssrock will undertake the ongoing contract management for all participating councils in addition to monitoring contractor performance against kpis 12 months following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine the accuracy of our data and have we achieved a forecast by conducting an economic cost benefit analysis as a struct engaged prevention partner as the property advisor during the project and ongoing if required to implement measure and to report sustainability and procurement it 's always been a challenge for our councils to assist ssrap engaged a consultant to partner with our procurement departments in councils to create a sustainable procurement process supply reporting guidelines and e-learning tools it will also set a standard incomes and consistency in the sustainable procurement approach across our councils participating councils via ssr enterprise inventor panel will be assured that price increases insurances and licenses are current and up-to-date though we have achieved a very competitive schedule of rates engineers can also see quotations via ssrock vendor panel license vendor panel training for suppliers and buyers will be conducted prior to the first of july 2021 and as this contract is for three years with an option to extend for further two years ssrupt will facilitate the ongoing innovation of contract materials and methodology between councils and contractors during this period you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join our contract contact our office on telephone number eight three

    "text": "hello welcome everyone this afternoon to this panel discussion about earth canvas which is a really fascinating project that has involved a bunch of leading contemporary environmental uh artists working with regenerative farmers across southern new south wales my name is george mayne i work as a curator at the national museum of australia in canberra and i 've long had an interest in regenerative agriculture and what this really vibrant movement has to offer us all i 'll begin today by acknowledging that i 'm sitting here in the country of the nambri nanawala nunawa peoples and i pay my respects to the elders of the past and the present i also acknowledge that the farmland which is the focus of today 's discussion lies in the country of the worl where edgary people and in the context of this earth canvas project this acknowledgement of country to me seems to have a really particular resonance across australia as we know the the sovereignty of traditional owners over their countries was never seeded settlers mostly took the land by force often after many years of warfare and this violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traumas that continue today to cascade down through the generations uh and of course we 're almost at the end of nadoc week and the theme this year is always was always will be which asserts the endurance of sovereignty that indigenous people hold over the lands and waters of australia so there 's a there 's a lot of unfinished business here in australia and today we 're going to learn a bit about regenerative agriculture and that word regenerative means different things to different people and and i 'll be asking the panelists what they how they define the term uh but to me it 's a really interesting one in the context of nadoc week and our pretty brutal history it implies that there 's been some sort of a rupture a process of wounding in our past that can be tended to and possibly overcome to some degree but of course regenerative agriculture can 't solve all of the social and ecological problems that colonization brought to australia but it 's recognition of a history that damaged land and people and its agenda of bringing life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships allows us to to take a step towards a future that is hopefully more just and equitable before we kick off the discussion i 'm going to introduce the uh the panel members uh all farmers and artists who 've worked on the earth canvas project i will begin with jill sandbrook hello jill hello george so jill is the founder of this wonderful earth canvas project she has worked as a rural and freelance journalist in australia and south africa for 21 years she worked with david taylor managing pujonuk mourinho stud at jerilderi in 2003 jill established natural instinct instinct wool a manufacturing and marketing company that produced woollen corporate wear and today she manages bibiringa a cattle property near all bree in southern new south wales and on biburingo jill 's planted more than 70 000 trees which is an extraordinary figure over the last 13 years and runs the property along holistic management principles and soon we 'll hear from jill about how this fantastic project came together i 'd also like to introduce john woolsey so john woolsey is one of australia 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello hello hello how are you today oh i 'm very excited good so since arriving from england in 1976 his work in watercolor drawing print making and installation has explored and captured the intricacies of the living systems in which we are all enmeshed john describes himself as a hybrid mix of artists and scientists one who tries to relate the minutiae of the natural world leaf feather and beetle wing to the abstract dimensions of the earth 's dynamic systems his work which is held in all australian state and national galleries has received numerous awards and prizes over the years um and a few years back i was really lucky to see midway harvest which is a beautiful exhibition at the national museum in canberra and that uh exhibition explores the plants of northeast arnhem land where john 's spent a lot of time painting with young elder malcolm will pander and uh yeah it 's a great show and for the earth canvas project john spent a lot of time on jules farm bibaringa and today he 'll show us and speak to uh one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to introduce tony knott as well hello tony hi so tony has a masters in fine art from sydney college of the arts and his work also is held in national and state collections across australia for the past 40 years he has been a keen photographer has operated a commercial and fine art practice and has worked as an art educator he 's a former senior lecturer at charleston university and today lives on a farm near aubry and tony has played a really critical role in in this earth canvas project he 's been documenting through his photography all the interaction of artists with farmers and with farmland and his recorded interviews with all the participants so he 's got a really deep and thorough understanding of the processes that created this great show and he 'll be sharing some of his insights a bit later on and showing us a few of his photos and now i 'd like to introduce michael coughlin hello michael hello michael george how are you so michael with him sorry sorry i cut you off there just looking forward to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narandara a cattle property near holbrook also in southern new south wales has all these properties are that are in the show and since first undertaking training in holistic management in 1998 michael and anna have steadily turned their large enterprise into a successful model and inspiring model for the regenerative agriculture movement and over the last couple of decades their cattle and their land has become much healthier and more resilient and they 've witnessed this really striking rise in biodiversity across the property and i was interested to read that two listed endangered species have returned to the place and today michael will be introducing us to his property and talking about the painting painting work that was undertaken there by jenny bell who 's another of the earth canvas artists who isn 't joining us today and finally i 'd like to introduce joe davenport hello joe hey hi george so joe is a multi-award-winning contemporary artist who lives and works on the murray river just downstream from aubry jo completed a masters of fine art at the victorian college of the arts in melbourne and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery in sydney and for this project joe worked with the austin family on their property mandalo which is on the murrumbidgee river just downstream from gandhigai upstream from wagga and on her website joe explains how the abstraction in her art allows for a layering of meaning and that her paintings are never static but contain an element of spirit a constant striving for something just beyond the visible and when i read those words i thought they really helped us define where we 're heading today in this conversation as we 'll be talking about the thinking and the feeling that underlines that underlies regenerative agriculture and how these wonder wonderfully talented artists like joe and john can can really capture and communicate something of this invisible but very influential and informative terrain of the mind and the heart now before we kick off the discussion um we do have a very uh short film that will give you a quick overview of the wonderful earth canvas exhibition which is now open at aubrey library museum so if you 're ever in the district uh pop in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll kick off and have a look at the show earth canvas is a project that started in 2019 on the southwest slopes of southern new south wales between the murrumbidgee and the murray rivers involves six australians leading landscape artists and six regenerative farmers in the region and the artists were asked to go and visit the farms for a period of time and come up with a body of artworks that reflected their experience learning from the regenerative farmer and in november last year 2019 we had six open days where the artists the farmers and scientists and educators invited people from all walks of life onto the properties to learn about the experience of farming and artists so we were asking the artists to give an interpretation of how they see the landscape and then the regenerative farmers talked about how they see the landscape after learning from the artists the artists involved were jenny bell from goulburn of artist as well as a regente farmer joe davenport from albury an abstract artist ros atkins a printmaker from melbourne idris murphy from sydney janet lawrence an internationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape artist ecologist from victoria tony knott an art photographer also documented the whole process and joe just would like to ask you how was the experience of working with earth canvas it was a it was a rewarding experience working with the earth canvas and seeing how the regen farmers work seeing how they work with nature not against it working with what comes their way giving back more to the land than they take and still make a very good profit out of their farms really the way forward okay so that was uh jill they 're presenting in the little film and we 'll hear from jill in a moment and and joe are also featured in that short piece uh but before we kick off the conversation i just wanted to invite audience members to send through any questions as the conversation unfolds through the chat function and we 're trying to make sure we reserve at least 15 minutes to answer those questions uh at the end so send them through now uh i might ask jill we heard a bit of an overview there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to begin jewel by uh letting us all know what what the term regenerative agriculture means means for you because it 's a term that may be unfamiliar to many many people in our audience regenerative agriculture is basically working with nature and within the bounds of nature but also running profitable businesses at the same time but giving a fair emphasis when your decision making on on the power of nature and working within the bounds there 's no prescription to regenerative agriculture it 's just a way of helping build the environment cycle carbon through the natural systems and um working in a regenerative way yeah okay great and what what inspired you to develop this this project a number of things i had a um i was working with a group of 40 people from aubry in an art investment group for 10 years which was very successful so i learned through that a lot about art which i didn 't know um from a buying perspective a modern artist as such and i learned to look at look at things in much deeper detail i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized and then i started to look at the landscape but through the eyes of the artist looking at negative spaces rather than the positive spaces or the spaces between uh mata um looking at the small little um beetle lines that that john woolsey actually got me to look at those sort of details but also i 've got two sons and nieces and nephews and there seems to be a point in time i 've been around their university time and going overseas coming back and they 're looking at the world from a different perspective and they were coming and sitting in my garden room and bearing all telling me about their life and things and totally concerned about climate change to the point that they were feeling disempowered and they were throwing the blame back on my generation and totally understood this and that really did motivate me to try and connect urban to rural communities and also my experience with artists throughout stream to try and engage some of the artists that i 've become friends with and learned about um during that 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they didn 't really know what the landscape farmed landscape was all about so i really um that was probably one of my biggest passions at the moment is trying to rega re-engage everybody in the climate debate um because it 's not up to the farmers it 's not up to the governments of every person on the on the planet to do their bit for uh climate change and we can only do as individuals what we can do so like don 't take on i 'm not taking on the big issues i 'm just allowing people to come onto farms and seeing what we 're doing and how we 're managing yeah yeah i remember speaking to you on dialogue the open day the earth canvas open day and the way you were framing this project and really the broader project of regenerative agriculture in terms of hope um that in the face of of the you know this um unprecedented challenge of climate change there 's an awful lot of hope in this um in this movement so um yeah we which which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ george um regenerative farmer is about using the natural resources that we have so the natural resources the sunshine which is our core energy the process of photosynthesis that 's taking the sunshine taking the carbon out of the atmosphere and put storing it into the soil and feeding the microbes the fungi and also growing grass and then of course the water cycle which is the rainfall and how that that moves through the landscape and also the community dynamics the how all those systems make one ecosystem function so it is we are part of the solution anybody that 's managing landscapes even your backyard and growing trees and plants and how you process the wastage that comes out of your household we 're all part and oil part of that um climate change solution yeah yeah i get what you 're saying now um i think we 've got a few photos of divering it 'd be great to see those um because i think really what 's at the heart of this project is the country itself um so would you like to speak a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the of the character of the country which uh john engaged with when he was working on your place yeah sure thanks george uh this this podcast taken at the top of my place um and i 'm managing the property with when i 've got cattle on with one mob of cattle that move through the landscape i 've got a 70 paddocks and i rotate the cattle that one mob around the paddocks so they could be there for one or two days depending on the size of the paddock and the reason i put this photograph in because it 's a high point looking down over other farming property and looking over the hume where and beyond into victoria so really what i 'm trying to say there is that what i 'm managing on my place has an impact on the properties next door and the wider community in fact any water that runs off the ringer is only six or seven kilometers from getting into the murray river and even less on this southern side because it can flow straight down so i 'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property and by doing that i 'm maintaining grass cover for 100 of the time 100 of the year so for me grass cover being aware of how my management 's affecting other people is a really big consideration this image it triggers me to think how how my my canvas is the property but essentially every mark i make on the property could be a road a set of yards building a dam putting a contour in to slow the water in higher places so it doesn 't get into the gullies and cause erosion or the way i manage the livestock through the property they 're all marks on the canvas and it 's again it 's affecting my business and it 's affecting other people 's properties and the whole the whole of the country basically as it all oh we 're all connected all our landscapes are connected just because there 's a wi-fence around the boundary fence doesn 't mean to say that we 're just thinking about our own properties part of um earth canvas and a part of bibaringa is um engaging people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the earth canvas has been running a series of workshops some of them uh we 've had up to 100 people which is about as big as the facilities can take uh just talking about regenerative agriculture water and more theory type days with engaging politicians and bureaucrats um from the local land services as well as higher up the chain so these workshops have been hugely successful and we 've also run them with the artists so the six artists have been running workshops last year which funded earth canvas because it 's a non-profit organization uh and so to this point it 's all been money that we 've accumulated with between ourselves with the artists the farmers um donating their time their artwork their tuition it 's just been a huge job from a lot of people so engaging all these visitors that come and letting them hear the stories from the artists and the farmers has been a big part of earth canvas yep wonderful i think that idea you raised of agriculture itself being an art is an interesting one and uh we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah so uh we might now turn to john who was working um on jules place and we 've got a work of his to have a look at a bit later on um but john i might begin by uh mentioning your your writings and how you 've written about the way that artists can notice and draw to the surface the nuances and complexities of a place um and you know you 're a real master of that in your art and and and through this process really allow people to see and understand land in a new way and i was hoping that at some point you might be able to describe some of the characteristics of bibaringa and we 've just seen some beautiful photos of that place some of those characteristics that you noticed and captured and communicated in your work yeah oh yes i 'd love to describe that but first of all can i um say across i 'm i 'm in in the whipstick forest in uh near bendigo so i 'm talking to you all you uh you you new south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm not quite sure what i meant by that um but uh george you said something um rather wonderful to the border is it the border times uh you said this exhibition causes us to fall in love with the land which nourishes us i i thought that was so beautiful and i i thought it described so well what the painters of landscape we painters have tried to do down the ages uh how how we 've revealed and shown the nature of the earth and its teeming organic life um to the people who live in it and also to to love to love it and to connect with it and i 'm very fond of the words reveal and revelation which are absolutely key words for me as an artist because i feel that we painters of land are not just about making beautiful images of landscapes for the walls of our middle class friends it 's about very passionately i want to say that there 's a great artist landscape artists actually showed how the primary elements of this cosmos all work together rather as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and move in a great uh dynamic hole so the the the art the artists that we um absolutely adore we landscape types uh like casper david friedrich or turner or suzanne or street or fred williams or tim laura and and the artists in this exhibition um i i feel they from them we really can experience and feel the total dynamic now that was my little little rave but i 'll answer what your question now um i have to say that the rave was something i do because my grandfather was an irish preacher from dublin and he did very good sermons and he sort of uh he 'd like to do a bit of a rant but now that was a great great thank you greg this actual um project which has been so exciting for me was for me about looking at those vital energy flows and primary primary landscape forms um which you can find in in on on this kind of land now so in the paintings and i 'll put one up in a minute i 've concentrated on four fundamental land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the wonderful rounded hills and deep valleys of that uh land um i wonder whether could you put up the painting that i 've uh that you 've got there um and then in this painting i try to show how the water flows down the sides and onto into contour banks which send the water around the contours now i wish i had one of those pointers but you you 'll see you 'll see some of these features that i 'm talking about i hope um so the water goes round the contours and then percolates down the hillsides and then you can see on the screen how there 's these paddocks and rounded hill shapes and then you can see the almost cubist slabs of replanted trees you see um i i 'm gesturing away rather feebly and no one can see me um and so i i 've tried to show in this painting how they act as filters which and which slow the water moving down until it meets the creek and then and then there 's the disease amazing chain of palms can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river um the creek goes into these chains of ponds now i 've got the incredible can you see that on the painting yes now these are incredibly exciting for me because they have these aprons of phragmites reeds and the water goes into them and and then it goes out into spongy wetlands uh which are when you see the painting you will see then i can hope you can see the water moving into the next linked pond and so these kind of kind of chains of palms i describe as my very prophecy is my third primary landscape form or structure in this painting in these paintings and then um it 's because i 've i 've discovered how important this kind of slowing down the water is and these kinds of ponds um because this farm like so many other farms the water went really like down drains and as it right out to the sea um you know um [Music] and here so much of this is slowing the water down so some of my titles i 've talked about the fact that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the next thing that i 've got in here um oh yes i will actually well i wanted to say about this chain of pawns that it 's such a it 's a form [Music] of lymphatic drainage systems of the body and it 's in all manner of plants and this has been absolutely fantastic because i 've actually been drawing some of the plants which um uh uh have this system um yes so um that 's so what would you like to ask now well i just wanted to make a comment that there 's i mean there 's great beauty is isn 't there in the the ideas and and the processes of slowing down that water of of the country holding it holding the water filtering it uh the land coming back to life there 's a there 's a there 's a beauty in that uh and then you 're really drawing out and communicating something of that beauty uh as well as the you know communicating something of the intricacies of that process in your work um and you know and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as it was um before joel took it over to what it is now it 's um there 's a lot of uh you know beauty in in that story that you 've told i would love it i 'm glad you said that because the last thing i wanted to say uh related to that and that was that the one of the other exciting things about painting this land um is that the soil because of the slow water and because of the regulated grazing and because of the no plowing and all of these things is so rich and it 's full of insects mycorrhizal funguses and all the enormous variety of herbs which in fact means that the beef from there is ten times better than the beef from the the factory farms but behind me um can you see there 's a painting which is the one i was doing when it was too late to put in the show but this shows the um cicadas and butterflies hatching um with the kind of shade of ponds and things all up here um and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich and and living that landscape is and what 's rather wonderful about this exhibition is that one of the other artists jenny bell who is a simply marvelous artist uh her painting is all about the what 's under the soil if we don 't see um and um that was terribly exciting for me to have that in in in the show yeah yeah there 's a whole um ecology there isn 't there that that often is overlooked but is is critical um to to restoring country yeah yeah yeah yeah good okay well we might move on so uh we 've still got time at the end for questions so thank you very much john for all of that um i might just turn to jill now um and ask ask you your your response and you know as we 've we 've been seeing demonstrated here as john 's been talking and showing us his work he 's a real master at observing and documenting and communicating that that detail and that beauty of ecological activity that um can come back to the country when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriate way and um you know i 'm wondering if if the artworks that john generated on on your play store that um whether they were revealing any characteristics of the of the place that you hadn 't noticed before and whether perhaps you see your patch of land a little bit differently now i certainly do it 's been just an absolute honour working with john and he spent quite a bit of time at biberinga over the last couple of years and i 'm sitting here in the library now surrounded by his beautiful oils which normally he works on paper the paper studies are behind me but the oils are to my right so it 's just been lovely listening to him talk about them and me sitting amongst them um so john 's taught me so many things but one of the really um i like bold moments when he was talking about bamboo and talking about how he actually connects with the landscape and he said if i 'm drawing bamboo i have to draw and draw and draw it until i become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was talking about because so often i 'm traveling around the farm just picking cattle or you know planning something doing whatever and i just become totally absorbed and where i am and it the whole world could be blowing up but i am right where i am in that moment and i i 'm actually focusing on the farm creating being creative in my ideas and often um then i might just get a spencer or an excavator to come in to do some work on a contour to try and slow water down and i just have such a clear vision of where i want that to go because i 've actually connected with the landscape the other interesting thing john got me to look at is the landscape and he just he touched on it just now is how it reflects into the human body so he looked at the stream that goes through my property as the spine and then the kidneys and the lung and the heart are all connected there so it 's it 's a lot about loving where you are loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing the beauty that nature actually gives to us as farmers i mean i could not think of a better profession to be in as to being a land manager and a farmer rewarding yeah i mean the sense that i get from from hearing you and john talk is that there 's there 's a real dialogue that plays in there that the um the countries is communicating uh in in a way like it 's communicating it 's it 's it 's beauty it 's it 's complexity and there is a way that we can engage with it uh on those terms honoring it its power and its complexity and um responding to its needs and its voice and and that you know prep preps is um you know something that that is quite key to the regenerative agriculture movement it seems to me at least that understanding that we can enter into this into this reciprocal dialogical relationship with with country in a really respectful humble way absolutely um and and it came very clear that aboriginal people artists and now regenerative farmers we actually have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a similar understanding of the connectivity and being in the landscape and the landscape being part of us i remember when i first came to bibaringa when we were looking at purchasing it it was during the 2007 millennium drought it was grossly overstocked it was a rundown property which is exactly what we were looking for we weren 't even 100 meters in the in the gate and i we looked at each other and said this place has got something special now it looked terrible and it was a terrible time to be buying a farm but it was certainly an opportunity and we saw that and just being able to work with the planting of the trees or actually right in the beginning we had an aerial map with an overlay on it and we had a colored pens and we drew on that overlay of the photographic map and became creative because we really didn 't know where the boundary fences were we didn 't um we looked at it as a bare landscape and just looked at the topographical geographical um portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how quickly that all came together from that original what could be pseudo artwork yeah yeah fantastic okay well thank you very much jill for for those ideas and reflections um just in the interests of keeping keeping on on time we might move now to michael hello michael so michael i think you uh might have some photos of your property to share but before we um have a look at those i was wondering if you 'd like to give your definition of regenerative agriculture um yeah it 's um it 's well i think it 's much i think one of the most important things about um is that it 's much more than sustainability it 's improving the soil the biodiversity so water cycles and all that john and george has been talking about so it 's actually uh improving uh the land um it 's not just keeping it uh in the in the form in the present form it 's yeah it 's uh much more okay great and um can you tell us a bit about your your property mountain era and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came at it from a business point of view we uh we decided that uh i had some a really good friend who lived in sydney who was a warren buffett um uh protege and used to go over omaha to his agm 's uh berkshire hathaway and just loved uh loved warren buffett and he gave me a couple of books and i read them and i became interested i really wanted to make uh a really good business and at that stage i probably thought that to do that i had to go to sydney or do something off farm and then i loved what i was doing and i decided that we 'd make our farm a really good business and um and that 's uh that 's how we set about and the more we looked at it the more we read and traveled and uh all all what you do when you 're trying to come to an end point we decided that [Music] we had to dumb out we decided as i caught dumb our business down and um and just make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to we don 't have any machinery would we just we just really dumbed our business down and tried and trying to uh improve the improve the land improve the health of our cattle and all the biodiversity and everything that goes with it yeah yeah i mean i think it 's fascinating what what you 're saying about it 's you know hard-nosed business decisions here that are being made to create a you know really successful enterprise and um you know again this isn 't a you know a sort of a fringe movement the regenerative agriculture movement it 's um it really can you know promise um change on on a broad scale and for for many people so um it 's great to have those insights from you but let 's have a look at the the big artwork that um jenny bell created on your place and and can you tell us a bit about how it was displayed on the property uh at your open day and and how big it is because you can 't really get a sense of that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one line one linear linearly um not on top of each other like that and it was in a shed a machinery shed which was basically empty because we don 't have any machinery and um it was on the wall uh you know um 800 meters from from uh where anna and i live and um we anna and i had no uh inclination of what jenny was doing uh when she first came and spent time with us she spent a lot of time sketching cattle sketching calves uh anna my daughter and i were weaning and you know she spent all day just drawing drawing drawing cattle and then um and then this turned up so it was it was um it was a bit of a shock i suppose in a way uh but it 's just um just uh really there 's more you know there 's a saying there 's more stock underground than there is on top of the ground and uh and i think this um this this sort of hot really highlights that and the diversity and everything that 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all what joe and john have been talking about yeah so these are representations of of critters that are there in the biology of the soil is that right michael that 's how i read it um yeah jenny 's very shy that 's how i that 's my reading of it okay so um uh it looks like nematodes and god has what fungi and all sorts of things that you might find in the soil so that 's my reading of it yeah okay and i read that um that you joined up with this project because you you 're interested in just seeing how an artist might interpret your farm you know a place that as you described it you 're blinded to by familiarity and i 'm i 'm wondering whether through working with jenny and being part of this project you look at your place a bit differently now um well definitely um i find it hard uh you know to put my finger on it um i 'm sorry but um jenny is uh doesn 't go out and uh she 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of time with her um more over dinner than anywhere i suppose but she was wandering around everywhere and um um it just uh [Music] she 's passionate about regen agriculture as much as we are so it just went hand in hand really yeah yeah great so so what do you see is the value of this project to the to the broader public we sort of talked about what what it 's meant to the the producers but what do you think um the average australian who might not know much about farming or art what does it offer to them well i think i think it brought as jill said it got people on farms people maybe not normally would go on farms i think that 's one of our biggest problems in farming the perception of farming is a huge disconnect and i think art 's just a fantastic medium to to connect and uh all the works are just fantastic and they 're all uh they 're all zeroing in on on on uh on regen ag they 're all and and particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had uh we 've had quite a bit of feedback about it and um and uh yeah it 's it 's it 's it 's the movement and that comes in many forms i suppose and this is definitely right form yeah yeah that that the way it 's you know drawing people into um to an understanding of that the complexity um ecologically that his characteristic of the movement is something that i 've noticed yeah okay well thanks very much michael for all of that now we might move on to joe a little bit behind time but not going too badly um hi joe yes so you were doing your work on mandala the property owned by the austin family um i was wondering if you had a few photos there you 'd like to show of the property and describe it to the audience [Music] it 's a photo of mandalo mandalo is farmed by nick andy austin and their two young children and it has been in the austin family since the 1940s it is a 1450 hectare beef cattle enterprise property situated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gandhigai in new south wales and it comprises of river flats and open grassy slopes that have been contoured the farm is divided up into many paddocks so nick can um allows nick to move his cattle around so that they to um spread them out over the farm so to keep the grass at the right level so um not taking too much from the paddock at any one time yep great okay thanks for that looks like a beautiful place it is a lovely place it 's a really good place and then um i visited um the farm probably three or four times during the course of the earth canvas project and when i first arrived on the farm i asked nick if he would take me to um the special places on the property what he thought were really special so we hopped in the car and we we in the four-wheel drive actually and headed off over the paddock and followed the river until we came to this amazing um a rocky big granite boulder outcrop on the top of the hill perched up very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river so the bank of the murrumbuchi river there was a a long way down you might have seen in one of the the previous photos that you could just see how high that that bank was yes yeah and there 's just no doubting um the significance of it being a special place it was just um the minute that i drove up there immediately you could you could sense that um the sense of connection that you just knew that this had been a meeting place and a gathering place um for the millennium and this year and this is where i did my paintings from okay so they 're all all from that that point on the property yep okay i thought it might be interesting to hear hear from you what regenerative agriculture means to you seeing it it means different things to different people did you sort of develop a bit of a sense of what it means during the course of the project well i did when i was first asked to be part of the project jill asked me um to be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i wasn 't really sure how i was going to portray that in my work at all and i thought about quite a few different ideas and installations and things like that but they weren 't working so i decided to to go back to my painting and around this time it was a time that we had that devastating fish kill in the murray darling river system downstream where there were over a million fish were were killed dead and dying or for the sake of not enough river not enough water being left in the river system there um there was a lot of water down that area taken out in irrigation and and this formed part of the reason why um all these you know this happened yeah well so on mandalo they don 't take and um i don 't know about other regen farms but on mandala even though they 've got the mourinho river running you know bordering their property they don 't take water out of the river for irrigation they use different techniques the techniques of of contouring the land that um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the the water so as it trickles uh when it rains it spreads and trickles down the hill and they 're spreading it out and it also because it runs a lot slower it gives it time to to soak into the earth and and you get a much better grasp um crop from this and and doing that um it also holds on to all the topsoil so as your as the water 's running through the property it 's not taking any of the top soil with it so by the time it does um trickle back and hit into the to the river well it 's um it 's filtered it 's very clean and it 's free from most pesticides and chemicals and this allows for a really healthy river system and where fish and other um [Music] you know life under the surface can um you know can really flourish well so we have a look at some of your paintings because i think uh fish appear in at least one aren 't they yeah in the first one there should be number okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right at the the very start of earth um earth canvas and it was talking about um how when region farmers use their techniques the water is kept clean and and different species like michael were saying different um endangered species find their way back onto the land and into the river i call this painting um beneath the surface because with regen farming that 's where it all starts not only beneath the surface in the water but beneath the surface in the soil that 's the important part where it all starts beautiful and what do we see here one 's mandalo and this was the painting the large painting that i finished it 's nearly two meters square this painting that i finished um for the mandala and that was at the at the end of the earth canvas um just before the exhibition opened yes i suppose when nick and i decided for the open day when we were asked to come up with a theme for the open day nick and i spent a lot of time working out what we were actually going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nick 's idea that we should um talk about the elements the earth uh um air fire and water uh and how that illustrates how it 's illustrated in regen farming it illustrates that um that farmers have to work with nature rather than imposing their will against nature they have to learn to just roll with what nature brings along to them and and to use those so i think there 's some other little photos there we decided that i would um work with with the earth um using charcoal out of the the fire on the property just on the just near the top of that big bank there there was a lovely um fire that my campfire that i that i used i used the water out of the river um there 's some soil smeared um through that and these were my preliminary drawings for for that 's another one so i would also use a lot of tipping and pouring of water and just seeing where the water ran and um as it ran down over the page so trying to get the feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that 's really striking how you 're using those um materials um and really drawing on the character of the the place almost like you 're collaborating with the place to to create those works and allowing that that picture country to to express what it is in in your artwork and um yeah and the colors colors are interesting i mean there 's a bit of a contrast isn 't there between using those really earthy um textures and colors and pigments from the place itself and and then some of those more more um more more vibrant uh colors that you might see in in a wild sunset or something but um yeah the property the um i mean the charcoal is the color that it is and and the earth is that color you know so i was there using the elements in in that way but i also in my major work for the show they were the preliminary works in the major work i really wanted to um have a real sense um you know of the essence of the place of the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives you when you 're standing on a property when you can feel that um things are working well you know that that nature is doing what it was supposed to do that you can feel the the softness of the earth under your feet and you can see the cover on the you know on the ground uh you can see a very clear fresh water flowing by in the river and it does fill you with this absolute sense of optimism for the future and a certain um joy of being on the landscape and to me that um they conjure up that that feeling of of um optimism and joy for for the future of um yeah it 's fascinating how it really serves to um you know place you you know within within within that terrain in in a way through that emotional response that um people are responding to the to the the beauty of the place and the joy that it 's it 's coming back to life and um yeah communicating and in that that way is it 's interesting it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you you know you 're confronted with photos of dead and decaying fish in the river like how that we 're talking about how that um affects your mood you look at that and you can just feel the energy draining out of you and just think what i 'm doing but when you see something working as marvelously well as these regen farms do it does it just it um it 's um it lightens you yeah yeah yeah ways we can live that can bring bring about some good good in the world that 's right okay well thanks very much for all that joe um i might move on to tony now uh hello tony hi joe hi george um yeah i mean as we discussed earlier you 've had a really deep involvement in this project and you 're you 're a farmer yourself so yeah i was wondering wondering if you 'd like to share what what the term regenerative agriculture means to you well regenerative agriculture really is a very broad church but so it 's not really prescriptive the bottom line is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regenerating something and like michael said it 's not about sustaining something it 's about regenerating something and so your biodiversity really needs to to be increasing most of farming practice since the since the very early stone age has been about eliminating things out of the environment to make the environment comfortable produce more food and of course that happened in the 50s when you have the green revolution and pesticides and herbicides and fed a lot the world but at by reducing the biodiversity and i think that 's sort of come to the point now where that project 's just about exhausted so we really need to think about making the environment just not for us as as as humans but also increasing their biodiversity and making it for all life and to me that 's what regenerative farming is about yeah okay yeah okay there that real sort of diversity and abundance and inclusion yeah yeah yeah and that 's what and then and the work that i took in the photographs i took i tried to look at the theme across all the farms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil biology you know that 's the thing that 's really because a lot of people don 't see they see increasing biodiversity as just a few birds and some trees but as as michael says the stock in the ground is more than the stock above the ground yes right so my my work kind of concentrated on i although i didn 't use microscopes i sort of looked at those very small things that you don 't probably notice on a farm that 's actually increasing the productivity breaking down dead trees turning it into something that the plants can then use to to grow more food so it 's really the work of all those microorganism all the soil boater that 's really increasing the production on that property yeah and i think that 's really what regenerative is about is sort of like making making the soil much more active and all the little critters can live and and the beauty of all those things you can see in these little beetle tracks here yeah it 's all very quite lovely yeah it 's it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was really the you know the activity in the soil that seemed to be a really common um focus uh as you as you visited all those farms and well it 's the increase in biodiversity and and most of that increase in biodiversity happens where you can 't see it yeah and that 's what i was really interested in you know people people in this sort of who are not really familiar with it might think oh it 's growing a few trees and and and and all those big animals that you see the birds and you know furry things but it 's really about all those soil biota the fungi the little bugs that that 's they 're the ones that are actually making your production really work and yeah and that 's the thing that 's bringing the landscape back to life yeah okay so so as someone who who 's an artist and and an art educator and have been really involved in the art world for a long time i mean it 's really interesting to hear about the those uh you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of having artists involved in this project and putting on a show that 's hopefully going to travel the country and hopefully come to the national museum yeah yeah i um i 'm wondering what you really think that that artistic um approach can offer to to the wider public well um artists are really in a sense they 're like the canaries in the coal mine they 're the people that notice the very small changes that 's happening in the world they look at things in a very very deep way a very emotional and engaging way and they 're the people that notice the inner thing is that if anything is going to happen it will be the artist who knows it first and of course with the regenerative farmers farming it 's that involving artists they can start to then communicate some of those ideas to to the rest of the world and i think art 's really important in that is that is it it looks at the very minute details that other people might miss and it communicates things on a on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in words or in anything else you know like it 's that thing of like where where art involved engages people on an emotional level and that 's very important yeah i mean i think um you know what what you 're saying there about um you know sort of new and emerging ideas and and really a mood that is um you know occupying us across the world today i think it 's it 's fascinating how you know when jill invite invited um a whole bunch of these you know really talented leading environmental and contemporary artists to join the show you know they they jumped on it because they could they can they can see that this regenerative agriculture movement is you know it 's it 's vibrant it 's growing it 's new it 's relevant and it 's um you know it 's meeting uh and the that we have at a cultural level as well as at a practical level to um to address address these a lot of these big issues that we 're facing in the world today yeah well artists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yeah they 're picking up on all that yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure okay well thanks very much for all that tony um now we 've been able to keep pretty much uh on time which is great and there 's been a few questions coming through for the panelists um so i 'll have a quick look at those and uh there 's one here here i think directed at jill so i will direct this one to you jill um how does the marketplace respond to agricultural products produced on regenerative farms well good question um yes it 's happening definitely from the farms perspective there 's a few programs and one i 'm involved in is called land to market which is run by the holistic management savory institute but it 's an international organization where we 've got environmental verification outcomes it 's each year a property gets tested for soils and water retention and biodiversity it 's quite it 's a full day on 10 different sites on the farm so that 's what we 're doing to try and promote some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with provenia who 's a group of people from victoria who have a mobile meat processing unit that travels around onto farms and they 're it 's only small scale but they 're doing 10 to 15 animals a day which adds up over a week and processing on farm and selling them as grass-fed meat and low no antibiotics no hormones so healthy meat with good amigo um percentages meter iii and there 's also vegetable farmers grain farmers woodstock brains savanak they 're growing on heritage organic on commercial level selling tons of um ground stone ground uh wheat so there are a lot more products coming on the market so going to local markets going to supermarkets that health food shops that are selling these products or going on farm and finding out local producers that are supplying them is one way that consumers can show their interest and sometimes you don 't have to pay much more to get a nutrient-rich food that 's going to absolutely put life back into your family and children and one of the big big reasons why i went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children had some food issues um and that certainly got me thinking about the quality of the food that they are eating and it 's followed through um to their two very healthy boys now okay thanks bill michael did you want to make any comment there about um the marketplace and how you market your your beef um yeah well it just did neil the the uh some of the big players you know jbs and those those uh they have a grass-fed uh no hormone no uh antibiotic uh stan ordered uh standard now and uh another company we 've been dealing with is greenham 's which is a family company um and they do um they do the same and they also have an animal welfare standard which may be a bit rubbery but so it 's coming about and they 're interested uh greenham 's are interested in what joe was talking about the savory savory lanta market program but they won 't they won 't do those companies won 't do that they 'll just modify it and make it make their own arrangements but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass-fed market is just fantastic at the moment it 's making more money than feedlot beef and um i just can 't you know we can 't get enough of it so i think i think people are aware that um that the uh the health benefits of grass-fed beef and um uh if we can get a standard on regen one of the from being a regenerative farmer we one of the things is we tend to have live cost of productions because we don 't have the high inputs so we don 't really have to sell our produce for much more we 're still making good profit at the end of the day yeah fantastic okay we 've got another question here from i think from joe uh and it 's a question for farmers but i think it could also be a question directed to the artists and joe asks would any of the farmers be prepared to comment on a sense of the land speaking to them in new ways as they have changed their practice so again that idea of dialogue and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how that influences your farming and and possibly you know how the artworks are influenced by that dialogue anyone like to respond to that one okay i 'll have a good um i think joe mentioned joy um joy the joy of living and the joy of what the landscape can give and i think a lot of regenerative farmers have shown in research done by anu and mark gardner from up at dubbo that the quality of life that regenerative farmers have is actually on a scale higher than regular farm regular the average farmer so we 're spending more time with our family we 're having holidays we 're valuing the quality of life that we live joe 's question probably didn 't expect an answer like that but i think that 's a really important aspect of building healthy communities even though it might be a small percentage of regenerative farmers in the in most communities that if you look at those families they are actually more often than not um have more time to spend on those family and friends and quality of life issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes i agree jill um entirely and i think um i think the stress we were conventional very much conventional farmers when i left school and the stress and um the stress on the land and so now the land speaks to me saying uh thank you thank you and uh that 's what i feel and uh that makes me good what obviously uh what are expressed in those works is just another um you know another another reinforcement of all that it 's the resilience of the land that comes through to me so if we get a dry time it uh doesn 't seem to worry in our business or doesn 't seem to um threaten our business like uh it used to 20 years you know years ago yeah i think because we 're we 're pretty in touch most farmers are in touch with what 's going on around them and we live with climate that 's probably our biggest risk that we live on a day-to-day basis so we we are in touch with where we are but we also um as being with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching a drought and we 'll respond and be stock or in the good season we 'll increase stock or sometimes we won 't have any stock and just allow that in my case it 's what 's happening at the moment i 'm just allowing the property to have a break so it 's basically gone to church for a while and staying there until i can see some profit to buy back into cattle or get some adjustment cattle on so i 'm not concerned about that because i 'm building soil and giving all the grasses an opportunity to seed down so i 'm listening to the to the landscape in that respect yeah okay there 's plenty of questions here and we 've only got uh about 10 minutes so i 'll keep going with uh reading some of these out we 've got a question here from doreen who asks how is this method different from permaculture so i don 't know who would like to answer that one maybe tony would you like to give that a go well in a sense permaculture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it 's all it 's all about increasing biodiversity so it 's it 's it 's horses for courses it depends on what you want to do so permaculture is really is sort of aimed at a smaller enterprise but um it 's really as long as it 's increasing biodiversity and things like that and increasing soil carbon and all those sort of things it 's um it 's regenerative so sorry you go joe it could be biodynamics permaculture holistic management um but um natural sequence farming key lime farming there 's so many ways you can um do virginity farming i think charlie massey in his call of the read warbler um had a bit there on permaculture and it 's it 's a really good book that outlines the the different discourses and dialogues and ideas through the years that have led to this movement which is now being termed regenerative agriculture you get a sense in in that i think about how inclusive the movement is um you know the the great respect and engagement a lot of indigenous a lot of regenerative farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about grazing we 've also got you know cropping systems that are based on these principles as well so it 's a really good book if anyone wants to to read further on this topic uh we 've got a question here from uh naomi um and i think it 's interesting because it 's it 's it 's an urban sort of focus here and we 've been talking about those connections that regenerative farming can create between people who aren 't involved with farming and and with farmland and farmers could we invite street artists to regenerate city landscapes to bring awareness to regenerative farms and practices so perhaps joe or john would you like to perhaps say a few words about you know what role art might play in an urban setting that that links in with this movement whether there 's scope for that do you want to go john um i i must say i 'm very bad on anything to do with the city i don 't think i can um there are some rather amazing um street artists um doing paintings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there are actually some rather amazing um young artists who who are doing um world art and um i 've sometimes thought that that is the most wonderful uh way of showing people things like waders or all the endangered birds um and so that 's the only thing i could think of but then now i 've got the stage as it were could i just as we 're going to end um could could i say something about us spooking the wonderful catalogue that is now online um and so perhaps jill or uh george you you could tell the audience how they could um look at it because it in fact it addresses all these things we 've been talking about terribly well so jill i imagine that 's available through the earth canvas website yes and the aubrey live aubrey library museum or obviously website too so you can it 's right at the bottom of the link that people registered on you just go keep going down any of the links and you 'll see it it 's a 41 page might have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ john said um i just couldn 't hear anything but i can i 'm hearing you all back again now um street art oh um i think any sort of art is connecting us you know to feelings and i don 't know jill about that i 'd have to think about that a little bit more but i just think art is just a wonderful um connector and um that that you know that can show us new things in in different ways and and um i think the more art that we can get and the more connection that we can get to to people thinking about um farms and property and where their food comes from and um i think you know it 's a you know a great um you know a great opportunity for for people um to to put out um wherever they can okay i i didn 't really he i didn 't hear the question oh no i 'm sorry and then i didn 't really hear what john said so i 'm finding it really hard to um to reply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good answer to a question you didn 't hear um yeah and uh we 've got a question here from greg uh it 's there 's two parts to the question it 's probably one more for the farmers in the room so beyond increasing biodiversity how do regenerative agriculture practitioners define and share their best practice principles and is carbon farming developing with this as well tony do you want to try that well we 'll tell you michael um i can start with just say look carbon farming is again a subset of a subset of regenerative agriculture if you 're not increasing your carbon you 're not increasing your biodiversity in the soil because the very animals and and microorganisms that are in the soil i might have carbon so the more carbon in the soil the better oh what 's that sunshine so yeah that 's that 's all i 'd have to say about that okay uh if there 's no other responses to that question i might go to one more michael did you have something to say there um no no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really i think really well actually okay so maybe one last question before we wrap up for today and this is a question that goes to that [Music] the topic of connecting people with this movement another question from naomi and it 's is there a way that we can easily and quickly find out which farm be using regenerative methods uh and she also says it would be great to have a regenerative label like we have an organic label well there 's grass-fed beef labels in the market shelf now like greenhams and jbs and teas all have grass-fed beef and lamb labels so that they 're in the supermarkets now harris farms they 're just coming about to come to sydney they 're going to be stocking a lot of regulative type products organic biodynamic uh there 's the maloon eggs and holbrook paddock eggs uh hobo paddock 's a local farmer and sam and crew are part of the groups that quite a number of the farmers in earth canvas are part of so they 're all grass-fed and grass-padded grid um chickens produce eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're from mainly going into the canberra and sydney markets uh there 's chicken farming and there 's there 's a lot of wild fish of course um so there are a lot of products on the market you just have to probably googling there 's nothing like google to go and find where your lack of local suppliers of these are but we do need uh consumers to go out there and ask their butchers and bakers and uh supermarkets to start stocking them and walking with your feet um it 's one of the big things about earth canvas is to not just have people sitting around going to marches and protesting about climate change but actually walking with their feet and their consumer dollar and i think this whole movement of the climate change we have to into mitigation of climate change man-made we need to all be part of it and see us as um doing it not just talking about it but actually doing it and regenerative farmers and artists and teachers the whole education system universities right from the preschools the institutions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get them moving and department of agriculture land services all these institutions need to get educated in a different way of farming there will be people sitting at home saying that how we 're going to provide wheat and grain and rice and things regeneratively without chemicals well there are so many biological preparations now that can be used that this is not an excuse i mean it takes it 's more like a decision making they have to change their mindset to go out and get themselves educated and to make the changes they might be they 're slow doesn 't have to happen in one year but just thinking about biodiversity and how we 're going to build it and how we 're going to build the world into a better place so it 's i think it 's up to all of us to do it so that was a little bit of a rave but i have too much that was great thanks joel yeah so um we 're wrapping up now i was just wondering um whether any of the panelists had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we say farewell well i 'd i 'd just like to say that um i 'd just like everyone to put love back into the into nature and to really empathize with nature and start to feel how nature would be feeling if someone was stabbing you in the back and um you know look at the beauty and things and just absolutely appreciate it and certainly artists can do that farmers can do it the birds can do it um and let 's just all unite as one and get out get on and solve this problem we 've got because i do believe that we can there are solutions uh we 've got ourselves into the mess and we 've got the intelligence to get out of the mess too well said thanks joel just giving back more to the land than you take out of it jill yeah what do you think john [Music] yes i i think so uh but that night but i think it 's it 's interesting when you say we got ourselves into this mess with the with climate change and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think that my view is that uh we 're we 're heading for the most appalling um it probably is a disaster for the human race but i think that this regenerative farming thing that we 're talking about and treating the land in the right way will uh give it the land make a good land into more of a bulwark to cope with the next 50 or 40 50 or 60 years um i i feel it 's for me this is this whole project um that 's been one of the most important things i 've been thinking about because i 've painted um in the atacama desert in chile um where there was wonderful farms and um um that that that was overcome because not because they didn 't use proper farming methods and in in the sahara desert where which was all all gone so i i just think that the strongest thing i want to say about this project is that uh we are at least trying to make some kind of uh bulwark against uh the absolute appalling uh changes which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just humankind yeah yes yes well i think that 's probably a good point to to close our discussion on acknowledging the scale of the issues um that we 're facing but um you know hopefully finding a way to um approach what 's occurring with hope and and with joy and with love and and and as i as we open the session um hopefully a more just future for us all and for um the original custodians of of the farmlands that we 're talking about so thank you so much for everyone who has uh participated all the panelists uh everyone who 's been listening to the discussion and sending through questions thank you to aubrey library museum for organizing this show and thank you to to chris our producer who 's been in the background making everything run so smoothly us also say farewell and we 're going to end with a few uh photos and artworks um so you can get uh even more of a better sense of what what this project 's been all about so thank you everyone and goodbye thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um being so supportive of this whole project and you 've also helped in the background with the curation with kate from aubry um and also your encouragement through the national museum i mean that 's definitely helped lift the profile of earth canvas having your support so thank you oh great glad i 've been come help okay definitely thank you thank you foreign you"

    "text": "good afternoon everyone my name is karina clement i 'm the team leader of the aubry of aubrey cds library and museum and it gives me enormous pleasure today to welcome you all to the online opening of the inspirational earth canvas exhibition here at aubrey library museum i 'd firstly and most fittingly like to acknowledge the wiradjuri people as as the traditional custodians of the land that i am on today and pay my respects to the elders both part both past present and future so a little bit about the earth canvas project just a short introduction the earth canvas project invited contemporary artists to work on regenerative farms between the murray and the murrumbinji rivers in southern new south wales the project aims to link the artist 's perspective of the land with the farmers management of the land what is revealed in the resultant exhibition earth canvas to give it its full name earth canvas linking artists with regenerative farmers is the mutual creativity of approach of both farmer and artists and a deep empathy with the landscape earth canvas is a really important exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and partnership is definitely the word the concept and the the project really developed by the regional collaborative earth at earth canvas art in ag the exhibition was curated by aubry library library museum and supported by the national museum of australia and assistance with assistance from the australian government 's vision and visions of australia program so truly a partnership project throughout the opening today you will have the had the opportunity to hear from representatives of the earth canvas collaborative a participating artist and farmer the exhibition curator and special keynote address we 'll also have the opportunity opportunity towards the end for questions so please post your questions throughout on the chat function firstly though as you 're not able to be here in person today we have a three minute film that gives a flavor of the exhibition so so so so so so that was great i hope that provided a bit of an overview for you all and of course encouraged you to visit in person because we are actually open even though um even though the um the the launch is online the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to acknowledge the work of filmmaker helen newman in putting together that that short film it now gives me great pleasure to welcome and introduce jillian sambrook and jillian 's coming online now great jillian is the chairperson of the earth canvas collaborative and with the project team very much the vision and driving force behind the earth canvas art nag project jillian has many strings to herbo i have found out with past careers in journalism marketing business development and a deep as well as a deep interest and commitment to australian art most importantly jillian is a farmer employing the principles of regenerative farming at her property bibaringa one of the featured properties in the exhibition 18 months or so ago jill approached us at the aubrey library museum about the possibility of partnering in the development of the earth canvas exhibition i was in all really of the breadth and vision of the earth canvas project and what had already taken place we were on board from the start acknowledging the importance of the message and the creativity employed in delivering it the outcomes we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider earth canvas team and i look forward to jill providing us with an overview of the project over to you jill ah thank you karina welcome and i hope you all get to visit the exhibition here it 's a beautiful artwork and stories about the regenerative farmers and their journeys and the journey between the artists and the regendi farmer the concept of earth canvas started when was sitting around the kitchen table in braidwood they were talking about an art and farm exhibition up there and john warsley was actually there with me and i looked over to him and i said i think we could do something like this on a different scale and we basically shook hands on that and earth canvas basically set sail from there so i approached six artists that john had actually recommended um that is john walshly was one and he worked on my property bibaringa uh jenny bell who 's going to talk this this afternoon and janet lawrence who 's known internationally as we 're very well known in australia with the multimedia artists idris murphy a sydney-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abstract artist from albury and i also approached six farmers that are part of a group of support group farmers that i am part of in the riverina and southern new south wales are called eight families we 're all based on based in our management practices on holistic management and we meet every six weeks so five of the six farmers are actually eight family farmers it 's been a process where we i introduced the farmers to the artists and they the artists spend some time with the farmer and sorry uh i just went they they spent whatever time they wanted to and they heard each other 's story they could they connected so well with each other and didn 't realize the synergies that were with regenerative farmers and artists and from my perspective i was concerned about the mosaic patterns and the symmetry of the farmed landscape and how the man-made patterns have influenced the flow of the natural processes in our countryside so this triggered the idea of asking the farmers to actually link with farmers and because a lot of landscape artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they don 't necessarily go on to interfarm landscapes but in essence the two talk the same language the farmers talk with some very similar language maybe different words to the artist but they still connect very much on that level john worsley said once to me if you want to paint bamboo you need to paint and paint it until you become the bamboo and from a farmer 's perspective when i 'm making patterns in the landscape which could be a water contour to slow the water down through the landscape or a fence line or putting a dam in i 'm actually having it making a pattern or on the canvas of my property that i 'm working on at this point of time so you know we we do we did have very strong similarities and we had some indigenous local radri people come to some of the open days during the year the year and a half since we started and the first nation people talk the same language as what we did they just use different words as well like story lines and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process with earth canvas was that relationship with the artists and the farmer then we had six open days on the farms over during november 2019 where we had over 500 people attend this was all through social media on a very low budget because we started with money that was earned from the artist putting on workshops with other artists so that was very much an educational program so it was a low budget community based project then we went into started the exhibition phase which started january this year with the support of vision and of course the magnificent support from the aubrey city library and the staff there it 's truly a collaboration as karina said and it 's it 's the project is now going to go to nine different galleries and museums around four states of australia and finish at the national museum in canberra in 2022 so it 's certainly a vision that 's gone a long way with some amazing cooperation from a lot of people but probably our biggest thing is to try and incorporate everybody in the solution of birth canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us can select from far select their food and buy local food seasonal food and buy and encourage farmers to look after their landscape and regenerative farming is about profitable farming it 's about building the environment and about building economic outcomes for the farmer that 's managing the land so all in all it 's a win-win for everybody and also it 's a way of empowering everybody as part of the solution for climate change so i hope you get the opportunity to visit the um exhibition here at aubrey library museum up until the end of february early february 2021 it 's worthwhile and this is a high class exit art exhibition thank you and now i 'd like to move on to introduce you to a fellow farmer and member of the eight families support group rebecca gorman um hi rebecca rebecca she 's there with the murrumbidgee in the background i hope you can see it so they 've got about i think about six kilometers of murrumbidgee riverfront on their property which goes up in the hill country rebecca 's was born in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career it 's an abc journalist both australian and overseas and came back to farming she had a passion to get back onto the land she looked all over the country to see where she wanted to be and she ended up not far from where she was born but i 'll let you i 'll let you rebecca tell you her story um it 's a great one and her regenerative farming story um experience and with janet lawrence the artist that worked with her has been an enlightening process for all of us so over to you beck thank you jill thanks a lot uh i just want to uh say i 'm onyab three west here with the beautiful murrumbidgee in the background it 's foragery land i want to acknowledge local elders and hope to support the movement of emerging elders on their country on the day that we hosted earth canvas exactly a year ago this weekend we were lucky enough to be joined by damian kennedy who is first nation artist among other jobs that he has he led a group of young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his words of encouragement to us that day and i just want to acknowledge his contribution on the day and say how it left such a strong impression with everyone who was there originally those of us on the farming side in the eight families group uh who joined the earth canvas project were uh used to jill 's extraordinary enthusiasm and and project management and we were simply caught up with that enthusiasm uh but i don 't think any of us realized how it would turn out to just create this amazing life that it has it seemed like a fun idea and we just got on board and then i met the artist janet lawrence who was paired with us and i got caught up in her enthusiasm as well janet you may know her amazing work she works all over the world her work honors nature and she is revered for that work and it was one whirlwind uh pleasure to spend time with her and her husband brian walking through our paddocks marveling at our ancient river gums and having fresh creative eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we also had some really challenging conversations too she 's strong feisty joyful but she 's passionate about opening people 's minds to how we 've treated nature and i think it 's one of the lessons for all of us out of this project that we need to be a lot more creative about how we 're managing how we 're managing the land certainly uh as as regenerative farmers we 're trying to do that and we need uh all the help we can get uh then we had the actual day which was fantastic on so many levels we had around 80 people joining us from a whole range of different lives artists farmers teachers just people who 've seen it on facebook and said why don 't we go they camped on the river uh they just enjoyed the beauty of the place we suddenly had this little community that popped up i also had a great team of friends who rolled up and did all the cooking and helped out you know clear setting up cleaning all of those sorts of things and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle um and a bunch of um a group of ecologists uh other holistic farming people soil health specialists and we just had this beautiful day of discussion sharing stories and uh and a good bit of tree hugging on the river which was and and writing messages to trees on river stones it was really amazing and um really incredibly now it 's become an exhibition and i haven 't seen it yet i 'm really thrilled that to be i was excited about coming down and we planned to come my little support team we 're planning to do a little road trip so i encourage other people to do the same and i think what i have learnt from it though is a reminder for all of us to get out of our silos we tend to work and live in our specializations um but i think if we 're to make the shifts necessary to claw back the biodiversity that we 've lost the communities that we 've lost to create some climate calm then what a great trigger earth canvas is we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to think outside our silos and our ways of being so earth canvas i think is a great example of that and i can say i know on behalf of all the farmers involved that it was such an enriching process and experience and we congratulate everybody who was involved in getting earth canvas up and running and now getting this exhibition going jill we especially uh create especially congratulate you for your uh for your vision and leadership uh it 's been such a great privilege to be involved and i hope that it 's a great creative trigger for everybody who comes to the exhibition thanks a lot thank you vic um it is about creativity and i think that we as a human race tend to forget that we have all got creativity in us it 's just a matter of tapping into it and particularly people working with nature which is all a natural a beautiful creation in itself so i 'd like to now introduce you to jenny bell and jenny 's artwork is when she was speaking at the introduction just to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jenny works with um jenny was working at mount marinara which is with michael and anna coughlin it 's a property at holbrook they 've got a big herd of cattle about 82 000 cows and calves in one mob of cattle it 's a beautiful property on the backdrop of the magama national park in the background but jenny came from because comes from around goldman and her artwork she farmer a regenerative farmer as well as an artist but she didn 't set out to be an artist she wasn 't one of those artists that painted when they were a child and that her destination was always going to be art she came came to it as a young adult and most of her painting has been done on her farm so originally it was interesting when she came on was asked to come on to earth canvas she was rather nervous and i 'll let jenny just tell you her story that she works in multi-medium media and she did train and the sydney did a bachelor of arts at the national art school in sydney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you jenny thank you thanks jill um i think i 've been chosen to represent us because i i was at all the field days i saw i was there for rebecca 's day and the smoking ceremony i saw the kites fly and every one of those days had a special quality about them and so i 'm i 'm here to represent the artist i think because i was there at all of those occasions um i think um i firstly like to say we often think of art as decoration you know it 's the icing on the cake of life but actually they 're inside the cake and i think i speak for all the artists involved in saying that we were thrilled and heartened that our activity our visual thinking and insights were recognised as having potentially important contributions to make when we were matched with um innovative and practical farmers just to see what would happen i 've spent most of my life on farms and as jill said i i um i 've kept those two worlds fairly separate and i slightly hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a revelation to realize that at their core as has been said just before they aren 't really so different after all our mainstream farms reflect industrial society we 've artificially pushed production almost beyond nature 's limits but the farmers we work with teachers how to work within nature 's limits enhancing not only production but the flourishing ecosystem that supports it and in the process they 've introduced us to the wonder the intuition and dare i say the spiritual dimension in the most practical activity farming ah we weren 't just us to paint the landscape we were invited into the homes and working lives of the farmers and shown an intimate glimpse of people in the process of reinventing a farmer 's relationship to their land they observe plan build fences and move their animals responding to nature 's signals nature in response begins to make her own arrangements as rebecca said as artists we do something similar observing planning building and then the moments come when the process takes over and we tune into an inner voice in other words nature begins to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human at odds with nature and it isn 't surprising the answer 's all around us but these farmers show us that it doesn 't have to be the case and while each farm is a small ecosystem within a bigger one its solutions are particular to place and circumstances these farmers regenerating the land do show us the potential a thoughtful interaction when humans ask different questions change patterns in their thinking and place their faith in nature as artists i think we are always listening for that inner voice wondering if what was there yesterday will guide us today trusting that if we turn up those new patterns will emerge so accepting uncertainty and change is second nature to us we can really identify with the transformative process these farmers are experiencing i can 't speak each artist in the project but i bet as i finish by thanking the farmers for taking us on they 'll identify in some way with my experience of working at mount nara nara with michael and anna it opened me to a part of myself i 'd never had previously access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for more than that so i i thank the farmers i thank all of the organisers i think the auburn museum and um i think jill sandra you know she 's her vision as the energy behind this and i thank the artist for for allowing me to represent them and i hope you know um some way represented the way you all feel that 's my sense and thank you all oh thank you thank you jenny thank you rebecca and jill fantastic to hear your insights and your really heartfelt insights and perspectives we have another insight now or another perspective i 'd like to introduce katie stick kate is a member of our team here at the library museum she 's exhibition curator at aubrey library museum and quite specifically the curator of the earth canvas exhibition i know that kate has been totally thrilled to work on this project and to look forward to to to your words over to you kate thank you karina um i also would like to acknowledge the rajeri people as traditional custodians of the land and pay my respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the development of this exhibition was attending the open day at mount narenara it was a beautiful clear day and actually i was so struck by the beauty that i stopped at the gate to take photos i just moved from melbourne to begin my new role at the library museum walking through the paddocks to view jenny 's work and sitting shaded by trees hearing about the environmentally conscious work that was being undertaken felt like an exciting new world my knowledge of agricultural practice was pretty much non-existent but i remember walking away feeling uplifted and optimistic by the discussions that had occurred not typically feelings i associated with farming the next stage was to meet with the farmers of the participating properties to discuss their experiences and regenerative practice i was so excited at the prospect of visiting all the farms but the emergence of the global pandemic meant that these discussions needed to go virtual i actually spoke with joy yamikoona over the phone while she was in the paddocks highlighting the vital importance of what farmers do whilst our cities and towns were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or transitioning to working from home or getting stopped on farms in a period of such a people the need for fresh produce to feed people remains unchanged i would personally like to take this opportunity to thank our farmers for taking the time to speak with me and for their generosity and openness in sharing their experiences and knowledge with me when writing interpretive text there is a need for brevity and focus which sadly means many of the wonderful stories and anecdotes you find in the research stage do not make it into the catalogue or onto the walls there are too many dimension here but some of the standouts included a story of an inventive young boy who was determined to rescue a sheep that had gotten caught in willow branches in a river another memorable story also including innovation was about the use of animal guts being used for compox uh mixing them with wood chips and composting liquid keeping it sealed in plastic had managed to keep the dogs out but a large garand i had gone in to into investigating caused quite a fright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artists involved in the project both personally and professionally this was an extraordinary opportunity to gain insight into the processes behind the production of the works featured in this exhibition again there are many standout points in these discussions that sadly didn 't make it into the exhibition but there will be opportunities throughout the exhibition period to hear directly from our participating and farmers in a series of in conservation events i absolutely encourage you to attend these if you can while there is a diversity of art forms practiced by our featured artists what struck me in this fascinating conversation was the deep engagement and immersion with their subject matter that all the artists shared connection on both a practical and emotional level is one that kept emerging throughout the development of this exhibition the connection between the farmers and their land was immediately palatable and in fact nearly all the farmers commented that since implementing regenerative farming they have found a greater awareness and appreciation of the land another connection that was frequently commented on was the friendships that formed between the farmers and the artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinship that developed as both parties explored their relationship to the regenerating landscape it is appropriate that this sense of connection is so strong as it was a key purpose of this exhibition project when discussing the aims of the exhibition it was established it was to be an opportunity for the broader community to learn about regenerative agriculture and to engage with the land and food production practices the extraordinary artworks featured in this exhibition and the experiences and insights of participating farmers and artists provide an opportunity for us to find that connection thanks kate thank you very much so we 're now we we were lucky enough to um have two keynote speakers um who we have we have had to pre-record pre-record their talk but i 'll give a brief introduction dr patrice newell left the tv industry in 1987 to become a sustainable land manager and writer researcher dedicated to developing and communicating improved agricultural systems and innovations in an era of rapid climate change elmswood farm in the hunter valley has been her obsession ever since she lives at elmswood farm with her partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and philip are our keynote speakers today we have had as i 've said we have pre-recorded patrice and phillip phillips contribution however the reality of australia 's regional and rural internet connection means the visual quality of the recording is not great just as a warning the audio and therefore the message though comes through loud and clear i 'll pass now to patrice and phillip hi i 'm patrice newell speaking to you in this climate emergency from our farm elmswood at gundy with philip adams here agriculture in australia only produces around 61 billion dollars worth of produce yet it is our third biggest sector emitting greenhouse gases that 's after electricity and transport beef production is the main game there 's 25 million head of cattle walking around australia the same number as about people and most of the animals are exported now right now we are in a revolutionary point in our agricultural history as we come to terms with the fact that we are living right now in this climate emergency and we have to do agriculture differently so that we can reduce our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can to sequester carbon never before has photosynthesis been so important on the one hand the scale of the problem is almost impossible to comprehend and it 's hard to feel that an individual can make a difference while at the same time in agriculture actually make a living that 's why earth canvas is such a brilliant idea where land managers get some inspiration from artists help you know help us as agricultural managers see things differently be inspired and find great enthusiasm and of course always connections are really important for all of us not just artists but farmers as well this funny old house of ours is not only our home it 's home to my collections of collections collect everything tens of thousands of books every book i 've ever read since william and biggles uh a vast collection of movies and antiquities you can probably glimpse between us over the shoulder some roman egyptian tombs there 's lots of egyptian stuffing ancient greek aztec heavens above it 'd be hard to find something that isn 't here but we also collect paintings many of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the humans see landscapes through the prisms of their painters they see england through the paintings of constable they see much of france through van gogh and suzanne australia well the list is very very long but one thinks of well for instance nolan we think of of uh well john walshly is another we think of and and and janet lawrence so many people who help us see the world around us i had an adventure like that i was in a melbourne tram 50 years ago going down um going down the street and out of the window i happened to glimpse in a junk shop window something that looked a bit familiar so i jump off the tram run down the hill charged into the shop and there i found this and a landscape of italy view of all vieto by an obscure artist called turner i bought this turner for a tenner and if you think that 's lucky how much luckier it is if you can actually paint images paint landscapes yourself i can 't i can 't paint a front door let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this project which i find so commendable i rely on you to do the paintings so we can see our country more clearly and more vividly so get suck into the painting and congratulations on this wonderful exhibition well i think we consider the exhibition now well and truly launched thank you patrice and phillip and i think we all loved his turner for a tennis story um i 'd love to i think we 'd all have to get a love to get a bargain that like that so look we 're now able to bring back all the speakers obviously except for patrice and phillip for a q a opportunity so please um send any questions you you have into the into the chat on your um whatever channel you 're working on um whilst we get the questions together i just want to give you a little bit more information about the exhibition as jillian has said it 's on display here at the library museum until the 7th of february then anticipated to tour to a number of galleries and museums across new south wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of programs attached to the exhibition and i think kate and jillian have alluded to that some online some on site at the library museum and some fantastic farm-based programs a really opportunity to to to go to to some of the farms and and view the regenerative agriculture and practice um please check out these this diversity of programs online either through the aubry city earth campus webpage or the earth canvas organization webpage and just before we get into some questions i 've we 've got a couple of comments from the audience from our online audience out there um comment from susie parallels between creativity and farming looks and she 's looking forward to see the exhibition in real life um comment from peter what an excellent way to build awareness of the link between art farming life creativity also promoting health and farming practices for the land and sustainability yeah i think there are some really um quarantine key messages in in um as part of the project um and it 's the messages are using art to pass those messages on is a really creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ michelle for jenny as an artist so how would the knowledge of regenerative agriculture formulate your future ongoing practice do you think generally because you you did say it was a was it kind of a light bulb time for you yeah okay well thank you i it was a light bulb but one of um the tricks of being an artist is the light bulb goes off but the light doesn 't go on yet uh you got to earn that you got to work pretty hard for the light for the for the for the light to uh to spread and show you uh so i think michelle was it i think um perhaps the biggest lesson is trust have you know have faith in nature the nature that travels through us as the farmers have faith that nature will travel and do its work on their farms if they set up the framework it won 't happen unless you you create the framework as farmers they create the framework for nature to work at its optimum and as artists we just got to keep turning up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and i 'll let you know down the track just the result but but i but i can 't predict that and that 's why we 're artists because we like the adventure i mean sometimes it 's not so easy but uh you know if you look at it something will shine yep great yeah thanks um i have a question now from from genevieve for rebecca hi rebecca says jen how did janet 's practice and i think she means alter the way or make you left a word out but i think probably change the way you see your farm if it did i think the thing about hanging out with janet in the paddock was just that every tree she looked at she could see beauty in it not just oh that 's a lovely tree but oh my god look at that how beautiful is that tree and it just reminded you you know australians we can be quite sort of laconic and laid back and oh yeah you know and we 're not always overly expressive about how we feel about things uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity the freedom to say actually you 're right that is incredible and we were down on the river with these beautiful river guns that were upwards of 400 years years old and more and i think for most australians who aren 't uh indigenous australians that is a bit mind-blowing we can 't quite understand the what what that really means about your land so it is um spending time with someone like janet just gets you you get smacked in the face a little bit by what beauty surrounds you what history and you know and and it reminds you i think one of the other questions in there is about letting go and letting nature do its work and um one of the things that gets said often in the regenerative sphere is to sort of get off the neck of nature stop interfering all the time and i think jenny you 've you 've referred to that to get into you and then see what comes out it 's not easy and it 's not neat and it 's messy and it 's complex so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um she 's been she 's been looking at it for so long that she was i think happy to let the process of um confusion and complexity actually occur and it was just beautiful to be with her yeah yeah it looked great and i had we have an a comment from another of the audience really similar comments to the ones you 've just made rebecca comment from barbara i loved the words about the farmer making a plan but then nature makes her own arrangements indeed we think we can force our plans but that doesn 't work short short term um so there is a question at the top here sorry i 'm just trying to get back up there um and this is a question probably for um for jill and rebecca and you 've really kind of alluded to it rebecca but i 'll pass it to jill would you consider regenerative agriculture as letting go learning to work with nature absolutely i mean white man since he came to australia seems to want to control the land and that 's what they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they farmed land and sure we 've got to feed people and livestock etc but a lot of trees uh been cut down without acknowledgement that the the importance of the trees and how that affects all the other ecosystem components that make up one the one ecosystem that is the functioning so i think it 's um really important that we go get get back to basics and we go right back and teach our children the importance of nature in our landscapes going into the future yep um on another question jill um for you from greg how seriously are these conversations and perspectives being taken by mainstream agriculture and and other people can answer but i 'll pass them to you first jill are they seen as a threat rather than an opportunity or indeed even an imperative well it 's a free world we live in so everyone can make their choices ultimately farmers are business people so they have choices as the way they want to manage their farms so it there is that division happening where the people said that the users and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't see it like that at all i mean there 's a choice you make in the way you run your business um but i think now it 's becoming a little bit more apparent with the concern that we have about the condition of the planet with climate change so we have to address some of the decisions that have been made by a lot of farmers that have becoming more corporate decisions there 's a huge marketing wheel turning there that are influencing the education of agriculturalists and the use of inputs into farming that is in many ways uh taking it away from the decision-making processes of considering environment is important part of that decision making so um there 's definitely room for regenerative agriculture it 's not for everybody but and in in this lifetime i may not see virginia agriculture be the major form of agriculture and on our planet but it 's growing the wheels have turned um there 's so much publicity coming out about regenerative agriculture that it 's not going to turn back it 's only going to keep going because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hand we 've got apart from the health of the planet we 've got help of individuals we 've got massive problems with our food systems our wastage of food i think something like 30 of the food that is produced is not actually being consumed by human beings because of wastage and distribution we 've still got starving people so it 's not a matter of producing more food it 's a better there 's a lot of other things to consider to make that the production line of food chain function properly but i 'd like to hear a comment from rebecca and jenny on on this too yeah me too rebecca uh look i think i think we are managing the global commons and it 's not really when i mentioned silos it 's not really about are you in agriculture what kind of agriculture do you do we know now we know that there is a problem we know that agriculture has a problem we know that the whole world has a problem so it 's not really about whether you 're one thing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms it 's just well what kind of response uh what what sort of response are you going to have to the way you produce things and you don 't have to call it anything at all you just have to respond in a way that is responsible for producing um a footfall repairing the damage that we have done and continue to do so let 's not get caught up on phrases and let 's not get stuck in the silos that say that you do one thing one way i mean if it were any other industry and there was a problem and then there were solutions they would just take it up they wouldn 't get caught in caught in the culture of well i couldn 't possibly do it some other way so i think let 's uh you know let 's just you know that 's down in that that 's down in the wings dare i use a term like that uh let 's let 's operate at a much higher level than that yeah we are regenerative farmers aren 't we i mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to degenerate the land so there are people saying that we don 't like it 's becoming a cult we don 't want to be seen as regenerative farmers but that 's basically every farmer should be regenerating the landscape that 's our natural resource don 't deteriorate your your resource base yeah i wouldn 't want to do that and you call it something else call it revitalize call it conservation farming call it whatever you like but just do whatever you need to do to make sure that your that your ecologies are cycling as best as they can it 's jenny have you got anything you 'd like to add on that okay um i think change is hard in any walk of life and as rebecca alluded to it 's particularly hard in in a situation where traditions are handed down through the generations to turn those traditions on their head takes a bit of courage and these farmers have all shown that courage um people can 't be bullied into doing it i think um there are tremendous commercial forces at work agribusiness has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products so as we as consumers have tremendous opportunity to put um well i guess how much where our mouth is and help these farmers transition give them the signals that say listen this is what we want is it you know we are very connected the city in the country we need each other and if the city and the towns give farmers the signals they 'll respond it will it will give them the courage to respond that they are doing what commercial forces are pushing them to do what tradition is forcing them to do and show them uh that you support another way and they 'll that they 'll come on board you know it 's so exciting you couldn 't help but want to be part of it when you when you when you 're when you cross that bridge you know we 've got to help them get on the bridge and once they 're on it you know uh you know it 's really an exciting place to be yeah great kate is there anything you 'd like to add about how an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of the exhibition is to pass that message on about regeneration and the importance of it is there anything you 'd like to add about how your curating of the exhibition has um how you curated the exhibition to kind of maximize those messages to me it was really important to and i think this was something that that we identified very on early on in the process was that it was not about being didactic we didn 't you know we weren 't finger-wagging um we wanted to share share the stories um raise awareness and to me it 's been quite a conscious decision in curating the exhibition uh to focus on those individual experiences uh and to you know bring in a little bit of the science as well but certainly make it make it accessible and and really encourage a conversation and you know just to join the conversation and to put some thought in and i think that that 's as as jenny said you know getting people on the bridge getting people to to think about these things because so often it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long held practice and you know i think as i alluded to you know it was such a surprise coming in at the mount narayanara open day and and talking with this positivity about how agricultural practice could have positive impacts for the planet and that was just a completely different narrative to one that i 've grown up with so i think yeah i certainly hope that that 's something that comes through um for the exhibition yeah thanks kate um and maybe our final was actually a question that i probably know the answer to question from angela would there be an opportunity for the farmers to present their stories at the exhibition say a talk on the introduction of how to begin and where to learn regenerative farming methods um jill that there 's a whole range of programs isn 't there that um accompany the exhibition and some of them are more regenerative farming focused some some are artist talks there are artisan farmers farmer talks um some are on actually on the farm so hopefully if you have a look on the website angela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aubrey library museum slash earth canvas you 'll you 'll find information about about the range of programs and hopefully that will um some of that information will be there but is there anything else um jill you 'd like to add um like an introduction on how to begin and where to learn regenerative farming methods what 's a good starting point well there 's some fabulous books out the call of the read warbler by charles massey um there 's youtube 's galore um books all around that are easy just bring it google regent of agriculture uh there 's also his latest book jill i that knows nothing about farming that 's a great introduction yeah if you did everything in the world everything on the farm can go but the most important thing on the place you 'll never part with is the bees i 'm not sure about philip i 'm sure he can stay as well but so the beads are she says that it 's a very important function and you know in america at the moment so we 've really got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources in the catalogue on the websites yeah yeah great um so yeah there is a lot of information already out there and look the earth canvas website is also a line of information too is there any final words anyone would like to say before we finish off rebecca is there anything else you 'd like to say that you haven 't you you know anything urgently that you 'd like to pass on uh look i think it probably comes back to this issue that we were referring to before um this this and what i 've learned from earth canvas uh this is our land that we all share it 's for all of us to share and it 's been a great opportunity in earth canvas to have an avenue to share it and i think that goes also to the conversation about regenerative ag it 's not you know terminologies it 's about sharing and rebuilding uh this incredible nature that we are lucky enough to live in as farmers and to be able to somehow share that better with everybody else around especially a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melbournians who have probably haven 't had as much of a nature fix as they really need they need to get out into some countryside and get their toes in some soil to recover agreed um kate any last words from you um look i mean i think i would just say that it 's been an incredible uh exhibition to work on and reiterate my my gratitude to to jill and your canvas team and our farmers and and the artists and i mean to me it 's just it 's it 's a wonderful outcome that it 's such a an informative but optimistic exhibition as well yeah great jenny anything from you um i 'd like to thank john walshly for for gathering the artists um for setting such an example over so many years uh i think um yeah i 'd just like to say thank you john great and jill any luck oh well apart from thanking the whole team of artists and farmers and the the wonderful work that the aubrey library museum has done i 'd just like to add that really nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative for people just to tap in give themselves the time to be creative and i think if we can all start to understand our inner self and connect with nature we can only ever get the compassion and see the beauty in the world and then it 'll all start to happen so i 'd like to finish on that note because that 's where i get my true true inner feelings of connectivity and beauty and joy in the world is when i 'm on my property um just being so yeah thank you that that was that was lovely um well thank you very much everyone um i 'll just give a little preview of our next online event we we do have some on-site events but our next online event we 'll delve more deeply into the themes and issues discussed today um the online panel discussion will be two weeks time for the same place 4 30 online facilitated by dr george mayne who is both head of the anthropocene australian curatorial center and a senior curator at the national museum of australia and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tony knott john woolsey artist michael coughlin farmer and jillian fanbrook um so again thank you very much thank you to all participants the wider earth canvas team the museum team the libraries and museum team for the hosting of the exhibition and for this event the event has been recorded so it 'll be available um through the auburn city website and i believe the earth canvas facebook page i 'd like to thank you all for attending and look forward to seeing you all at the next event we 'll be finishing up with some images from the exhibition but thank you thank you everyone goodbye thanks karina thank you thanks so you"
